            <p>
                In the heart of the volcano, the remnants left behind by the sages yearned for their successors.

Risking her life, his mother obtained the Immortal Palace Seal, handing it to Ning Zhuo before her passing.

“The Buddha Heart Demon Seal!”

To transcend into either Buddha or the Demon.

With this seal grasped firmly, he could inscribe a heart seal and command the creation of puppets.

While ordinary individuals struggled under the weight of just controlling a few, the burden was exceptionally light for, Ning Zhuo, who effortlessly commanded tens of thousands with a single gesture.

“Mother, I will fulfill your wishes and obtain the Immortal Palace!” He vowed.

Indeed.

Immortal Puppets; capable of spiritual secrets; their work skillful and rational.

A new realm is opened up, and things are in sync with the heavens.

The ancient bell echoes the laws. The moon dances under the clear light.

Embodied with myriad strengths, who in this world dares oppose?
