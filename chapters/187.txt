Chapter 187: How the Righteous Ning Zhuo Uses Clan Blood and Flesh

In recent days, Ning Zhuo had been devising a brand-new mechanical body for Yuan Dasheng.

The Tree Martial Ape he had previously designed and refined had been completely destroyed in the battle with Cheng Bai.

The Golden Blood Battle Ape was suitable for use within the Lava Immortal Palace, but not ideal for external use. Mainly, when facing Golden Core Stage cultivators, the material specifications were significantly lacking.

Of course, the Lava Immortal Palace provided many opportunities. The Golden Blood Battle Ape would be upgraded in due course.

The second Buddhist Gate and the three checkpoints thereafter had already provided higher-grade materials specifically for upgrading the Golden Blood Battle Ape.

In the previous joint operation of the three factions, the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng had showcased its might after material replacements and enhancements.

"In terms of potential, the Golden Blood Battle Ape clearly has much more."

Ning Zhuo still hadn't fully understood the design of the Golden Blood Battle Ape, including the materials used for its body.

The Golden Blood Battle Ape originated from the Golden Furnace, and even the three sects' Nascent Soul Stage experts had only set up eight of them within the Lava Immortal Palace.

Of course, Ning Zhuo was unaware of the Golden Furnace's existence.

After his attempts at analysis, he confirmed that the Golden Blood Battle Ape crafted by the Lava Immortal Palace was indeed extraordinary.

"Even if I never fully understand its structure, as long as I continuously replace its materials, I can rapidly enhance the combat power of the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng." The Tree Martial Ape Dasheng was strong due to its materials. At the time, due to Zheng Jian, the material grade was far superior to that of the Golden Blood Battle Ape.

However, in terms of design philosophy, there was nothing unique, and the intricate design was also lacking. Another issue was that the blueprint for the Tree Martial Ape had already been leaked.

Zheng Jian knew it very well.

Of course, this was because the blueprint itself wasn't highly valuable, so Ning Zhuo had shared it to deepen his relationship with Zheng Jian.

Ning Zhuo wanted to emulate the success of the Tree Martial Ape.

He aimed to refine a mechanical ape with Golden Core Stage combat power to ensure his own safety.

Especially in the current situation, with a large influx of unfamiliar cultivators into Fire Persimmon Immortal City, and Ning Zhuo becoming the controller of the black market, he was somewhat in the spotlight, making the need for Golden Core Stage combat power urgent.

Cheng Bai was actually at the Golden Core Stage.

His Golden Core was hidden within the Netherworld Envoy puppet, providing it with power and more.

The materials for the Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai also needed replacement. Forcing out Golden Core level power would cause the puppet's materials to collapse.

But since Cheng Bai's spirituality hadn't reached ten percent, even if it did, he would still need to find a way to pass the Spiritual Movement Stage, so he wasn't Ning Zhuo's first choice.

Ning Xie had the innate talent of Snow Soul Ice Essence and was refined into the Ice Snow Weather Sphere.

Its materials were good and could be upgraded.

Although its spirituality was low, Ning Xie was a member of the Ning family, and his relics could be collected to supplement its spirituality, making it very hopeful to achieve ten percent transformation and advance to the Spiritual Movement Stage.

However, Ning Xie was only at the Foundation Establishment Stage in life, and the mechanical structure of the Ice Snow Weather Sphere differed greatly from his original form. Relying on materials to exert Golden Core level power was possible but limited.

After careful consideration, Ning Zhuo determined that Yuan Dasheng was his best choice.

Yuan Dasheng's spirituality didn't need supplementation and had already passed the Spiritual Movement Stage.

He had Golden Core level combat power in life. His close-combat fighting style could better utilize the material advantages.

Most importantly, his righteous bones were as strong as gold, a celestial talent!

"Yuan Dasheng had mastered the Demonic Blood Vein Technique in life, and at a high level."

"Even as a mechanical construct, he can still use the Demonic Blood Vein Technique, just like Cheng Bai can still use the Nine Turns Soul Devouring Technique." Using the Demonic Blood Vein Technique required essence blood.

Therefore, Ning Zhuo planned to refine the Blood Transformation Pool and blood oil bottle as mechanical components.

At this point, Ning Zhuo suddenly thought of himself, triggering an inspiration.

Ning Zhuo secretly contacted Sun Lingtong again.

Ning Zhuo: "The Blood Transformation Pool consumes the bodies of other beings, transforming them into essence blood, which becomes Yuan Dasheng's source of power."

"Yuan Dasheng can use the blood and flesh of others to refine essence blood for his use. So why can't he use my blood and flesh?"

"He mastered the Demonic Blood Vein Technique in life, and using my blood and flesh to refine essence blood means the essence blood is essentially mine."

"Then, if I have him infuse the essence blood back into me, wouldn't that be a shortcut for cultivation?"

Sun Lingtong nodded: "Little Zhuo, there's no problem with this idea, but are you sure you want to do this?"

"You'll have to constantly cut your flesh and bleed."

Ning Zhuo showed a determined expression: "As long as I can cultivate faster, what is a little pain and suffering?"

"Brother Sun, do you remember when I was a child, you used iron rods and steel whips to train me to endure pain?"

"Thanks to your special training, I no longer fear pain!"

"Now, I'm just cutting my flesh and bleeding, it's like revisiting my childhood training."

Sun Lingtong felt a bit nauseous but laughed heartily, patting Ning Zhuo on the shoulder: "Good lad, my efforts in training you back then weren't in vain." Sun Lingtong was very pleased.

As a member of the demonic faction, he loved adventure and admired the strong.

Ning Zhuo's strong character made him very appreciative.

"A real man should be like this, daring to fight, ruthless to others, and even more ruthless to himself!"

"If you need my help, just say the word."

Ning Zhuo said: "Brother Sun, I'll give you the mechanical blueprints. Please help me refine a mechanical ape equipped with the Blood Transformation Pool and blood oil bottle."

"I'm pressed for time and under a lot of scrutiny, so it's not convenient for me!"

"No problem!" Sun Lingtong patted his chest in assurance.

Thanks to Ning Zhuo sharing the mechanical tomes left by his mother with Sun Lingtong long ago.

Although Sun Lingtong didn't have much talent in mechanics, his perseverance over the past decade had accumulated enough expertise.

In just two days, Sun Lingtong had refined the mechanical ape.

Ning Zhuo secretly took it for his own use.

In the depths of the floating clouds, he extracted Yuan Dasheng's spirituality and infused it into the mechanical ape.

Then, Ning Zhuo took out a sharp dagger, first drawing his own blood, then cutting flesh from his arm, thigh, and abdomen.

Waves of pain continuously assaulted his body and mind, but Ning Zhuo remained silent, only furrowing his brows and turning slightly pale.

Yuan Dasheng did not disappoint, using the ninth level of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique to refine the flesh and blood into essence blood.

Ning Zhuo received the essence blood infusion, and his Qi Sea cultivation advanced rapidly!

Three days later.

Ning Zhuo went to the underground base to see Sun Lingtong and share the good news.

Sun Lingtong was astonished: "Little Zhuo, I knew your previous Qi Sea cultivation. How did you advance to the peak of the sixth level so quickly?"

"Even though you cut your flesh and bled to supply Yuan Dasheng, you still need time to heal your wounds."

Ning Zhuo smiled: "Brother Sun, after cutting myself a few times, I suddenly realized a better method."

"I found that just cutting my own flesh and healing myself greatly slowed my cultivation speed."

"Why not ask my clan members for help?"

Sun Lingtong: "?!"

Ning Zhuo explained how he operated.

Many of the Ning clan members had cultivation, most at the Qi Refining Stage.

These people found it hard to make a living in the Immortal City, often engaging in low-paying labor like weeding, blacksmithing, fire-starting, and preliminary herb processing.

So, most of the Ning clan members preferred to rely on the family and work in family businesses.

But the family business had limited scale and positions.

Most of the Ning clan members, with limited cultivation, could only engage in low-level labor.

Ning Zhuo knew this situation and ordered his Foundation Establishment cultivators to select some of the poorer clan members to donate essence blood.

In return, Ning Zhuo would give each of them a sum of spirit stones after each blood and flesh donation.

Ning Zhuo said: "I did the math.

"Although they get injured, they receive a sum of spirit stones. They can use these spirit stones to buy the cheapest medicine to heal, and still have more than half left."

"They profit!"

"So, this initiative was widely welcomed. Many clan members who weren't selected volunteered."

With so much flesh and blood, Yuan Dasheng cultivated the ninth level of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique's blood power.

In the process of infusing Ning Zhuo, this blood power would be purified by Ning Zhuo, leaving what suited his physique, and the rest would be returned to Yuan Dasheng as his backup source of power.

"With this method, my cultivation problem in the Qi Sea is solved. Hahaha." Ning Zhuo was very pleased.

Sun Lingtong was his most trusted person.

Whenever he had a breakthrough or progress, he would immediately share it with Sun Lingtong.

But Sun Lingtong's next words were a bit ungrateful.

He frowned, thought for a moment, and suddenly realized: "Your method still uses your clan members, treating them as cultivation materials. Essentially, it's no different from those demonic methods."

Ning Zhuo: ...

"Cough, cough, cough!" He coughed violently, "Brother Sun, you can't say that."

"I'm helping my clan members, giving them work. Their income has increased because of me."

"You didn't see their genuine smiles when they received the spirit stones."

"When I see their smiles, my heart warms."

Ning Zhuo emphasized: "I'm helping them solve their livelihood problems and improve their living standards."

"And with their help, my cultivation accelerates, achieving higher results. This is a mutually beneficial and win-win situation, a successful example of righteous cooperation!"

After a pause, he added: "I am fundamentally different from those demonic cultivators!"

"They are cruel and cold-blooded, harming their own kin for personal gain. Such people are terrifying!"

"My clan members are all voluntary."

"Our cooperation doesn't harm their lives!"

"Although it injures them, these wounds can be healed with some medicine over time."

"After healing, they can cooperate with me more times..."

Sun Lingtong clapped his hands: "I get it."

"Those demonic cultivators slaughter their kin for a one-time gain. But you, my little brother, plan to continuously and steadily obtain flesh and blood."

"Cough, cough, cough!" Ning Zhuo coughed violently again.

"Brother Sun, I can't talk to you anymore."

"I am righteous!"

"Righteous!!"

Sun Lingtong spread his hands: "Alright, say whatever you want."

Ning Zhuo sighed, sincerely and earnestly: "Brother Sun, you can't think like this. Although you come from a major demonic sect, you should broaden your horizons and open your mind, not always seeing things so darkly."

"You've known me for over a decade. Do you think I'm that kind of person?!"

Sun Lingtong: ...
