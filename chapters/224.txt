Chapter 224: Heart in Turmoil

"You all spend your days immersing your souls in the Immortal Palace, excluding me, forcing me to take the path of physically entering the Immortal Palace. But speaking of it, I should thank you all, especially Ning Zhuo. Haha, you opened up a whole new world for me. Thirty years east of the river, thirty years west of the river, never underestimate a young girl in distress."

"When I achieve something in the future, standing before you, looking down on you, I eagerly anticipate your shocked expressions!" The more Ning Xiaohui thought about it, the more excited she became, feeling that her days were full of hope and prospects.

Especially not long ago, she received a direct order from Zhu Xuanjiâ€”commanding her to fully seize the relevant positions in the Historical Records Pavilion.

Ning Xiaohui gladly accepted the order!

"As long as I accomplish this task well, I will be appreciated by the Golden Core Patriarchs and catch their eyes." However, at this moment, including Zhu Xuanji, the eyes of the Golden Core Patriarchs were all on Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo's previous suspicions were correct.

Before leaving, Zhu Xuanji had secretly set up means to monitor him, both on his person and in his residence.

After discussing with the three Golden Core Patriarchs, the Golden Core cultivators of the three families also secretly moved, gradually hiding around Ning Zhuo.

Each of them used various methods, setting up means around Ning Zhuo to observe him at all times.

They were hunters lying in wait, hiding around Ning Zhuo, quietly waiting for the City Lord's Mansion to make a mistake.

Ning Zhuo's Residence.

Under the silent watch of the six Golden Core Patriarchs, Ning Zhuo took out a pill and swallowed it to heal himself.

After resting, he looked around.

In front of the Golden Core Patriarchs, he performed various detection spells, then used magical artifacts for detection, and even manipulated formations to investigate.

In the end, he found nothing suspicious.

Ning Zhuo was only at the Qi Refining Stage, and even though the magical artifacts he used were of high quality and the formations were at the Foundation Establishment level, he couldn't detect the presence of the Golden Core Patriarchs.

Ning Zhuo's actions, in the eyes of the Golden Core Patriarchs, were quite amusing and made them laugh.

Ning Zhuo then summoned the guards outside his house.

These people were former stewards of the Ning family, all with Foundation Establishment cultivation.

Ning Zhuo instructed them to guard the surroundings strictly and asked if there were any suspicious individuals around.

The guards all replied: there were no suspicious situations or individuals.

Ning Zhuo was alone in the underground cultivation room.

He sighed, took out the classics of mechanical techniques, and began to study them, frowning as he read.

After reading for a short while, he couldn't continue.

He put the classics aside, went to the workbench, and started tinkering with various mechanical parts.

After tinkering for a while, Ning Zhuo sighed deeply again and pushed all the mechanical parts on the table away.

Many parts scattered on the ground.

Ning Zhuo reached out, grabbed his hair, and repeatedly banged his forehead on the table, letting out painful cries.

"The little guy's heart is in turmoil."

The six Golden Core Patriarchs, seeing this scene, felt that Ning Zhuo was restless, unable to read or study mechanical techniques.

His pressure was too great!

Ning Zhuo banged his broad forehead until it was red, then released his fingers and lay weakly on the table, eyes closed, like a dead man.

He maintained this posture for a long time, then suddenly opened his eyes and sat up abruptly.

He grabbed his hair again and let out painful howls.

But this time, he didn't howl for long before standing up and pacing back and forth in the underground secret room.

His brows were tightly knit, and his face was solemn.

He walked back and forth, sometimes stopping to sigh deeply, sometimes crying out in pain, as if venting.

Sometimes his eyes reddened, and he walked to the corner, pressing his head against the wall, using his forehead to compete with the wall without using any magical power.

The Golden Core Patriarchs watched silently, some frowning slightly.

Zhu Xuanji's eyes flickered slightly, his face solemn, but he felt a deep empathy in his heart.

Ning Zhuo's pressure was far greater than he outwardly showed.

His various detection spells yielded no results, but his wisdom had already told him that he was undoubtedly under heavy surveillance.

Especially among them, there was a renowned divine constable!

Every move he made, every word he spoke, had to be flawless, without the slightest flaw.

Otherwise, the consequences would be unimaginable!

Fei Si's letter was delivered in the evening.

Ning Zhuo looked at the jade slip letter, hesitating for a long time, his expression constantly changing.

There was solemnity, fear, and a bit of resentment.

It seemed he was blaming Fei Si; if it weren't for him, Ning Zhuo wouldn't be in this situation.

Ning Zhuo finally sighed, gritted his teeth, and suddenly reached out to take the jade slip.

He pressed the jade slip against his forehead, continuously infusing it with his divine sense.

After reading the letter's content, he sighed deeply again, his face full of worry, and placed the jade slip on the table.

He began pacing back and forth in front of the table again, hands behind his back.

After a while, Ning Zhuo took out a blank jade slip and started writing a letter with his magical power.

He wrote to Ning Jiufan again, informing him that Fei Si had sent him a letter, asking about the details of the day's events.

Ning Zhuo didn't know what to do, so he wrote to seek advice.

Ning Jiufan quickly received the letter.

To be precise, he had already seen Ning Zhuo writing the letter and had guessed its content.

After receiving the letter, he infused his divine sense into it, and with just one glance, he understood that his guess was correct.

Ning Jiufan didn't dare to make a decision on his own and handed the letter to Zhu Xuanji and the other Golden Core Patriarchs.

Ning Zhuo was merely a junior at the Qi Refining Stage, yet his letter was reviewed by six Golden Core cultivators one after another, showing unprecedented importance.

After reading the letter, everyone focused their attention on Zhu Xuanji.

Zhu Xuanji smiled slightly, "Ning Zhuo, this poor little guy, is already at his wit's end."

"Let him reply, just as he normally would."

"Since Fei Si is suspicious and wants to delve into why I visited Ning Zhuo today, let Ning Zhuo tell the truth. It will continue to stir the grass and startle the snake!"

Zhu Xuanji needed the City Lord's Mansion to make a mistake, preferably sending assassins to kill Ning Zhuo, so he could catch them red-handed.

Fei Si's initiative to write a letter made Zhu Xuanji a bit worried.

He feared that Ning Zhuo might reveal a flaw, and facing an old fox like Fei Si, it would be easy to be seen through!

So, he decided to let Ning Zhuo tell the truth.

After all, his previous conversation with Ning Zhuo was deliberately designed.

At that time, on his way to Ning Zhuo, Zhu Xuanji had already set his goal to make the City Lord's Mansion feel his pressure.

In the bedroom, Ning Zhuo had already lain down.

He tossed and turned on the bed, unable to sleep.

Suddenly, he received a secret transmission from Ning Jiufan.

Ning Zhuo opened his eyes abruptly, unable to hide his excitement, and then he was immediately instructed by Ning Jiufan to act as usual.

Ning Zhuo went to the study, sat at the desk, and began writing a letter with the jade slip.

Following Ning Jiufan's instructions, he truthfully wrote down his detailed conversation with Zhu Xuanji.

Overall, the letter had two main points: Yuan Dasheng and the Demonic Dao Scripture.

At the end of the letter, Ning Zhuo deliberately asked Fei Si: What did he know about the Demonic Dao Scripture?

From early morning, Fei Si sat at his desk, handling various affairs of the Immortal City.

His buttocks hardly left the seat.

It wasn't until the crescent moon rose that he finally finished most of the affairs.

Of course, by tomorrow, or even tonight, new affairs would arise.

The recruitment order had brought too many outsiders into Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

This brought immense pressure to the City Lord's Mansion in managing the Immortal City.

If it weren't for Fei Si and Tui Han working tirelessly, the city would have already fallen into chaos.

Fei Si was very concerned about Zhu Xuanji's actions!

On one hand, Zhu Xuanji was a member of the royal family.

It was now confirmed that he was the biggest competitor in the City Lord's Mansion's decision regarding the Lava Immortal Palace.

On the other hand, Zhu Xuanji's high-profile visit to Ning Zhuo, with such a grand entrance, clearly indicated something important had happened.

Almost everyone in Fire Persimmon Immortal City was talking about this.

As the acting City Lord, Fei Si naturally wanted to understand the real details.

Considering his close relationship with Ning Zhuo in private, he simply wrote a jade slip letter to directly inquire about Ning Zhuo.

"Finally, a reply." Fei Si took the jade slip written by Ning Zhuo and infused his divine sense.

After reading it, Fei Si's expression changed slightly.

"Demonic Dao Scripture? What kind of name is that?"

"How would I know about any True Scripture, and you still come to ask me?" Fei Si put down the jade slip, frowning slightly, his mind racing.

"Is the Demonic Dao Scripture a technique of the Three Sects?"

Fei Si thought of the Three Sects' techniques, remembered his conversation with Meng Kui, and the City Lord's Mansion's speculation about the Three Dantian Foundation Establishment technique.

"If this True Scripture is indeed one of the techniques related to the Three Dantian Foundation Establishment, and it complements the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique..."

"Then obtaining this True Scripture would indeed be of great help in exploring the Immortal Palace and seizing the position of the Immortal Palace's master."

"No wonder Zhu Xuanji rushed over so urgently, clearly pressuring Ning Zhuo to hand over the Demonic Dao Scripture!"

"But how did Zhu Xuanji know? Where did he get the clue about the Demonic Dao Scripture?"

Since Zhu Xuanji entered Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Fei Si had been closely monitoring his every move.

After all, Fei Si was the strategist of the City Lord's Mansion, and Zhu Xuanji came from the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family, sent as an envoy.

Because Fei Si had been secretly monitoring, he was very curious about where Zhu Xuanji got his clue.

"Recently, Zhu Xuanji led the Golden Core cultivators of the three families, openly exploring the depths of the volcano."

"Could it be that they obtained clues about the True Scripture at the bottom of Fire Persimmon Mountain?"

With this question in mind, Fei Si went to the top of the volcano to seek an audience with Meng Kui.

He asked Meng Kui, who had been stationed at the top of Fire Persimmon Mountain, about Zhu Xuanji and the others' movements.

Meng Kui knew a little and immediately told Fei Si about the matter of the Mechanical General.

Fei Si was amazed, "This time, Ning Xiangguo's sacrifice is truly great!"
