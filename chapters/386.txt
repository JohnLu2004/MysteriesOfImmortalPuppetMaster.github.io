Chapter 386: Meditative Brew

Sunlight filtered softly through the dense foliage, casting dappled shadows on the mountain path.

Ning Zhuo carried a wine jug, walking at a leisurely pace, brushing past branches as he went.

Birds chirped in the forest, their clear songs pleasant to the ear. The air was fresh, mixed with the fragrance of soil and vegetation.

"I've come to this place again," Ning Zhuo said as he reached a deep pool, the place where he first met Lin Shanshan.

The pool water was crystal clear, with fish swimming in it. Suddenly, one leapt out of the water, creating ripples that shattered the golden sunlight on the surface.

Ning Zhuo continued on, circling to the mountain path behind the waterfall.

To his left, the waterfall roared, water splashing everywhere, sunlight reflecting off it to create a rainbow across the sky. To his right, the mountain wall was covered in moss, silent and deep.

The contrast between movement and stillness created a beautiful harmony of yin and yang.

After walking along the mountain path, Ning Zhuo stopped in front of the Ten Thousand Beasts Cave.

He didn't enter directly, but instead used his magical powers to create a flying message on a talisman paper.

The message floated gently into the cave.

Soon after, Linghu Jiu emerged from the cave holding the flying message, a smile on his face, coming to greet him personally.

At this moment, the two finally met face to face for the first time.

Linghu Jiu was tall and thin, dressed in a blue robe with wide sleeves that fluttered in the wind, exuding the air of a wine immortal.

Ning Zhuo wore a white robe with wide sleeves, his eyes as clear as water, his face like a spring breeze, as radiant as the morning sun, refined and polite, immediately inspiring goodwill in others.

Upon seeing Linghu Jiu, Ning Zhuo thought to himself: "What an extraordinary person indeed!"

Recalling the intelligence reports and how Linghu Jiu had sent him the Golden and Fire Enlightenment Diagrams, Ning Zhuo felt increasingly that Linghu Jiu was no ordinary person.

"Today's meeting, I must get a clearer understanding of this person."

Linghu Jiu had a high reputation in the Myriad Medicine Sect, his position unshakeable, surely a core figure of power in the sect, perhaps even the next sect leader.

Linghu Jiu silently marveled: "What a fine young man! Handsome and talented, truly a gentleman of this turbid world."

"Though favored by his family elders, his attire is simple and modest."

Before meeting, Ning Zhuo had many speculations about Linghu Jiu. At first glance, he found Linghu Jiu's demeanor exceptional, confirming his guesses.

Linghu Jiu likewise had many guesses about Ning Zhuo, and at first glance, found Ning Zhuo's appearance even more impressive than he had imagined. His simple and clean attire made him feel favorably disposed.

Both had been looking forward to meeting the other, and at first sight, both felt goodwill towards each other.

Linghu Jiu smiled and said, "Young Master Ning, our sect has already received a flying message about your arrival. I've heard that you've been winning consecutive victories on Small Contest Peak recently, your fame unmatched. Even I, secluded in this deep cave, have heard of it. Please, come in quickly!"

Ning Zhuo first set down the wine jug he was carrying, using his magical powers to keep it floating in mid-air. He clasped his hands in greeting and said seriously, "I've long heard of Brother Linghu's great reputation. It's truly my good fortune to meet you today. I've come uninvited today, bringing a humble jug of wine. I hope you won't refuse it."

Linghu Jiu sniffed, his eyes fixed on the floating wine jug. He laughed heartily and made a welcoming gesture: "Young Master Ning's generous gift, I humbly accept. Please, come inside and allow me to be a proper host."

The two entered the cave.

The cave's furnishings were simple: a stone table, stone chairs, and a stone bed.

Linghu Jiu invited Ning Zhuo to sit down: "This mountain cave is crude, I'm afraid it's a poor reception for such an honored guest."

But Ning Zhuo said, "The mountain scenery is uniquely beautiful, ancient and serene. Moreover, to be able to drink with Brother Linghu today must surely be one of life's great pleasures."

Linghu Jiu took out stone bowls, looking expectantly at the wine jug.

His nostrils flared again: "To be honest with Young Master Ning, I have a nose for wine, skilled at smelling wine's fragrance. Just from this wine's aroma, I can tell it's no ordinary drink. It's already stirred my heart!"

Ning Zhuo smiled slightly.

According to the intelligence reports, Linghu Jiu's love for wine had been heavily emphasized.

But after meeting him, Ning Zhuo realized that Linghu Jiu's passion for wine was even stronger than what had been described in the reports.

Ning Zhuo poured the wine while introducing its origins.

This was Ice Jade Wine.

Produced from the Ice Heart Jade Gourd, it was a treasure passed down in the Ning family. Those who practiced the Ice Heart Technique would benefit greatly from drinking this wine.

Ning Zhuo first filled Linghu Jiu's stone bowl, then poured some into his own crystal cup.

Ning Zhuo raised his crystal cup with both hands: "In visiting today, I must first thank Brother Linghu. Previously, when Lao De and others misunderstood me, it was all thanks to Brother Linghu's intervention that resolved my difficulties."

"Lin Shanshan is pure-hearted and hospitable, helping me many times, even to the point of being confined."

"The kindness of a friend weighs heavily on my heart, and I will surely repay it generously in the future!"

Linghu Jiu stared at Ning Zhuo with drunk eyes, his breath heavy with alcohol.

Yet at this moment, Ning Zhuo felt as if Linghu Jiu could see right through to the bottom of his heart, leaving nothing hidden.

Linghu Jiu pointed at Ning Zhuo: "Good lad, those are truly heartfelt words!"

"Hehe."

"Hahaha!"

He threw back his head and laughed, his eyes growing moist. Disregarding his image, he wiped away a tear in front of Ning Zhuo.

Linghu Jiu's emotions were complex and hard to express.

On one hand, he felt relieved. The junior sister he cared for had not been pursued by an outsider.

On the other hand, he felt a bit disappointed and wronged. The junior sister he cared for had given so much, yet still hadn't caught the eye of this outsider!

Seeing Ning Zhuo silent and confused, Linghu Jiu sighed deeply: "My apologies, Young Master Ning. I have a special talent called 'Drunken Moon Seeking Immortals.'"

"As long as I drink heavily and enter a drunken state, my thoughts become clear, inspiration flows endlessly, and I can see through worldly affairs with piercing insight."

"Just now when I asked that question, I used this talent and knew that you spoke the truth."

"To be honest, it wasn't just Lao De and the others who misunderstood you, even I misunderstood you!"

Ning Zhuo smiled slightly: "'Drunken Moon Seeking Immortals'?"

"In any case, being able to clear up this misunderstanding is a great fortune for me."

"Brother Linghu, there's no need to apologize. On the contrary, I should thank you."

Saying this, he raised his wine cup.

Linghu Jiu also picked up his wine bowl, and they clinked their vessels together, both drinking in one gulp.

Linghu Jiu looked Ning Zhuo up and down, suddenly sighing: "Now I know why my little junior sister favors you."

He pointed at Ning Zhuo: "My junior sister respects my master the most, who is also her father, the leader of our sect."

"Your manner, so proper and upright, is very much like my master."

Ning Zhuo hurriedly expressed humility, saying he didn't have the qualifications to be compared to a great Nascent Soul cultivator like Lin Bufan.

Linghu Jiu suddenly stood up: "Wait a moment, let's not rush to finish the Ice Jade Wine. I'd like to treat you to a drink as well."

He took a few large steps to the stone bed.

He felt around the edge of the bed and pulled out a jug of wine.

Linghu Jiu returned to his seat, placed the wine on the stone table, and couldn't help but boast proudly: "I've been confined here many times, so I had someone set up a secret storage formation here to hide some good wine."

"Whenever I feel lonely and unbearably thirsty, I take out a jug to quench my thirst."

"This wine is called 'Meditative Brew,' and it will be quite useful for you, Young Master Ning."

Linghu Jiu picked up the wine jug and poured some for Ning Zhuo.

He introduced it: "The main ingredients of this wine are water from the Yellow Springs and night-wandering grass, with supporting ingredients of moon dew, netherworld jade, and nine-tailed fox tears."

"After drinking it, one's thoughts can extend down to the netherworld, gaining insights from the wisdom of ancestors and receiving guidance from the unseen realm."

Linghu Jiu sighed and continued: "Because of my 'Drunken Moon Seeking Immortals' talent, my master specially invited a spirit chef to brew this wine for me. My cultivation has benefited greatly from this wine."

Ning Zhuo's curiosity was already greatly aroused. He solemnly picked up the wine cup and examined it carefully.

He saw that the Meditative Brew was deep blue in color, with tiny specks of light flickering within.

Bringing it close to his nose for a careful sniff, the wine's fragrance was so faint as to be almost nonexistent, but it immediately made Ning Zhuo's mind clear and peaceful.

"Boss, I'm going to drink it," Ning Zhuo transmitted mentally.

Inside the Mechanical Dragon, Sun Lingtong swallowed hard: "You brat, eating and drinking well out there while I have to look after you. Remember to save some for me."

Ning Zhuo calmed his mind and took a small sip.

As the wine slid over his tongue, its sweetness was mixed with a hint of bitterness, like the ups and downs of life.

After the wine entered his stomach, a warm feeling spread from within, outward. The mysterious power of the spirit wine flowed through his body, bringing an unprecedented sense of tranquility and serenity.

In an instant, Ning Zhuo "saw" a person.

"Behold, I am the Five Elements Divine Lord! The mysteries of the Five Elements are all in my hands. The Five Spirits and Five Gods obey my commands and dare not disobey!"

"Little descendant, do you want to learn my Five Organs Temple Divine Art?"

"Hahaha, listen well!"

"The Five Elements are Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth; the Five Organs are Heart, Liver, Spleen, Lung, and Kidney. The Five Elements correspond to the Five Organs, each with its own function, generating and restraining each other in an endless cycle..."

Ning Zhuo concentrated intently, listening carefully.

However, the Five Elements Divine Lord's words grew fainter and fainter, and finally even his figure disappeared.

"What's going on?" Ning Zhuo's eyes snapped open.

The wine's effect had worn off.

Ning Zhuo felt a sense of loss.

Linghu Jiu laughed heartily: "It seems Young Master Ning has experienced the benefits of this wine."

Ning Zhuo, without any courtesy, eagerly said: "Please, pour more wine."

After drinking another cup, he once again saw the Five Elements Divine Lord with his ancient appearance and divine aura.

The Divine Lord continued to recite his Five Organs Temple Divine Art.

This time, after speaking a small portion, he disappeared again.

Ning Zhuo's eyes opened: "More, I need more."

Linghu Jiu laughed loudly.

Ning Zhuo directly took away his own crystal cup and looked at Linghu Jiu: "Elder Brother, do you have a bowl?"
