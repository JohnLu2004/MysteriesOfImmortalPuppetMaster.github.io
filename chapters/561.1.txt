Apology!

A sincere apology to everyone!

Looking back at March, I only released two new chapters, totaling just over 10,000 words, while taking multiple leaves of absence - this is truly inexcusable.

Plans are always beautiful, but executing them often turns into a mess.

Most importantly, I feel deeply ashamed for failing to meet everyone's expectations - this is entirely my fault!

One person's time and energy are very limited. I need to study and seek advice in multiple ways to find a sustainable approach to fulfilling my commitments. Fortunately, I have recently made some promising progress!

The ten-year commitment I proposed will not be abandoned - I will remain steadfast throughout these ten years.

Those familiar with my work know that the update frequency of "Mysteries of Immortal Puppet Master" far exceeds that of "Reverend Insanity" and "Infinite Blood Core". Maintaining a steady update volume has always been a challenge for me, especially as an author who follows a strict outline-driven approach.

Since I started updating in April last year, I've had to work late into the night, with most of my bedtimes falling between 2 to 3 AM.

Over the past year, through learning and seeking advice, I've come to understand the difficulties ahead. The ten-year commitment I made with everyone is an arduous and challenging journey. While I have made some progress, it's only the first step - a mere starting point.

Regardless of what the final outcome of these ten years may be, at the very least, I can say to myself: I have never slacked off or given up. I have been pushing myself to my limits and striving with all my strength.

I am only human-flesh and blood. I get tired, I feel pain, and I need time to adjust and adapt. Please allow me some time to readjust and regain my footing.

That said, underperforming is still underperforming. I take full responsibility, and I sincerely apologize to all my supportive readers!

In April, I will join the reader community to personally apologize and engage in direct discussions. I will listen to your criticisms and suggestions!

I am truly sorry, everyone!
