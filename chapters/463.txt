Chapter 463: Mu Lan vs Zhang Hei

Mu Lan’s face was as calm as still water.

Zhang Hei roared at the gate of the Red Flower Battalion’s camp, his voice booming like thunder, causing a very large negative impact on the army.

However, Mu Lan still suppressed her anger: “General Zhang, be quiet for now. I still do not know what happened. Let me inquire first!”

Mu Lan questioned the soldiers involved in the brawl. The soldiers responded truthfully, feeling aggrieved.

Zhang Hei forced down his anger, waving his hand repeatedly: “Ask, go ahead and ask!”

“They insulted Old General Mu, saying our Red Flower Battalion specializes in shirking responsibility onto our comrades, acting worse than animals!”

“It was the people of the Third General Battalion who provoked us first!”

“We did not make the first move. It was the people of the Third General Battalion who spat and slept right on our faces.”

Mu Lan nodded and responded to Zhang Hei right on the spot: “General Zhang, the course of events is now clear. Since it was your side that initiated the provocation, why not summon the parties involved so we may confront them face-to-face.”

Zhang Hei was furious. Holding his Black Serpent Spear, he once again pointed its tip at Mu Lan: “My soldier is already lying in bed, Life Hanging by a Thread, currently receiving treatment.”

“Do you truly want him to come confront you? Or have you seen through this and are using words to force me?!”

“I came to seek justice, and it seems the only way to achieve it is through fists!”

Mu Lan’s face remained as calm as still water. Anger pushed her to a mocking smile: “You black scoundrel, just promoted and already so full of yourself? Since you keep using insolent words and truly seek a beating, let me fulfill your wish!”

Zhang Hei laughed loudly, mobilizing his magic power, and was the first to soar into the sky.

Mu Lan also immediately took to the air and drew out a long spear from her storage ring.

The Blood-Tasseled Spear!

Its total length was about seven feet, with an excellent grip and a design perfectly balanced. It was suitable for swift assassinations and could also unleash extremely fierce sweeping strikes.

The shaft was made of wax-white wood, as tough as iron, with a smooth surface and a faint yellowish hue that exuded an ancient, rustic aura.

The spearhead was sharp and slightly curved, gleaming with a cold light.

The most striking feature was none other than the red tassel at the top of the spear. The red strands at the end of the tassel were as bright as fresh blood, swaying in the wind like a flowing river of blood. The crimson tassel formed a sharp contrast with the pure white spear shaft.

Zhang Hei, on the other hand, held his Black Serpent Spear and charged straight upward.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

Spear and lance clashed, bursting forth dazzling sparks.

The violent collisions were piercingly loud, echoing throughout the military camp.

The commotion caused by Zhang Hei was quite large. The entire Red Flower Battalion was alarmed. Almost all the officers and soldiers looked up to the sky to watch the battle.

“That Zhang Hei is too arrogant!”

“The reason their Third General Battalion could capture Ma Fei-Tui alive was all thanks to our Red Flower Battalion weakening him beforehand!”

Zhang Hei and Mu Lan fought in close combat, crossing blows up and down in midair.

“What’s there for them to be so proud of!”

“General Mu, please teach that black scoundrel a good lesson!”

The soldiers of the Red Flower Battalion were full of confidence in General Mu Lan.

Zhang Hei’s Black Serpent Spear was heavy and overbearing. His moves were rough and straightforward; each strike brought a howling gust of wind and impressive momentum.

Mu Lan’s Blood-Tasseled Spear was as swift as a crimson lightning bolt, focused mainly on thrusting. The technique she cultivated was the Profound Gold Armor-Piercing Art, renowned for its ability to penetrate armor.

Mu Lan’s spear techniques were swift and fierce. Each thrust of the spearhead left behind stunning arcs of blood-colored radiance in the eyes of the observers.

Her movements were plain and unadorned, far less flamboyant or wild than Zhang Hei’s. Yet every motion was extremely precise, forcing Zhang Hei to dodge and evade.

Mu Lan spun around, her cape whipping through the air and creating a swirl of light and shadow.

“Whoosh!”

The light and shadow veiled Zhang Hei’s eyes, blinding him.

Taking advantage of the moment, Mu Lan thrust out the Blood-Tasseled Spear. The spearhead pierced through the chilly air, aiming at Zhang Hei’s right arm.

At this critical juncture, Zhang Hei relied on hearing the wind to determine position. He retreated explosively while using the Black Serpent Spear horizontally as a block.

A dull thud sounded as the Black Serpent Spear was shaken off course.

Zhang Hei’s figure wavered, revealing even more openings.

Mu Lan seized the opportunity and attacked again swiftly. The spearhead stabbed forth like lightning, this time aiming directly at Zhang Hei’s neck.

Zhang Hei backed up once more. The muscles in his right arm bulged as he forcibly retracted the Black Serpent Spear, barely managing to use its tip to block Mu Lan’s spear.

He caught his breath, then gripped the Serpent Spear with his left hand as well, exerting force with both arms.

“Hah!”

He forcefully shoved, pushing aside Mu Lan’s Blood-Tasseled Spear.

Mu Lan’s figure was as agile as the wind, her posture light. She sidestepped to the left, and once again, with blinding speed, slanted her Blood-Tasseled Spear toward Zhang Hei’s abdomen.

Zhang Hei let out a muffled grunt. This time he truly failed to defend in time, and his abdomen was drilled through with a bloody hole.

He clenched his teeth and endured it, bringing the spearhead down from above to smash viciously toward Mu Lan’s head, a stance ready to trade life for life.

Mu Lan wore no helmet and refused to risk her life recklessly, so she was forced to withdraw.

Zhang Hei barely stabilized his footing, showing not the slightest fear. The fighting spirit in his heart surged even stronger due to his rage.

A sharp glint flashed in Mu Lan’s eyes, and a trace of admiration rose in her heart: “He is indeed a valiant general.”

“Come again!” He brandished the Serpent Spear and took the initiative to charge.

She kept thrusting her Blood-Tasseled Spear, occasionally sweeping it horizontally, forming a rain of spear strikes that enveloped Zhang Hei.

Zhang Hei, like a trapped wild beast, continued to roar and fight desperately. However, the wounds on his body increased in number, and blood began to flow profusely.

Mu Lan held a clear advantage in her duel against Zhang Hei!

Yet as the battle continued, Zhang Hei’s power grew rapidly.

His eyes were filled with anger. Wielding the Black Serpent Spear, he created a series of black shadows, astonishingly swift.

Black shadows surged like waves, raging and tumultuous.

Black Overwhelming Waves Technique!

Zhang Hei’s technique gradually took effect. With simple attacks, he could produce a vast expanse of black waves, inflicting damage over a certain area.

Meanwhile, his entire body seemed to fill with vigor. His sinews bulged like coiled flood dragons around his torso, granting him even greater strength.

He possessed a natural talent —Mad Python Sinews!

This innate ability allowed a cultivator’s sinews and membranes to swell and condense into python-like cables whenever the cultivator fell into anger, granting terrifying strength.

The more furious the cultivator became, the stronger their underlying potential, and the more astonishing the power bestowed by the Mad Python Sinews.

Clang!

Yet another clash of the Blood-Tasseled Spear and the Black Serpent Spear.

But this time, the Blood-Tasseled Spear was knocked aside, and the Black Serpent Spear continued forward!

A fierce gleam flickered in Mu Lan’s eyes. Realizing the danger, she began attacking with all her might.

Zhang Hei’s arms were swollen like mountains. The python-like sinews coiled around his entire body, unleashing a force as overwhelming as a sudden flood bursting forth.

Black Overwhelming Waves Technique!

Mad Python Sinews!

Black Serpent Spear!

These three combined so that each of his attacks stirred up surging black waves. Within these black waves, the Serpent Spear was like a flood dragon rampaging through the sea, incomparably ferocious.

And as Zhang Hei fought, his strength grew greater and greater, rendering the Black Serpent Spear even heavier and more overbearing.

The shaft swept across like rolling giant waves, powerful enough to destroy any enemy blocking its way!

Mu Lan, nimble as the wind, gradually felt like a red bird overlooking a black sea, facing a sense of helplessness.

“This can’t go on! That black scoundrel…”

Mu Lan would never admit defeat, especially not in front of her own troops.

She snorted coldly, pulled away, and flew rapidly to widen the distance.

Zhang Hei was momentarily stunned, recalling Mu Lan’s archery skills, and immediately pursued.

But his speed could not compare to Mu Lan’s, who easily stayed far out of his reach.

Mu Lan drew out her treasured weapon, the Vermilion Phoenix Bow, and fitted a Fiery Heart Arrow.

She then activated her divine ability, the Crimson Heart Hawk Arrow!

Zhang Hei’s scalp went numb, sensing that he was firmly locked onto, unable to escape no matter where he fled—be it heaven or earth.

“So this is how that Temple Priest at Dragon King’s Shrine felt back then.”

“So terrifying!”

“I’m going to die!” Zhang Hei’s eyes widened desperately. Even facing death, he refused to look away!

The next moment.

Poof.
