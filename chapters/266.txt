Chapter 266: I Want to Ignite This Fire with My Own Hands!

On the stage, the sound of creaking echoed as the background buildings slowly collapsed, transitioning to the next scene. The audience remained silent, fully immersed in the performance. Only a few musicians, while playing their instruments, couldn't help but glance at the highest level of the stage where Ning Zhuo stood. They were astonished by this young cultivator's skillful manipulation, almost indistinguishable from Li Leifeng when he was alive.

Ning Zhuo's eyes sparkled, and sweat covered his entire body. Taking advantage of the transition between scenes, he communicated with the dragon turtle fire spirit through the Life-Hanging Thread: "Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit! I'm outside the Immortal Palace, and influencing Ning Xiaohui to this extent through the Life-Hanging Thread is my limit. From here on, it's up to you!"

The dragon turtle fire spirit roared anxiously: "No, Young Master Ning Zhuo. My authority is restricted, I can't..."

Before it could finish, Ning Zhuo interrupted: "Sorry, the next scene is about to start. I'm barely holding on myself. You must win over there at the Immortal Palace!"

The dragon turtle fire spirit: ...

……

The stage was set up as the residence of a powerful minister, with dim lighting. The sound of the jinghu was continuous and low. The minister puppet lay on the bed, listening quietly to the black-clad messenger puppet's report.

The black-clad messenger sang: "My lord, I have persuaded the commoner to falsely accuse the judge. Tomorrow, he will be publicly accused, bringing great shame. The judge is upright and will not tolerate this. Kill the commoner, and he will fall into the trap."

The minister puppet, dressed in official robes, lay on the bed with his legs crossed, his head slightly turning, vividly lifelike. He sang triumphantly: "Well done, excellently done. Tomorrow's situation is set. The judge has fallen into the trap and will find it hard to defend himself. His righteous reputation will be ruined in an instant. Let's see how he stands in court again! Hahaha." The minister laughed.

The lights dimmed, and the jinghu turned high-pitched. The stage creaked again as the scene changed, and Ning Zhuo took a deep breath, his eyes flickering.

The third act ended, and the fourth act began. The stage returned to the courtroom, brightly lit. The jinghu was urgent, and drums and gongs resounded.

The judge puppet sat in the official's seat, striking the gavel, and sang: "Today, we re-examine, the mirror before the court. Who is the real culprit, let it be clearly stated." The criminal puppet knelt below, raising his head several times, each time accompanied by a drumbeat.

Finally, he mustered the courage, shouted excitedly, and sang: "Judge, you false judge, greedy and corrupt, harming the people. The so-called real culprit is you, killing me to silence, your crime is immense!"

Clang, clang, clang! The sound of gongs tugged at the audience's heartstrings.

The judge puppet stood up in shock. The jinghu turned sharply, and the judge suppressed his anger, singing: "Shameless scoundrel, daring to falsely accuse! Audacious, recklessly framing!" He took a deep breath: "If I were to exercise my power today, it would be easy to execute you, but I am unwilling.

"Justice must be served through trial, I shall first examine myself!"

Immediately, the judge sat down slowly, playing both roles, ultimately declaring himself suspicious and temporarily imprisoning himself.

"My lord!" The constables in the court exclaimed at such a verdict.

"My lord!" The puppet citizens outside the court exclaimed.

The judge bound his hands, held his head high, and led the constables away.

The lights dimmed, leaving only the criminal puppet in a spotlight.

"My lord..." The criminal puppet lamented, crying with tears streaming down his face.

Ning Xiaohui was on the verge of tears!

She ran frantically on the chaotic battlefield, using every means at her disposal to fight for her life!

"Save me!"

"Can anyone save me!!"

She kept calling for help, screaming desperately.

Several times, she was on the brink of life and death. Her innate Ice Jade Hand still performed admirably at this moment, allowing Ning Xiaohui to survive.

The attention of the golden core cultivators was no longer on her.

Because a massive wave of Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts was about to overwhelm the Historical Records Pavilion!

The three golden core cultivators, along with Zhu Zhen, had been solemnly instructed by Zhu Xuanji beforehand—the Historical Records Pavilion was extremely important and must not be lost!

Compared to the Historical Records Pavilion, Ning Xiaohui was not as important. Especially since Ning Xiaohui had told the Moon Hook Avatar that she hadn't had time to browse the materials in the Historical Records Pavilion.

Boom, boom, boom!

Golden core-level spells continuously bombarded, tearing the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts apart, leaving them dead and unable to rise.

But there were too many Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts, endlessly replenishing, like an unending tide.

"Damn it, we have to protect the Historical Records Pavilion, but we're tied down! We can't exert our full strength!" "We must quickly seal the breach in the spherical barrier, or the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts will never stop." "Damn, the hole in the barrier seems to be getting bigger!" The golden core cultivators communicated with each other.

Thanks to their efforts to protect the Historical Records Pavilion, Yang Chanyu also survived by luck.

She shrank to the side, fully focused on removing the marks others had planted on her.

The dragon turtle fire spirit couldn't directly harm Ning Xiaohui, so it commanded the mechanical constructs to drive the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts towards Ning Xiaohui as much as possible.

But the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts were unruly, often choosing to fight the puppet army to the death, making it difficult to drive them.

In the face of life and death, Ning Xiaohui unleashed her full potential.

She charged into a weak spot.

Turning a corner, suddenly, her vision opened up, and she arrived at the Gourd Furnace Forest.

This wasn't Ning Xiaohui's first time here; she had completed many artifact refining tasks here before.

The familiar scene gave Ning Xiaohui a sense of safety.

A Foundation Establishment Scarlet Flame Demon Beast spotted her and lunged at her.

Ning Xiaohui fled swiftly.

She instinctively entered the furnace forest, and seeing the Scarlet Flame Demon Beast about to catch up, in desperation, she chose a silver furnace, opened the door, and jumped inside!

Bang, bang, bang...

The Scarlet Flame Demon Beast attacked the furnace madly from outside.

Ning Xiaohui held the furnace door tightly and used her Ice Jade Hand to create ice blocks, sealing the door's gaps and reinforcing it strongly.

Ning Xiaohui was on edge for a while until the Scarlet Flame Demon Beast gave up and left, allowing her to relax.

"Ugh..."

She sat down, overwhelmed by the joy of survival, fear, and other emotions, causing her to cover her face and cry.

The criminal puppet was also crying.

On the stage, the fifth act had already begun.

The judge’s choices and actions completely moved the criminal puppet.

Both were imprisoned, separated by a corridor.

The criminal confessed, revealing the entire truth to the judge, exposing the treacherous minister, and expressing his willingness to confess and accept punishment.

The judge sighed deeply and sang: "A prodigal son returns, worth more than gold, recognizing oneself, a pure heart untroubled." "You have confessed, sincerely repented, this world will surely embrace you."

"Do not lose your true self, regroup, walk the righteous path, your life has been renewed!" Ning Zhuo was touched to the core!

He understood Zhu Xuanji's intention.

Zhu Xuanji advised him to surrender and walk the righteous path.

"Can I really walk this path?" Ning Zhuo asked himself.

His eyes flickered, showing hesitation.

The puppet show continued.

The puppet citizens gathered, waving flags and shouting, pleading for the judge.

The puppet playing the deity was also moved, descending voluntarily to meet the king.

The matter escalated, known throughout the nation, and the king decided to personally adjudicate the case.

The treacherous minister, upon learning this, immediately sent a black-clad messenger to kill the criminal in prison, leaving no evidence!

The minister also actively fabricated charges, fully framing the judge.

The sixth act began.

In the Golden Luan Hall, the judge and the minister confronted each other.

The minister was well-prepared, and the judge was at a disadvantage.

The king, already prepared, clapped his hands and summoned the Pure Flame.

This was one of the seven great flames, capable of burning away falsehoods and discerning truth to some extent.

The king sang: "You two are in dispute, let the fire judge. Who is true, who is false, will be clear."

The minister hesitated, singing: "Proving oneself in fire is perilous. Rumors may not be accurate..."

Unexpectedly, the judge leaped into the fire.

At this point, the opera reached its climax!

The jinghu turned sharply, drums thundered, and the audience held their breath.

On the stage, the white flame with a clear light enveloped the judge puppet, burning fiercely.

Such a special flame made the judge extremely prominent and eye-catching.

At this moment, he was the sole protagonist on the stage.

The judge sang loudly in the fire!

"If I am to clear this injustice, let the fierce flames sever falsehoods." "My heart is open, without shame to heaven and earth, unafraid of life and death, unafraid of fire's blaze!" "This is—"

"This heart is open to the sun and moon," "I'd rather be pure and white, even if it costs a meal."

"Life and death are but fleeting matters," "The original intention remains unchanged for all eternity!"

On the stage, the flames blazed.

The blue-white flames illuminated Ning Zhuo's face, and for a moment, he was somewhat entranced.

In the Lava Immortal Palace, within the main hall.

The dragon turtle fire spirit's massive body pressed against the door and ceiling, its firelight illuminating every corner of the main hall.

It roared, it shouted, it called out to Ning Zhuo: "Young Master! Young Master!!"

On the battlefield surrounding the Historical Records Pavilion.

The firelight from the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts reflected on the golden core cultivators.

The chaotic battle continued.

The golden core cultivators formed a tight defensive line, and the battle reached a stalemate.

Zhu Xuanji stood by the window, overlooking Ning Zhuo on the stage.

"Ning Zhuo, don't disappoint me!" The golden light in his eyes represented his expectations.

Ning Zhuo's eyes flickered, and he couldn't help but think—perhaps he could also cleanse his sins in this Pure Flame!

He wouldn't need to hide or bear such a heavy burden; he could walk proudly in the light. He would walk with ease.

He sat on the high platform, looking at the audience below, seeing everything clearly.

"Is this the perspective of the late Li Leifeng? No wonder he could discover the young me." "Now, I have also reached this position."

"Perhaps, I can stay here, in this bright and beautiful place..."

"Hmm?"

Ning Zhuo's expression changed slightly, and in a trance, he saw his former self.

As if crossing over a decade of time, the current Ning Zhuo saw the past Ning Zhuo.

That small figure hid in a dark corner, drooling over the guests' pastries. Whenever someone glanced over, he would instinctively hunch his shoulders and lower his head. Like, like... a thief.

Ning Zhuo squinted his eyes, looking carefully.

In a trance, the child's face wasn't his but Sun Lingtong's!

A memory surged in his mind.

Ning Zhuo sneaked into the prison and rescued Sun Lingtong.

"Boss, you failed again this time." Ning Zhuo said with a wry smile.

Sun Lingtong chuckled: "Ah, got caught. Thanks, little brother!" Ning Zhuo shook his head: "Why do you always have to steal? We have money now."

Sun Lingtong used his hand as a pillow, swaggering out of the carriage, saying as he walked: "I'm a thief, if I don't steal, what do I do?" Ning Zhuo continued shaking his head, not understanding: "Even if you steal, there's no need to seal your cultivation."

Sun Lingtong said: "Don't you find it thrilling?"

"I'm already at the Foundation Establishment stage, with my true strength, unless it's those at the golden core level, stealing from others is no challenge." "So, I have to seal my cultivation."

"This peaceful life is really hard to bear, I need some challenges to keep me from getting bored!"

At this point, Sun Lingtong stopped, looked at Ning Zhuo, and said seriously: "You understand, right? You're just like me."

Ning Zhuo raised his eyebrows and exclaimed: "How could I?! Such reckless actions are simply foolish." "Ah, you actually called me foolish, boss?!"

Ning Zhuo quickly waved his hand: "I accidentally spoke my mind, ah, no, boss, boss, let me explain!" Sun Lingtong leaped up, shouting: "Take this, you brat!" Another scene from memory surfaced.

Under the moonlight, two youths washed their hands by a small river in the Immortal City.

That was the first time Ning Zhuo took a life.

The blood flowed down the river, quickly diluted, and by the time it reached the stone bridge forty steps away, it was almost invisible.

Sun Lingtong told him: "Every time I go out to steal, I tell myself before the action, this time I might not come back, I might die." "If this is the result of my life's gamble, I accept it." "I'm always ready to accept my death, even in the next second." "This is my resolve!" "What about your resolve?"

The leaves on both sides of the river rustled in the night wind.

The silver-white moonlight reflected on the river, creating ripples like countless tiny diamonds dancing on the water.

The river's shimmering light rippled in Ning Zhuo's eyes.

When he came back to his senses, he was still sitting high on the stage, below were countless cultivators and elites, and the judge puppet was still bathed in the Pure Flame.

Silent tears flowed down Ning Zhuo's cheeks.

"Oh?" Zhu Xuanji keenly noticed this scene, revealing a trace of satisfaction.

"Ning Zhuo! Ning Zhuo!!" The dragon turtle fire spirit roared in Ning Zhuo's ear.

Strangely.

He had completely blocked out this voice just now.

But in fact, he had heard all the dragon turtle fire spirit's roars.

The dragon turtle fire spirit told Ning Zhuo everything happening in the Lava Immortal Palace.

"Brother Sun." Ning Zhuo communicated with Sun Lingtong through the Life-Hanging Thread.

Sun Lingtong was pleasantly surprised: "Little brother, you finally made a move!" "The battlefield situation is like this..." Ning Zhuo interrupted him: "I know." Sun Lingtong: "Shall we act?" Ning Zhuo: "Boss, thank you." Sun Lingtong: "What?"

Ning Zhuo smiled silently: "I mean, let's act." Sun Lingtong's eyes lit up: "Alright!"

Inside the furnace, Ning Xiaohui gradually calmed down.

"I'm not dead, I survived!" "Hehehe, hahaha!"

"The dragon turtle fire spirit ultimately has limitations, it can only use external forces, it can't directly kill me."

"After this, I'll go to the golden core ancestor for help, I'll expose the dragon turtle fire spirit, I'll expose Ning Zhuo!" "I want... what is this?!"

Poof.

A soft sound, and flames suddenly ignited inside the furnace.

Ning Xiaohui's pupils shrank to needlepoints!

She quickly dodged, rushing towards the furnace door.

She pushed with all her might.

The furnace door didn't budge.

Faintly, the chanting of Buddhist scriptures could be heard.

"Who, who is outside?!"

The temperature rose rapidly, the inside of the furnace turning crimson.

"Spare me, spare me, I beg you, spare my life." "I'll give you anything you want!"

"I can't die, I've discovered the truth." "I don't want to die, I really don't want to die!!" Ning Xiaohui wailed in despair, struggling desperately.

She fully activated her innate Ice Jade Hand, creating massive ice blocks inside the furnace, barely holding on.

At the Historical Records Pavilion, the situation reached a critical moment.

The mechanical constructs drove the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts with all their might, forming a frenzy that overwhelmed the golden core cultivators' formation.

The formation shielded the Historical Records Pavilion!

"Young Master Ning Zhuo, now is the time!" The dragon turtle fire spirit roared.

Ning Zhuo's gaze was cold as he performed his duty as the tower master.

The Five Elements Cannon Tower rose again, and after gathering power, it fired a shot, hitting the mountain of demon beasts.

Boom!

The ineffective demon beasts perished, turning to ash in the explosion of the Five Elements Mana-formed cannonball.

The formation shattered.

"We can't hold it anymore!" "We can't hold it!!"

"Retreat quickly."

The golden core cultivators had no choice but to retreat for their safety.

Boom, boom, boom!

Continuous cannon fire covered the formation, covered the Historical Records Pavilion.

The Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts were almost wiped out, and the former site of the Historical Records Pavilion had become ruins.

What historical records?

Not a trace remained!

"I succeeded!!" The dragon turtle fire spirit howled in excitement.

The next moment, a guillotine formed of flames descended from the sky, slicing along its neck, severing its dragon head directly!!

In the Gourd Furnace Forest.

Under the terrifying high temperature, the ice blocks created by the Ice Jade Hand lasted only a dozen breaths.

Ning Xiaohui's body turned to ash in the flames, leaving behind traces of spirituality, like fireflies dancing.

No more Ning family's main bloodline genius, no more Ice Jade Hand.

The entire furnace returned to calm.

The flames, like a serene dancer, gently stretched their soft figure.

The red-orange firelight filled the furnace, exuding a warm and tranquil color.

On the stage, Ning Zhuo's expression also became calm.

The Pure Flame reflected in his eyes, burning away his hesitation, burning away his luck, burning away his fear, burning away his humility.

The opera "Seeking Justice" reached its conclusion.

The judge emerged from the flames, bringing the Pure Flame to the minister.

The minister retreated repeatedly, but was still enveloped by the firelight, turning to ash in an instant.

"I also long to be illuminated by the firelight."

"If one day, I accidentally set myself on fire, ultimately playing with fire and getting burned..."

"Then, I hope this fire is ignited by my own hands!"
