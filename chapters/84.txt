Chapter 84: Something's Wrong, Young Master Meng Chong Has Fainted

Yuan Dasheng let out a low howl. Its feet and hands slammed against the wall, and its scarlet golden body soared into the air like a rising dragon.

After a few leaps, it arrived beneath Meng Chong.

An instant later, its body suddenly spread open like a giant bow being pulled taut, radiating the beauty of vast power.

Its right arm shot forward fiercely. Though clearly a heavy blow, it gave off a graceful and elegant impression, like a white crane spreading its wings.

Then, Dasheng’s palm gently struck. Its five fingers, nimble as when it was alive, quickly grasped with Meng Chong’s puppet head.

A slight twist, a languid turn.

As Yuan Dasheng landed, its toes were the first to reach the ground. Then came its arms, sliding smoothly down its sides like a cloak or a pair of wings. Though seemingly slow, they actually moved with such speed that brilliant red afterimages were left behind.

Strong winds howled in its wake, but the sound of it touching down was nearly silent.

In stark contrast, Meng Chong slammed to the ground with a loud bang that echoed through Room 3.

Yuan Dasheng let out a light breath and glanced at the head it had plucked from Meng Chong’s puppet body. With a flick of its wrist, its palm opened like flowing water.

Meng Chong’s head dropped to the ground like a ball of wood. It rolled a bit from the momentum before coming to a stop.

Even with the limited expressiveness of the puppet’s face, one could still faintly see the wide-eyed expression Meng Chong had at the moment of death.

At the same time, in the City Lord Mansion.

Meng Chong’s eyes suddenly snapped open.

It was as if he had awoken from a nightmare. The feeling of death was vivid and raw, impressing itself deeply on his soul.

“Huff, huff!” He gasped heavily, his whole body drenched in cold sweat.

If Han Ming saw him now, she might not even recognize him. Currently, Meng Chong was all skin and bones, looking like a long-term invalid who couldn’t bear even a day of sunlight. His once-burly frame had withered, his cheekbones jutted out, and his eye sockets were sunken in.

Once, his gaze had been alarmingly sharp. But now, his eyes were dull and lifeless.

“Strong... that mechanical ape was so strong!

“But I won’t lose.

“As long as I go through some special training, I can definitely make a comeback, defeat it, and clear that level!”

Meng Chong had suffered a harsh setback, but he didn’t lose heart.

However, just as he tried to sit up from the bed, that small movement alone made his vision go black. He passed out instantly.

Thud.

He fell back onto the bed.

The servants outside the room had heard noise earlier and knew that Meng Chong’s soul had returned to his body. Hearing this sound now, the servants immediately sensed something was wrong and called out urgently to no avail.

The two servants turned red with anxiety. Full of panic, they conferred briefly before bursting through the door together.

“Young Master Meng Chong!”

“Something’s wrong! Young Master Meng Chong has fainted!!”

With their echoing calls for help, chaos erupted in the City Lord Mansion’s rear courtyard. It was utter pandemonium.

In the underground workshop.

Ning Zhuo’s mouth was slightly open, unable to hide his surprise.

This was beyond his expectations.

It was much better than anticipated!

“Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng’s combat strength is far above Meng Chong’s.

“Judging by this battle, although Meng Chong’s Ferocious Rushing Thunder has improved, he still can’t do anything to Yuan Dasheng.

“The critical point is Meng Chong’s own condition. It seemed like he failed to use Ferocious Rushing Thunder.”

Ning Zhuo speculated that this was due to the soul entering the immortal palace.

Without a physical body, many things became inconvenient.

When Ning Zhuo used the Buddha Heart Demon Seal previously, he had needed to sense it through the Life-Hanging Thread.

Meng Chong was in the same situation.

Activating Ferocious Rushing Thunder constantly drained the three treasures of essence, qi, and spirit. This kind of consumption was already intense, and passing it through the Life-Hanging Thread caused even more loss. After it reached the puppet body, Meng Chong used it too recklessly and too often.

“If the battle was here in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Meng Chong’s Ferocious Rushing Thunder would be much more effective!

“In contrast, Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng is a mechanical construct and thus has the same strength inside and outside the immortal palace.

“Dasheng’s close combat ability is incredibly powerful. Meng Chong is no match in this area.

“Before, Meng Chong could still rely on his immortal talent to hold his ground. But once he lost the ability to use it and Yuan Dasheng got close, he didn’t have a chance.”

Reaching this conclusion, Ning Zhuo once again felt a strong sense of relief.

After analyzing his intel, he had already anticipated Yuan Dasheng’s immense prowess in close combat. That was why, during his confrontation with the ape, he had avoided direct battle and didn’t even try an ambush or a sneak attack.

Facts proved how wise that decision had been.

Had he relied on brute force back then, he would’ve just been offering himself up to Yuan Dasheng on a silver platter.

Ning Zhuo calmed his mind, and his link with Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng gradually strengthened.

After a few breaths, a white teleportation circle formed out of thin air in front of Ning Zhuo, gradually expanding until it spat out Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.

Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng was shorter than Ning Zhuo but far more robust and muscular. Even standing still, its scarlet-golden color and resolute expression made Ning Zhuo truly admire it.

The young man rubbed both hands together. His grin came from the depths of his heart.

He reached out and pinched Yuan Dasheng’s muscles, only to feel a chill. The mechanical Yuan Dasheng’s fur was extremely soft, while its exposed golden bones were incredibly hard.

Ning Zhuo’s puppet body hadn’t been able to feel these things.

After checking it thoroughly, Ning Zhuo found that Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng had gained a few minor injuries.

These were left by Meng Chong.

“The Lava Immortal Palace crafted this mechanical construct for Qi Refining stage trial disciples, so it didn’t use any top-grade materials.

“Three Schools Supreme Sage probably wanted to give each trial disciple a decent quality mechanical construct for training.”

Had the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit heard this analysis, it would definitely have been furious enough to spew fire.

What do you mean, ‘decent quality’?

Is that even something a human should say?

The Lava Immortal Palace used up an entire golden furnace for this! The choice of materials also reached the very limit allowed by the room’s standards.

Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng was the best of the best! Even those suspended coffins hanging in midair couldn’t compare to it.

To put it in perspective, the normal standard was wooden blades or wooden swords. Meanwhile, Ning Zhuo’s mechanical construct was like a bronze or iron weapon.

Ning Zhuo attempted to repair the mechanized Yuan Dasheng.

Its body of Vermilion Fire Glass had many fine cracks in it.

Looking closely, its body was faintly translucent.

The message delivered by the Lava Immortal Palace didn’t include a blueprint, but it did state that the body structure was made from Vermilion Flame Stone.

And in Fire Persimmon Mountain, Vermilion Flame Stone was an abundant resource.

Ning Zhuo had quite a bit of it stored in his materials warehouse. He immediately took some out, baked it, and produced a shining, translucent fluid that was colored a bright red.

He dripped the fluid into the cracks. Soon, all of them were as good as new.

Ning Zhuo then studied the monkey fur and revealed a troubled expression.

He couldn’t figure out how this monkey fur was made.

Thus, he decided to do things his way and created some monkey fur for Yuan Dasheng before stitching it to the naked areas of the body.

On the surface, it seemed to match well with the original pelt. But Ning Zhuo knew that the defensive performance had dropped significantly.

After finishing the repairs, Ning Zhuo began cleaning Yuan Dasheng's entire body.

Finally, he took out a handkerchief and occasionally breathed warm air on it, polishing Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng’s golden bones until they gleamed without a speck of dust. Only then was he satisfied.

Just as he was preparing to closely study the mechanized Yuan Dasheng, someone arrived with a message.

Some time later, the messenger departed. Ning Zhuo opened the letter and skimmed through it, slightly raising his eyebrows.

The letter informed him to visit the Zhou Clan the next day. He was to attend an examination to check his cultivation progress and then use the Zhou Clan’s formation to aid his practice.

“So the Ning Clan has allied with Zhou Clan?

“Hm… then the Zheng Clan is likely involved as well.

“The three clans have united. What about the City Lord Mansion?”

Ning Zhuo wasn’t surprised. This shift in the situation was within his expectations.

What made him pause was what kind of image he should present to the three great clans.

After thinking for a short while, Ning Zhuo made a decision. “It’s time to show off some mechanical talent and steal a bit of spotlight.”
