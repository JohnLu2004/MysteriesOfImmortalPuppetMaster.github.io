Chapter 50: Three Techniques Together

Han Ming ate voraciously, completely unlike her previous reluctant self. After finishing all the food, she still wasn’t satisfied. “Anything else?”

Ning Zhuo said, “Sorry, I’ll bring you more next time.”

Han Ming nodded. “It’s better to get me some spirit food. Although these mortal dishes taste good, they’re not very useful for cultivators like us.”

Ning Zhuo grunted. “I’ll consider it.”

Han Ming continued speaking. “By the way, my soul won’t hold on for too long if you keep sucking without restraint. Sooner or later, my soul foundation will all be used up.”

At that time, Han Ming’s soul would scatter, and even becoming a ghost cultivator would be out of her reach.

It was precisely because of this realization that Han Ming chose to compromise and temporarily give in.

Ning Zhuo nodded. “Do you have any good suggestions?”

Han Ming said, “Give me people! As long as I absorb more souls, I can nourish my soul foundation and continuously provide you with soul essence.”

Ning Zhuo smiled. “Actually, I’ve already prepared something for you.”

"Oh?"

Ning Zhuo stood up and left the cell for a moment. When he returned, he was carrying a few monkeys in his hands.

Han Ming’s expression darkened. “I said to give me people. With these monkeys, I can only absorb 30% at most.”

Ning Zhuo laughed. "I can accept 30% efficiency. I’m not some demonic cultivator who goes around harming people. But beasts and monsters are alright.

“There are lots of monkeys on Fire Persimmon Mountain. Killing some of them can also be considered helping the city a little.”

Han Ming couldn’t hold back and laughed mockingly. “You’re not a demonic cultivator, you say?

“No, you’re just unsure of my abilities and are afraid that I’ll secretly recover some power after absorbing human souls.

“Moreover, killing people and killing monkeys are completely different in terms of impact. You’re worried that doing so will result in being exposed sooner!”

Ning Zhuo smiled. “Thank you for the reminder, Han Ming. To be on the safe side, I’ll monitor you strictly with these mechanical needles.”

Seeing Ning Zhuo take out the mechanical needles, Han Ming’s pupils shrank to pinpoints, and anger welled up from within her.

However, she only stared at Ning Zhuo and never uttered a single curse.

…

In the Lava Immortal Palace.

Meng Chong couldn’t remember how many times he’d failed.

To be precise, the exact number of failures was irrelevant to him.

He just wanted to rush through!

After clearing the first room, he picked the hanging ring as his reward. Then, he opened the door very slightly.

Meng Chong carefully stretched the hanging ring out into Room 2.

Clang clang clang…

He generously shot out all the colorful diamonds.

Innate talent – Ferocious Rushing Thunder!

Spell – One Gust of Air!

Mechanical component – hanging ring!

Three powers joined together as Meng Chong flung the door open and rushed out like a cannonball.

His speed immediately reached new heights. Although the traps behind the door were triggered, they couldn’t stop him in time. The net ended up empty, and the Thousand Jun Heavy Hammer Platform landed on nothing but floor.

“Hahaha!” Meng Chong laughed loudly. Wrapped in bright blue electricity, he rushed to the finish line at blinding speed.

The floor tiles moved backward rapidly, but they were far from as fast as Meng Chong.

But suddenly, Meng Chong’s puppet body fell apart!

The moment before his vision turned dark, he saw the culprit clearly. There were transparent wires stretching between the walls, extremely thin and extremely sharp.

The faster Meng Chong ran, the faster these wires sliced him to pieces.

Countless puppet fragments were scattered all over the floor. Blue electricity crackled in the air for a while, but finally dissipated into nothingness.

After returning to his body, Meng Chong sulked for a long time.

Fei Si came over, and after hearing the details, he let out a heartfelt sigh. “I didn’t expect this mechanical arts inheritance to be so difficult! Perhaps we should focus more on this aspect and try solving the traps first before moving on.”

“What? You want me to learn mechanical arts? I can’t even learn alchemy or artifact crafting.” Meng Chong clutched his hair and felt deeply troubled.

“No, I don’t believe it!

“I just couldn’t control myself properly at that speed.

“As long as I can see clearly, I can get through the wires and reach the end!

“Alright, that’s that. Next up, it’s time for some special training. I’m not sleeping for the next three days and three nights!” Meng Chong announced in a loud voice.

Fei Si showed a hesitant expression and quickly gave some advice. “Young master Meng Chong, this won’t do.

“You’ve been overusing your Ferocious Rushing Thunder innate talent recently. Take a look at yourself in the mirror.”

Meng Chong looked in the mirror and found that he had deep eye bags, a haggard visage, and slightly sunken cheeks.

“I can still rush!” Meng Chong didn’t have any hesitation as he raised his head.

Fei Si said urgently, “Young master Meng Chong, you should slow down a little. Although the City Lord Mansion can provide you with unlimited resources, it still takes time to replenish your essence, qi, and spirit.

“Right now, your rate of consumption is much higher than your rate of recovery. This trend is very worrying.”

Meng Chong blinked. “Then how can I quickly replenish my essence, qi, and spirit?”

Fei Si said, “That depends on your cultivation technique.

“Young master, you cultivate the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation, and this technique can help you rapidly replenish your qi. But with only three levels, its effects aren’t very strong.

“As for your essence and soul, without a matching cultivation technique, you can only rely on your body’s natural recovery rate.”

Meng Chong shook his head when he heard this. “Natural recovery is too slow! I’ll go ask my grandfather. He knows a lot of cultivation techniques. As long as I get a couple to practice, won’t I be able to quickly replenish my essence and soul?

“Hahaha, I’m such a genius! I have the Ferocious Rushing Thunder, so my cultivation speed is extremely fast. Cultivating an extra two techniques won’t take more than six days.”

Fei Si smiled bitterly. “If only things were that simple!

“Sir City Lord has calculated that the inheritance test for the Qi Refining stage has very strict entry standards. If you cultivate a different technique, your magical power won’t be recognized. You’ll have to completely disperse your power again before you can enter the palace.”

Meng Chong: “Huh?”

Fei Si continued, “However, Sir City Lord also calculated that there are most likely two other cultivation techniques in the Lava Immortal Palace that complement the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation. Together, these techniques can allow you to cultivate all three dantians at the same time.”

Meng Chong sighed. “There’s no point in telling me all this. After all, I can’t even pass Room 2.”

Fei Si: …

…

In the Lava Immortal Palace.

Under the aggrieved gaze of the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, Ning Zhuo opened the door after clearing Room 9.

He walked through the maintenance room and pushed the next door open as well.

Then, Ning Zhuo’s puppet body arrived in a transit hall.

Once he walked to the center of the hall, he heard mechanical clicking, and the stone walls fell to reveal three doors.

The left door was covered in a pale yellow, auspicious aura. Inscribed on it was the word “Buddha”.

The middle door shone with green light. It bore the word “Dao”.

The right door exuded a strong stench of blood. Its label was “Demon”.

“Well, this is different.

“A Buddha door, a Dao door, and a Demon door…”

Ning Zhuo hadn’t expected this, but he quickly recalled that Three Schools Supreme Sage had practiced Daoist, demonic, and Buddhist techniques during his lifetime. Thus, the current scenario really wasn’t anything strange.

He touched the Dao door, but there was no reaction.

He then touched the Buddha door, and obtained a technique – the “Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Incantation”.

Finally, he touched the Demon door, and obtained another technique called the “Demonic Pollution Blood Sinew Technique”[^1]!

Just like the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation, these two techniques only had the first three levels. But after studying them for a while, Ning Zhuo’s puppet body trembled with excitement.

“These three techniques complement each other and allow you to cultivate the three dantians simultaneously.

“Three techniques of Buddhism, Daoism, and the demonic way, each cultivating one dantian and all reaching Foundation Establishment at the same time?!

“This method of establishing a foundation is at the top of the world!”

Notes:

[^1]: Demonic Pollution Blood Sinew Technique – Other translations have simplified this to Demonic Blood Vein Technique, but that’s a mistranslation. The technique’s name is 魔染血筋功, with 魔 meaning Demonic, 血 meaning Blood, and 筋 referring to either veins or tendons. Calling it the “Demonic Blood Vein Technique” erases the 染 character, which can mean “to dye” or “to color”. Usages of the technique in later chapters make it clear that this is an essential part of the technique’s description. “Demonic Dyeing” sounds a bit weak, so I chose “Demonic Pollution” to keep a similar meaning. “Sinew” was chosen as a more general term than vein or tendon. Thus, “Demonic Pollution Blood Sinew Technique”.
