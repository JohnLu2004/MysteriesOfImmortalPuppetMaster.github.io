Chapter 603: The Yang Heaven Variable

Meng Yaoyin's voice came from the Interwoven Field Paths Lantern, but it resonated deep within Ning Zhuo’s divine sea.

"Successor of the Interwoven Field Paths Lantern, you possess a Million Man Soul and hold power over White Paper Immortal City. You must be the Heaven-ordained variable that Ash Bone Elder foretold!"

"You must thwart the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord’s scheme and return peace to the entirety of the Ghostly Black Marshlands."

With those words came a massive influx of information, flooding Ning Zhuo’s mind.

Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual… the skull of the Heavenly Ghost… postnatal aptitude… choosing White Paper Immortal City as a blood sacrifice… to offer tribute to Yin Heaven…

Moments later, Ning Zhuo fully absorbed the astonishing revelations. His eyes gleamed with sharp light. “So that’s what it is!”

In that instant, he grasped the entirety of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord’s grand plan.

And within that same transmission, Meng Yaoyin had also given him a means to fight back.

She clearly stated that she had once descended into the Underworld herself and been received personally by Ash Bone Elder. Under his guidance, she had triggered the mechanisms left behind by the Mystic Ink Scholar, allowing her to use formation techniques to control half of the paper soldier army.

However, how to actually destroy the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord’s scheme - Meng Yaoyin had not explained. Instead, she expressed complete faith in her successor: since this change was born of the Heaven’s will in the world of the living, then a path to victory must exist.

“So that’s what it is.”

“So the Heaven-bestowed talisman my boss holds has such a background.”

“Ash Bone Elder…”

Ning Zhuo had heard that name once before, from Luo Si’s lips. But now, the meaning behind it felt completely different.

“So Mother prepared all this long ago, waiting for the tides of fate to shift. Now that the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord is on the verge of success, it may seem like coincidence that I ended up here - but I’m probably the very variable fate had arranged!”

“I must give it my all and carry out Mother’s will, to see this through properly.”

Knowing how important this was, Ning Zhuo immediately used the Life Hanging by a Thread technique to contact Sun Lingtong.

Sun Lingtong, still stationed within the Yin Army formation, was watching White Paper Immortal City repel the ghost tide. Upon hearing the news, he was deeply astonished.

“Incredible, Little Zhuo. Your mother’s methods are truly astounding. She actually managed to steal command of half the paper soldier army - this is incredible!”

Ning Zhuo replied, “According to the information Mother left behind, someone has to personally go and activate the formation before that half of the army can be controlled.”

“But as for how to use that power to foil the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord’s plan - Mother didn’t say.”

Sun Lingtong was unconcerned. “Little Zhuo, your mother isn’t some kind of diviner. The fact that she managed this much is already incredible. And really, she did give you a hint about what to do next, didn’t she?”

Ning Zhuo knew exactly what Sun Lingtong meant. He nodded. “Right. Since it was Ash Bone Elder who guided my mother back then, and even arranged for the hidden army of White Paper Immortal City to be activated - ”

“Then we should find this cultivator and seek his advice.”

Sun Lingtong added, “Ash Bone Elder might already be waiting for us. He arranged for Luo Si to fish at the banks of the Underworld’s Forgetful River - perhaps that was meant to bring us into contact.”

“If that’s the case, then General Luo Si might be Ash Bone Elder’s agent… and possibly even an ally of ours?”

Ning Zhuo mused aloud, “It’s possible. But we’ll need to meet Ash Bone Elder and get more information before we can be sure.”

“Boss,” Ning Zhuo said with a chuckle, “looks like you’ll have to postpone your Golden Core breakthrough again.”

Sun Lingtong fell silent for a moment, then gave a bitter laugh. “No helping it! Now that we know the truth, I’ll have to double down on my soul cultivation too. I need to push my soul foundation to Million Man Soul - only then will I be qualified to disrupt the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual.”

Ning Zhuo had already reached the threshold of a million souls. Sun Lingtong now resolved to do the same, to serve as a second line of defense.

He hesitated. “Should we tell White Paper City Lord about this?”

Ning Zhuo frowned and considered it. “Mother didn’t mention the city lord in her message. Clearly, she had her reasons.”

“Whatever her concerns were, she must’ve believed that resolving this crisis doesn’t require the city lord’s involvement.”

“Hmph!”

“My mother gave up her lifespan for the sake of this immortal city. She exhausted herself, even descended into the Underworld, and laid all these plans for the future... She was far too generous and selfless, thinking only of the greater good.”

“But what did the city lord sacrifice?”

“She saw me and immediately called me her savior! It’s obvious she wants to use me - just like she once used my mother.”

“But what she doesn’t realize is that while I’m my mother’s son, our temperaments are not the same.”

“I’m willing to be a savior. I don’t mind doing a few good deeds. But only if I get something out of it.”

“I don’t have my mother’s level of selfless enlightenment.”

Hearing this, Sun Lingtong let out a breath of relief and beamed with praise. “Now that’s more like it, Little Zhuo! We’re not here to be self-sacrificing saints all the time - that’s just boring.”

“Your mother played the high game. That’s her business.”

Ning Zhuo nodded. “Exactly.”

Even now, the three talisman papers the city lord had forced upon him were still sealed inside his three dantians.

He had used the energy of his spirit, qi, and essence to encircle and suppress the talismans, locking them down tight.

He was just waiting for the right moment to have Sun Lingtong use his thieving arts to try and extract them.

Now would be too soon.

The city lord would definitely grow suspicious and reinforce her measures.

The ghost tide raged on for three days and three nights before it finally receded.

“We made it through another wave,” muttered Tie Guzheng, still holding his post atop the city wall. He had gone without sleep for three straight days, fighting with all his might.

But there was no joy of victory in his face - only a grim gaze cast beyond the wall.

There, a well-disciplined army of underworld troops was slowly retreating.

They had not taken part in the assault, but instead moved quickly to gather the remaining stray ghosts. In fact, from the start of the battle to their withdrawal, their numbers had grown by twenty percent.

“Damn it! We couldn’t break that vanguard force. It’s maddening,” Tie Guzheng snarled, slamming a fist against the battlement.

In stark contrast stood Qing Chi.

“This time, my battle merit definitely qualifies, right?” she exclaimed, practically bouncing with excitement.

Qing Yan’s expression soured, but he couldn’t deny the truth. He gave a reluctant nod. “It does. Chi’er, no need to calculate further. You’ve earned it.”

“But right now, Vigorous Yang Manor is under full lockdown. If you try to visit that brat Jiao Ma, you’ll be blocked at every turn - and you’ll drag him into trouble too.”

“After all, he’s already the city lord’s favored consort.”

Qing Chi’s brows shot up. She glared. “Father, are you trying to go back on your word?”

Qing Yan hurriedly waved his hands. “No, no, of course not! I’m just saying - if you want to see Jiao Ma, you need to go about it the right way. I can write him a letter, arrange a private meeting somewhere discreet. That’s much better than trying to sneak into Vigorous Yang Manor, isn’t it?”

Only then did Qing Chi finally calm down, nodding again and again. “You're right, Dad. I can’t do anything at Vigorous Yang Manor - can’t even speak freely. It’s much easier outside.”

Qing Yan nodded in agreement, then his expression suddenly shifted as he raised a hand. “Hold on!”

“You can’t do anything in the courtyard - what exactly is it you’re planning to do?”

“And outside is easier? Easier for what?”

Qing Chi gave a cold snort. “Dad, I’m not a child anymore. Don’t try to control me. I have my own plans.”

Qing Yan’s eye twitched in fury. “Don’t you dare do anything reckless! Jiao Ma’s yang essence is still intact - it’s crucial to his cultivation!”

“Hmph. That’s exactly why I held back before,” Qing Chi retorted. “I didn’t want to force things. But now, there’s still time…”

Qing Yan was so furious he nearly stomped his foot. “No, absolutely not! You’re a girl - if you’re too forward, he won’t treasure you! Chi’er, you must have patience…”

“Patience?!” Qing Chi flung out her arm, her voice rising with emotion. “You want me to just sit and watch while Jiao Ma dual cultivates with that old hag, the White Paper City Lord? I won’t allow it!”

The moment Qing Yan heard her call the White Paper City Lord an “old hag,” his face went pale with shock and fury. He glared and hissed, “Watch your tongue! You really have no filter!”

But Qing Chi wasn’t the least bit afraid of her father and opened her mouth to say more.

Qing Yan quickly waved his hands to cut her off. “Enough, enough! You thick-headed girl, fine - do whatever you want. Go throw yourself into disaster. Forget about your father, forget about this family!”

That outburst, unexpectedly, softened Qing Chi’s stance. “Dad…”

“I’m sorry. Don’t be angry.”

“I’m just too anxious to save little Ma.”

Qing Yan covered his face with a long sigh, unable to say another word.

Meanwhile, Ning Zhuo had long since returned to Vigorous Yang Manor and resumed his grueling cultivation.

After the army withdrew, Sun Lingtong spoke briefly with the commanding general, stating that he was returning to the Underworld.

With Luo Si’s military order in hand, Sun Lingtong was free to come and go. The commander even pointed out the route back.

He dove into the main channel of the Underworld Flood Dragon River, plunging deep until he pierced the boundary between the living world and the dead.

Though he didn’t know the exact path, he could contact Ning Zhuo at any time - and the latter had full control of the Interwoven Field Paths Lantern.

Following Ning Zhuo’s guidance, Sun Lingtong pressed on.

His destination: the seventh paper soldier legion.

This unit was still incomplete, currently in the process of formation.

That very incompleteness had allowed the likes of Ash Bone Elder and Meng Yaoyin to interfere, seizing control of the legion for themselves.

As he traveled, Sun Lingtong retrieved a talisman.

It was crafted from black jade, three inches and seven-tenths long, glowing with a dim golden light.

The front bore the complete Four-Seal Sigil of Yama at its center, ringed around the edges by illustrations of the Eighteen Hells.

The back was inscribed with cinnabar script, containing the Thirteen Chapters of the Underworld Code.

It was none other than the Heaven-bestowed Talisman!

“So this jade talisman never made it to Ning Zhuo. I’m the one using it in the end,” Sun Lingtong murmured.

He continued on, quietly activating the talisman.

In that instant, a vast surge of soul force poured into his spirit.

The power was immense - and more importantly, utterly pure.

Sun Lingtong’s expression shifted at once. He could feel his soul swelling like a balloon, expanding rapidly under the influx.

Unlike Ning Zhuo’s cultivation, which relied on the Four Sacred Treasures, Sun Lingtong’s soul foundation surged directly - swift, steady, and without the slightest instability.

His physical body was far stronger than Ning Zhuo’s as well, more than capable of bearing the rapid expansion of his soul.

By the time he reached the Seventh Paper Soldier Battalion, Sun Lingtong’s soul foundation had already reached the level of over Two Hundred Thousand Man Soul.

Of course, he hadn’t started from nothing. He was older than Ning Zhuo, so it was only natural that his soul foundation was deeper to begin with.

“Little Zhuo, you should’ve used this talisman instead. This is hands-down the most efficient way to cultivate,” Sun Lingtong said sincerely.

“Once this village passes, there’s no more shop down the road. It’s not every day you get to fleece a husband of the Underworld.”

Ning Zhuo let out a loud laugh. “Now that sounds familiar. Weren’t you the one I had to convince like this last time?”

Sun Lingtong replied, “There’s practically no downside. If I had to name one, it’s that you get this constant phantom noise in your ears. You start hearing someone chanting a funeral hymn - really annoying.”

Ning Zhuo’s eyes lit up. “What’s in the chant?”

“I’ve memorized most of it,” Sun Lingtong said, then began to recite:

“In reverence we offer to the Sovereign of the Lunar Throne, light cast down from the Nine Underworlds. The Yanluo Kings hold the laws, binding souls across the ten directions of the Underworld. Snow surges from the Yellow Springs; spirits cross through myriad tribulations in the vastness beyond.

Now, by the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual, we offer devotion to the Underworld Heaven’s Master...

We present the Sacred Seal of the Four Corners at the Black Altar, arrayed in the true images of the Eighteen Hells as our veil. Black snow cloaks the ground sevenfold, nurturing the Yin Fiend with Yang soul. Cinnabar scripts the Ninefold Transformation of Heaven, invoking the Underworld Law to pierce the void...

We beseech the Yin Heavens to open a swift path through the Underworld, to cleanse the festering sins of lost souls. Grant us the Celestial Talisman, to anchor the soul’s origin at the Spirit Terrace. May...

...with humble rites and solemn words, we entreat you to partake!”

Ning Zhuo’s face lit up with joy. “That must be the Grand Rite Invocation for the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual. Big Brother, memorize the whole thing carefully - there might be a clue in there that could help us crack this entire situation open.”

Sun Lingtong shook his head. “Neither of us is a scholar-cultivator. Trying to find a loophole in a ritual text like this? That’s a long shot - don’t get your hopes up.”

Ning Zhuo said, “When the time’s right, we can show this chant to Wen Ruanyu…”

“Let’s set that aside for now. First, we need to get control of this half-formed battalion. Then we head straight for the Water Burial Valley. These paper puppets are enough to prove our identity and earn Ash Bone Elder’s trust.”

“And if trouble shows up, we’ve got a small army to throw at it.”

Sun Lingtong nodded. “Little Zhuo, from here on out, I’ll follow your lead.”

Ning Zhuo followed the message left by his mother and guided Sun Lingtong to the formation disk hidden deep underground.

Sun Lingtong poured his spiritual energy into the disk - but nothing happened.

After examining it more closely, he figured it out. “This is a Myriad Manifestations Formation Disk. It needs myriad manifestations spiritual energy to activate. What now?”

Ning Zhuo fell into thought. “Looks like Mother intended this opportunity for the Myriad Manifestations Sect to benefit from.”

“No problem.”

“I remember chatting with Wen Ruanyu - he told me that one of their entry-level spells, the Transmutation Method, can generate Myriad Manifestations energy.”

“I’ll message him right now and ask for the technique.”

While Ning Zhuo was busy mobilizing troops in the underworld, Qing Chi arrived at the gates of the Vigorous Yang Manor.

“Please inform Jiao Ma that Qing Chi is here to see him!” Her eyes sparkled, full of anticipation.

“A little girl like you, and your beloved has already become the City Lord’s consort?” A voice suddenly sounded behind her.
