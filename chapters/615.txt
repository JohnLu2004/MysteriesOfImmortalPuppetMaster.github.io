Chapter 615: Joy and Sorrow

Sun Family.

The footage of Qing Chi slaying the Wandering Ghost General, followed by the Qing-Jiao Army's subsequent defense of the city walls, driving back the ghostly creatures, was replayed for the fourteenth time before the Sun Clan High Council.

The Sun Clan cultivators had meticulously studied the Qing-Jiao Army over twenty times, combining all the intelligence they had gathered.

"There's no doubt - this is a true Cultivation army!"

"While Qing Chi is a prodigy, capable of Golden Core-level combat power even in the Foundation Establishment Stage, her final strike clearly exceeded her previous limits. This is the amplification of Military Power!"

"What should we do?"

The Sun Clan High Council fell into silence.

This unexpected development presented them with an unprecedented dilemma.

Someone broke the silence, asking, "What is Sun Tiesheng's current status?"

"The Spirit Contract Treasure Refining Formation in Vigorous Yang Manor is still active, and Golden Swallow Trident shows no signs of bonding with a master."

"What about Jiao Ma?"

"Ever since he successfully defended himself against the accusations, he has gained favor with the City Lord. He has neglected his duties in the Spirit Contract Treasure Refining Formation, frequently leaving Vigorous Yang Manor, and shows little interest in the Golden Swallow Trident."

"..."

Another silence descended.

Sun Tiesheng's father spoke up: "We must not underestimate Jiao Ma! This could be a deception by the Jiao Clan to mislead us. It's highly possible."

"Look at the Jiao Clan's involvement in creating the New Army. They've been keeping a low profile all along. Suddenly, they've joined forces with the Ghostman Clan's Qing Family and established a true cultivation army!"

An elder of the Sun Clan sighed, "A cultivation army... I never thought they could actually pull it off. How many times has White Paper Immortal City tried and failed?"

Another elder shook his head. "We can't look at it that way. Throughout history, White Paper Immortal City has come close to success, only to have its efforts sabotaged from the shadows."

"Upon investigation, we've found traces of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, the Soul Devouring Sect, and other super sects. The inquiries always came to a dead end."

"Their success this time is truly a matter of timing. All parties are fully supporting them."

The leader of the Sun Clan nodded slightly. "That's right."

"First, there's Lord Li Xiangshang, our demon cultivator. His extraordinary talent in assisting with the army's formation was completely unexpected."

"Second, the City Lord of White Paper Immortal City has shown remarkable generosity, repeatedly allocating funds without regard for future political implications. She seems utterly unconcerned about the army growing too powerful, a scale of investment that leaves us in awe."

"Third, Qing Chi, though young, possesses exceptional talent. Her previous battlefield efforts had already solidified the Military Heart. Now, she's astonishingly transforming that Military Heart into a Military Seed, repeatedly exceeding expectations."

"Furthermore, the Qing and Jiao Clans threw their full support behind the effort, emptying their coffers and deploying their elite warriors to form the core of the New Army."

"Finally, the Myriad Manifestations Sect, the Soul Devouring Sect, and other super sects, wary of the Ghost Tide and the Yin Soldier armies, tacitly allowed the New Army to be established."

The relationship between these super sects and White Paper Immortal City was complex. They served as both its protectors and obstacles to its growth. Normally, they wouldn't want the city to become too powerful, monopolizing all the resources of the Ghostly Black Marshlands.

The Ghost Tide phenomenon had to be viewed from two perspectives. On one hand, it brought immense hardship and challenges to White Paper Immortal City. On the other hand, it was also a surging wave of resources. While ghostly creatures were dangerous, their remains yielded high-quality cultivation materials. These resources were common in the Underworld but rare and difficult to gather in the Yang Realm, some being exceedingly scarce.

Everyone agreed with Sun Clan Leader's analysis. Without any one of these factors, the New Army could never have been established. Creating a true cultivation army was incredibly difficult. Only now, with perfect timing, favorable circumstances, and united will, had all the necessary elements converged to make it possible.

Even so, the New Army wasn't fully established yet. It was still navigating the crucial stages of military logistics and organizational structure, with further steps to follow.

The Sun Clan High Council continued their discussion, each member chiming in with their thoughts.

"That Jiao Ma is quite cunning. He's likely concealing his true intentions and secretly plotting to seize the Golden Swallow Trident."

"Even if he isn't, we must assume he is. The Golden Swallow Trident is far too crucial to our Sun Family."

"He possesses exceptional cultivation talent. Otherwise, the Jiao Clan wouldn't have chosen him as a Male Consort."

"Now, with the Qing-Jiao Army bolstering his reputation, I'm certain that if I were the City Lord in the same situation, I would abandon Sun Tiesheng and choose Jiao Ma. After all, Jiao Ma and Qing Chi share an exceptionally close bond."

The Qing-Jiao Army's sensational debut had captivated both allies and enemies, prompting intense scrutiny from all sides.

Jiao Ma and Qing Chi made no attempt to conceal their past, resulting in a thorough investigation that revealed their childhood intimacy as childhood sweethearts. Everyone now knew of their deep connection.

"What if..." One of the Sun Clan elders suddenly had an idea. "What if we exploit this very connection?"

The other elders' eyes lit up.

Soon, rumors, fueled by the Sun Family, began to spread like wildfire throughout the Immortal City.

"Jiao Ma (Ning Zhuo), a male consort, is unchaste and having an affair with Qing Chi!"

"The White Paper City Lord, weakened in her true form, is being cuckolded without realizing it. She's pouring all her efforts into helping Qing Chi build the New Army."

"The White Paper City Lord is trapped by circumstances. Forced to establish a Cultivation army, she grits her teeth and supports the military buildup despite knowing she's being betrayed. She'll surely seek revenge in the future!"

"Qing Chi is ambitious. She wants both the handsome Jiao Ma and the White Paper City Lord's position."

All the rumors pointed directly at Qing Chi. After all, who else was making such a splash?

Ning Zhuo, despite living a secluded life and deliberately keeping a low profile to hide his secret role as deputy commander of the Qing-Jiao Army, was dragged into the scandal simply because of his close relationship with Qing Chi.

The gossip surrounding the White Paper City Lord's personal affairs and romantic entanglements spread like wildfire, fueling the rumors.

Rumors could be deadly!

Various factions and powerful figures closely monitored the White Paper City Lord's reaction.

Under the public gaze, the White Paper City Lord summoned Jiao Ma with great fanfare. The doors remained tightly shut for a full half-hour before Jiao Ma finally withdrew.

While the outside world speculated about what kind of interrogation or reprimand Jiao Ma had endured, he was leisurely sipping tea.

The White Paper City Lord's avatar personally received Ning Zhuo, praising him, "Truly worthy of being the savior prophesied in the prophetic poem! You saved the paper statue last time, and now you've facilitated the formation of the New Army. The entire crisis is shifting because of you, Jiao Ma."

All of this only deepened the White Paper City Lord's expectations.

As for the rumors, they had been traced back to the Sun Family. With just a nod from Ning Zhuo, the White Paper City Lord would immediately issue a City Lord's decree, wiping the entire Sun Family from existence.

"How dare they sow discord between the City Lord and the savior for their own selfish gain? Their treacherous schemes deserve death!"

Ning Zhuo immediately shook his head. "There's no need for such drastic measures. The Immortal City is surrounded by dangers, both inside and out. The Sun Family still has its uses. Who doesn't harbor personal ambitions? Their actions can be forgiven."

"Moreover, rashly exterminating an entire clan would be a cruel act that our enemies could easily exploit. We still haven't uncovered the true identity of the traitor within our ranks."

The White Paper City Lord's avatar immediately showered Ning Zhuo with praise, extolling his magnanimity, his dedication to the greater good, and his extraordinary moral character, far surpassing that of ordinary people.

As the "injured party," the White Paper City Lord showed none of the haughtiness expected of a Nascent Soul cultivator. Instead, she praised Jiao Ma for his magnanimity. If word of this got out, no one in the entire city would believe it.

The White Paper City Lord summoned Qing Chi, Qing Yan, and Jiao Ma's father.

The three arrived trembling with apprehension. The City Lord's clone treated them with icy indifference. She listened to their reports in turn, then summoned paper puppet servants to serve tea before excusing herself.

The three were forced to drink several rounds of tea and sample Dark Stream pastries in the main hall, kept waiting for a full hour before being dismissed.

From the City Lord's perspective, she had long since discovered that Jiao Ma was Ning Zhuo in disguise. She wasn't concerned about the emotional connection between Jiao Ma and Qing Chi, in fact, she was reassured by it.

Having this secret in her grasp, she knew that revealing it would immediately fracture the relationship between Jiao Ma and the Qing-Jiao Army.

She wouldn't act on it - at least not yet. For now, maintaining the appearance of intimacy between "Jiao Ma" and Qing Chi served White Paper Immortal City's interests better.

The City Lord's two instances of leniency spoke volumes, allowing both allies and enemies, as well as the various factions within the Immortal City, to swiftly grasp the situation.

That very night, at least six factions secretly approached Qing Yan.

Though Qing Yan was a Golden Core cultivator, he remained a member of the Ghostman Clan, considered inferior by many.

Jiao Ma's father, a Golden Core cultivator of the Human Clan, received a stack of invitations. Over a dozen factions disregarded the late hour and paid him visits.

Even Ning Zhuo had visitors.

Ning Zhuo politely declined most of them. He had no patience for these opportunistic factions and their insincere overtures, which would only waste his precious cultivation time.

Speaking of which, Qing Chi's comprehension of the Military System had spurred Ning Zhuo onward.

While Qing Chi had no prior experience with military strategy, Ning Zhuo possessed the accumulated knowledge of two major national wars and two treasures of the Military Strategist school: Gao Sheng's Lost Writings and the Ancient Shared - Battle Armor.

He was eager to use these treasures to aid him, but unfortunately, he had yet to fully master the Heroic Return Technique. Only upon achieving complete mastery could he wield the Ancient Shared - Battle Armor.

Sun Lingtong, on the other hand, was ready. However, Ning Zhuo currently had more pressing matters. Sun Lingtong's mere presence within the enemy ranks, providing crucial military intelligence, was already invaluable and irreplaceable.

"I refuse to believe it," Ning Zhuo muttered, immersed in his study of military manuals. Just then, a "friend" arrived, forcing him to interrupt his cultivation to receive the guest.

It was none other than Yang Weida.

Ning Zhuo led Yang Weida into the reception room, where Yang immediately knelt, declaring his intention to pledge allegiance.

Startled, Ning Zhuo quickly helped him up. "Brother Yang, there's no need for such formality!"

Yang Weida forced a bitter smile. "Brother Jiao, you're usually as elusive as a dragon's tail. I've waited anxiously for days, finally catching you back at Vigorous Yang Manor."

"Please don't misunderstand my motives for coming here. I offer my loyalty with utmost sincerity."

Yang Weida then demonstrated his sincerity.

He presented Ning Zhuo with a heavy storage pouch, containing nearly his entire fortune.

"I've been a merchant for many years and accumulated modest wealth. Hearing of the New Army's formation and its need for funding, I wish to contribute what little I can. Though it's but a drop in the ocean, I hope Brother Jiao will accept it."

Ning Zhuo fell silent.

The assets in the pouch exceeded those of most Foundation Establishment cultivators. Among them was a rare treasure material called Void-Piercing Shuttle Iron, a Nascent Soul-grade substance rarely seen on the market.

Perplexed, Ning Zhuo looked up at Yang Weida. "I can understand why other factions from the Immortal City would seek to join us. But you're an outsider. Why go to such lengths?"

Yang Weida sighed deeply, his face etched with bitterness.

Sensing his mood, Ning Zhuo gestured for him to sit and offered tea.

Yang Weida sat upright, drinking his tea in small sips, completely adopting a deferential demeanor, his previous camaraderie gone.

Setting down his cup, he shifted the conversation: "Brother Jiao, are you aware that Sun Tiesheng has agreed to accept the Golden Nest Demon Seed from Lord Li Xiangshang?"

"Oh?" Ning Zhuo had heard rumors of this. He turned to Yang Weida. "Your intelligence network is quite thorough."

Yang Weida shook his head with a wry smile. "Brother Jiao, as I mentioned before, my elder brother is Yang Third Eye, a True Inheritor disciple of the Myriad Manifestations Sect. My access to information merely stems from leveraging the sect's local branch here - nothing remarkable."

Though he claimed it was "nothing remarkable," he meticulously reiterated Yang Third Eye's name and status.

Yang Weida fixed Ning Zhuo with a piercing gaze. "Given the Qing-Jiao Army's influence and your standing with the Lord City Master, I'm certain you've known about this for some time. Yet you've taken no action, seemingly content to let Sun Tiesheng succeed?"

Ning Zhuo nodded.

For him, the Golden Swallow Trident had never been the primary concern. What truly interested him was whether this situation could expose any hidden traitors.

The Golden Swallow Trident itself held little strategic significance in the grand scheme of things.

Ning Zhuo reiterated his sincerity, speaking plainly to Yang Weida: "As I confessed to you earlier, Brother Yang, I was being truthful. I have little ambition for the Golden Swallow Trident."

Yang Weida's expression grew even more complex. For a moment, he simply stared at Ning Zhuo in silence.

After a long pause, he sighed bitterly: "Sometimes, people can't be compared. What we strive for with all our might is something Brother Jiao sees as utterly insignificant."

"Alas, even though I knew this beforehand, the reality still fills me with profound frustration!"

"With the Qing-Jiao Army behind him, Brother Jiao's position is secure without him having to fight for it. His future is as solid as Mount Tai!"

"Compared to you, we..."

Yang Weida shook his head with a wry smile, his demeanor tinged with melancholy.

Sensing Yang Weida's mood, Ning Zhuo remained silent for a moment.

Yang Weida continued: "Do you know that Sun Tiesheng wept through the entire night?"

Ning Zhuo raised an eyebrow. "Is that true?"

Yang Weida nodded gravely. "Lord Li Xiangshang established the Qing-Jiao Army and hinted at his intention to select Brother Jiao to compete for the Golden Swallow Trident."

"Cornered, the Sun Family had no choice but to abandon their previous plans, forcing Sun Tiesheng to submit and use the Golden Nest Demon Seed."

"From that day forward, Sun Tiesheng became half-human, half-demon, effectively severing his path to cultivation."

"Though born out of wedlock, he had always been fiercely independent. Yet the relentless pressure of circumstances forced him to yield."

"He wept bitterly through the night. I understand completely; had it been me, I would have been even more devastated and lost control."

"However..."

"Even with this fate, he enjoys privileges most male consorts can only dream of, privileges they would gladly trade places with him for."

"To be frank, Brother Jiao, I am one of them!"

Yang Weida pointed to himself. "My talent is lacking, preventing me from joining the Myriad Manifestations Sect. Yet my ambition burns fiercely, driving me to carve out my own path to glory."

"I've spent years as a merchant, traveling far and wide, enduring countless hardships and brushes with death."

"My arrival in White Paper Immortal City was drawn by its opportunities. For people like us, fortune lies only in danger."

"Only in such perilous places can opportunities like this ever fall to our lot."

"Originally, I hoped to leverage the status of a male consort to seize opportunities and rise in status. Now, with you, Brother Jiao, showing no interest, the Golden Swallow Trident seems destined to fall into Sun Tiesheng's hands."

"As a male consort in Vigorous Yang Manor, my position has become exceedingly awkward."

"My future looks bleak, so naturally, I'm seeking alternative paths," Yang Weida stated, making his intentions clear.

He understood that he couldn't rise to prominence on his own, but by aligning himself with Ning Zhuo, he could achieve his ambitions.

If I can't succeed alone, I'll attach myself to a strong figure.

This was a common survival strategy among cultivators.

Ning Zhuo frowned slightly, harboring some doubts. "Brother Yang, wouldn't you be better off joining your own brother rather than relying on an outsider like me?"

Yang Weida shook his head with a bitter smile. "As I mentioned before, my brother holds a unique position within the Myriad Manifestations Sect. The usual familial favoritism doesn't apply to him. This is for his own protection."

After a moment of contemplation, Ning Zhuo nodded and accepted the resources. "Understood. I'll take these resources and guarantee you a promising future!"

He thought to himself: Even if I'm not the real Jiao Ma, as the savior and Vice City Lord of White Paper Immortal City, I can still secure opportunities for Yang Weida's advancement.

Ning Zhuo needed money.

More precisely, Military Logistics at this stage desperately required all kinds of resources - the more, the better!

Vigorous Yang Manor had descended into turmoil.

Most Male Consorts sought promotion to this position solely for the Golden Swallow Trident. By refining this treasure, they could secure long-term influence with the White Paper City Lord, effectively gaining a position of immense power.

But now, with the Golden Swallow Trident about to be claimed, many Male Consorts, like Yang Weida, were scrambling to find alternative paths.

One day later...

"Hahaha..." Sun Tiesheng raised the Golden Swallow Trident high above his head.

He had succeeded.

The fork emitted a warm golden light that bathed Sun Tiesheng's entire body.

Sun Tiesheng's appearance had transformed. No longer purely Human Clan, he now possessed narrow, elongated eyes and golden-tipped eyebrows.

The surrounding crowd erupted in cheers and congratulations.

Yet Sun Tiesheng's laughter soon dissolved into tears.

He had become the center of attention, overshadowing the Qing-Jiao Army and rising from sparrow to phoenix. As long as he wielded the Golden Swallow Trident, he would undoubtedly hold a high position within the White Paper Immortal City.

He felt joy, yet also sorrow.

He felt helplessness, yet also resentment.

He had been forced into this role; his clan's ambitions had demanded it. He had no choice but to comply - a fate sealed the moment he accepted their patronage.

Every gain came with its price.

"Enough, Tiesheng. The clan hasn't wronged you, and we hope you won't harbor resentment."

"We originally intended to protect your path to cultivation, but who could have foreseen the sudden rise of the Qing-Jiao Army?"

"We all know Li Xiangshang orchestrated this. But... fate is fickle. Blame your destiny."

Sun Tiesheng closed his eyes, then slowly opened them, his expression now calm. "I understand."

His father patted him on the shoulder, then clapped his hands. "Good! Tiesheng has mastered the Golden Swallow Trident - this is a joyous occasion. Not just for Tiesheng, but for the entire Sun Family!"

"A joyous occasion calls for a grand celebration, don't you agree?"

"Absolutely!" an elder immediately chimed in.

"Let's seize this opportunity to elevate the Sun Family's prestige!"

"We must make it magnificent. With the Golden Swallow Trident, our family will leap to new heights and become a permanent power in White Paper Immortal City!"

The Sun Clan High Council unanimously agreed.

In truth, they had already been preparing a celebratory banquet.

That very evening, they extended lavish invitations. The Sun Family's halls overflowed with distinguished guests, and even Vigorous Yang Manor was transformed into a venue for the festivities.

Many Male Consorts, some seeking new opportunities and others simply pledging allegiance to the Sun Family, participated in the banquet with complex emotions, congratulating Sun Tiesheng on his transformed appearance.

Those who frequently crossed paths with the Sun Family hoped to forge favorable connections.

The banquet lasted through the night, its clamor and extravagance drawing the attention of countless powerful factions and experts.

The next morning...

"Death! Death everywhere!"

"They're all dead! It's over!"

"My heavens! Vigorous Yang Manor is destroyed!"

Every Male Consort who had attended the banquet had perished, with Sun Tiesheng himself among the first to fall.

Ning Zhuo rushed to the scene upon hearing the news.

In a corner of the banquet hall, he discovered Yang Weida's lifeless body.
