Chapter 614: Famous in the Region!

White Paper Immortal City.

Wave after wave of the Ghost Tide crashed against the city walls.

The defense force, built around the City Guard and bolstered by countless cultivators from the surrounding area, held their ground behind the fortifications.

Countless ghosts were shattered into wisps of nothingness every moment, while many cultivators fell in battle.

Tie Guzheng, commander of the City Guard, watched the battlefield with a grim expression, issuing orders to adjust the city's defenses.

"Only three Reserve Army units remain," Tie Guzheng thought heavily.

Earlier, the White Paper City Lord had offered generous rewards to brave warriors, mobilizing nearly all available forces from the surrounding area to reinforce the defenses. This desperate measure had allowed the city to hold out for so long.

But after enduring repeated Ghost Tide assaults, the city's defenses had been severely depleted, and manpower was once again stretched thin.

"Report! The western gate is under critical assault! Large numbers of Soul-Hooking Geckos have scaled the walls and seized a section of the ramparts!" An urgent military report arrived.

Tie Guzheng's brow furrowed deeper. He quickly assessed the situation and realized that none of the three Reserve Army units were adequately equipped to handle the threat.

"Besides taking matters into my own hands, our only hope lies with the Qing-Jiao Army."

The Qing-Jiao Army was a force led by Qing Chi and Jiao Ma (Ning Zhuo), funded and staffed by the Ghostman Clan's Qing Clan and the Human Clan's Jiao Clan.

Strictly speaking, Qing Chi had yet to fully establish the army; it was still in its formative stages.

"We've received our orders! To the West Gate!" Inside the city, Qing Chi opened her eyes and sprang to her feet.

She had been impatiently awaiting the order to strike.

The other cultivators, long prepared for battle, moved swiftly to follow her.

Qing Chi burst out of the temporary barracks, charging toward the West Gate.

A large group of cultivators surged after her.

"Finally, they're moving..." Ning Zhuo watched from afar, hidden in the shadows.

"Their marching discipline isn't as polished as the Three Generals Camp or the Red Flower Camp - they haven't had time for formal training. But in this city, with its narrow alleys and winding streets, there's no room for large-scale formations anyway."

"Still, this weakness must be addressed."

"After all, the battlefields of the Underworld won't be this complex."

A section of the city wall near the west gate was now devoid of cultivators, occupied instead by dozens of Soul-Hooking Geckos clustered together.

Simultaneously, a massive swarm of geckos continued to scale the wall, surging toward the parapet.

The walls of White Paper Immortal City were not easily climbed. Layer upon layer of wallpaper, each sheet a Talisman Paper, burned continuously. Many ghosts screamed in agony upon contact, the weaker ones reduced to ash.

The stronger Soul-Hooking Geckos endured the burning Talisman Paper, clinging to the wall with lingering sparks.

The geckos flicked their tongues, licking each other's bodies to extinguish the remaining embers.

They were rapidly recovering!

The commander witnessing this scene, his eyes bloodshot, knew they couldn't afford to let this continue.

"If this goes on, this section of the wall will fall! If we lose it, the west gate will be in danger. Then we'll be the ones responsible for the city's downfall!"

"One more time! Everyone, charge with me!"

The commander's voice was hoarse from shouting. Despite his injuries, he led the charge.

His courage and sense of duty ignited the cultivators' spirits. They followed him in a desperate counterattack, determined to reclaim the wall.

The Soul-Hooking Geckos turned their heads almost simultaneously and spat out their coiled tongues.

The geckos' tongues shot out with astonishing speed, their length equally astonishing.

In the blink of an eye, these tongues pierced through numerous cultivators.

The cultivators had no time to react as they fell one after another.

Some managed to withstand the onslaught with their defensive measures, but most were struck. As the tongues retracted, they yanked the cultivators' souls from their bodies.

The geckos' tongues retracted even faster than they had extended!

The cultivators' souls were reeled into the geckos' mouths.

The geckos snapped their jaws shut and swallowed them whole.

The soulless bodies collapsed to the ground. In this single assault, at least half the cultivators had perished.

The cultivators' morale shattered, their resolve crumbling.

The leader roared, "Keep charging!"

But only a handful followed him.

The rest scattered, fleeing in terror.

Ning Zhuo observed this scene from the shadows, unsurprised.

The leader and the few who still charged with him were all City Guard members. Though not formal cultivators, they were well-trained, loyal, and willing to fight, hailing from respectable families.

The others, however, were mostly villagers from the towns surrounding the Immortal City.

These villagers, lacking deep attachment to the Immortal City and having never experienced such brutal combat or undergone rigorous training, possessed unstable morale.

If not for the White Paper Immortal City's formidable defenses, these cultivators would have long since crumbled under the Ghost Tide, slaughtered into complete disarray.

The geckos opened their mouths again, launching a second volley of tongues.

The leader and several cultivators instantly fell, their eyes wide with bitter resentment.

Their souls were hooked and dragged into the geckos' bellies.

The Qing-Jiao Army, having just arrived, witnessed this gruesome scene.

"Something's wrong. These Soul-Hooking Geckos are far stronger than normal. What's going on?" Qing Yan frowned deeply.

He was about to halt and observe cautiously when Qing Chi, standing before him, roared with fury, "You vile beasts! Charge with me and avenge our comrades!"

Having been nurtured by the Military Seed program, their first military system was "Absolute Obedience to Orders". This made the fledgling army more inclined to follow their commander's commands.

Thus, upon hearing Qing Chi's rallying cry, they swarmed onto the city wall.

"I..." Qing Yan stared in disbelief.

Ning Zhuo, observing the battle from afar, exclaimed, "Qing Chi made the right choice!"

Having experienced countless battles himself, he had instinctively recognized this fleeting opportunity.

Sure enough, as the main force charged forward, only a few scattered Soul-Hooking Geckos reopened their mouths and shot out their tongues.

These tongues moved with blinding speed. Even though the cultivators were prepared, they couldn't react in time and had to rely on their own defenses to withstand the attacks.

The tongues struck their targets, but the soldiers merely staggered before continuing their advance.

The cultivators who had just been routed stared in disbelief. "What's happening? Their defenses are no better than ours!"

If they hadn't known that these Soul-Hooking Geckos were purely ghostly beings, inherently filled with hatred and murderous intent toward living beings from the Yang Realm, the observing cultivators might have suspected the geckos were holding back.

A glint flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes as he suddenly understood. "It's their constitution!"

"These soldiers have been nurtured by the Military Seed program. Their bodies and souls have been tempered toward becoming Paper Money Spirit Envoys, their foundations strengthened through multiple cycles of enhancement."

The military logistics were costly, but every penny was worth it!

The enhancement to the soldiers' foundation provided by the Military Seed was immense.

While their defensive techniques were only of average quality, their own foundation was far more robust than ordinary, rendering the Soul-Hooking Geckos' attacks almost completely ineffective.

"Hmm?!" Seeing this, the enemy general, who had been hiding in a corner, could no longer remain still and revealed himself.

Wandering Dao Field!

He unleashed his full power, activating his Dao Field to immediately deepen his influence over the battlefield on the city wall.

A hazy gray full moon materialized above the crowd.

Silver-gray threads, resembling jellyfish tentacles, floated in the air around the city wall, swaying gently.

The cultivators within the Dao Field felt their souls becoming light and ethereal, as if about to detach from their bodies.

Their instincts proved correct. Some of the cultivators who had previously retreated in disarray lost control, their souls flying out of their bodies in terror.

Qing Yan's eyes flashed with intense light. "The Wandering Ghost God!"

This was a renowned deity from the Underworld, with a history stretching back to ancient times. Its form was that of a gray full moon, surrounded by countless mica-like tentacles.

These silver-gray wandering threads, resembling mica tendrils, could easily extract souls. Ordinary methods proved largely ineffective against them, making them exceedingly troublesome.

However, within the White Paper Immortal City's walls, the city's defenses significantly suppressed the Wandering Dao Field's power, reducing its effectiveness to less than forty percent of its full potential.

"So that's it!" Ning Zhuo realized. "The Wandering Ghost General has been hiding here, launching covert attacks."

Ning Zhuo immediately recognized the enemy commander's identity.

After Sun Lingtong obtained Luo Si's approval, he had returned to the Yang Realm. Several days prior, he had concealed himself within the Underworld Army's encampment, accompanied by a small squad of ox cavalry.

His presence made gathering military intelligence both convenient and reliable.

The Wandering Ghost General, a devotee of the Wandering Ghost God, wielded the Wandering Dao Field. This field weakened the connection between souls and bodies within its boundaries, making separation easier. Furthermore, souls detached from their bodies moved far faster than usual.

It was precisely through his covert interference, influencing the battlefield, that the defending forces had fallen into the enemy's trap, leaving them helpless against the Soul-Hooking Geckos' assault.

The enhanced Dao Field immediately affected Qing Chi and the others. As they ran, many found their souls surging beyond their thighs and arms.

Qing Chi shouted, "Paper Armor Technique!"

The cultivators obeyed instantly, each casting the Paper Armor Technique.

Within moments, layers of talisman paper enveloped their bodies.

The protective effect of the Paper Armor was immediate. It restrained their souls while simultaneously repelling the Soul-Hooking Gecko's subsequent tongue strikes.

The Wandering Ghost General frowned.

The Paper Armor Technique itself wasn't rare, but the skill these cultivators displayed was remarkable. Truly advanced practitioners could mold the talisman paper into full-fledged armor, offering far greater protection.

Yet their version was rudimentary - mere sheets of talisman paper clinging to their bodies, visibly thin and fragile.

What astonished the Wandering Ghost General was the talisman paper's effectiveness in combat. It completely isolated them from the Dao Field's influence and even had enough residual power to block the gecko's tongue attacks.

This defied all logic!

Unless the Paper Armor Technique was particularly well-suited to these cultivators.

Cultivators' physical constitutions varied greatly, leading to significant differences in their affinity for certain spells. The same spell could manifest with vastly different power depending on the caster.

"But it's impossible for all these cultivators to be so compatible with the Paper Armor Technique! Unless..."

The Wandering Ghost General's heart sank. He hastily retrieved a Ghost Fan.

With rapid strokes, the Ghost Fan conjured a torrent of Yin wind.

The wind surged with overwhelming force, sweeping across the battlefield.

"What a massive Yin wind!"

"Retreat! This wind will kill us!"

The routed cultivators, their composure shattered, paled and scrambled backward.

Qing Chi and her forces, caught in the Yin wind's onslaught, found their momentum halted. As their formations threatened to crumble and morale wavered, Qing Chi roared, "Yin Crossing Technique!"

As the owner of the Military Seed and First General, she had naturally mastered both techniques.

Even those who hadn't learned the Yin Crossing Technique through the Military Seed had trained together to master it.

The Yin Crossing Technique enveloped the cultivators, instantly transforming the raging Yin wind into a gentle breeze.

Of course, this was merely the Qing-Jiao Army's perception. To outsiders, it appeared as though they had swiftly adapted to the yin wind, charging onward through the gale.

The Soul-Hooking Geckos, bloated from their feast, found their combat prowess severely diminished.

At this critical moment, Qing Chi led her newly formed army to the battlefield, arriving just in time to launch a devastating assault.

Their initial charge was like a scythe through wheat, instantly slaughtering the majority of the geckos. The cultivators then fought fiercely, mercilessly butchering the remaining creatures.

As the section of the city wall was about to be reclaimed by White Paper Immortal City, the Wandering Ghost General could no longer restrain himself and swooped down from the sky.

"Perfect timing!" Qing Chi's eyes blazed with fierce light as azure flames erupted around her. With a thunderous stomp, she surged toward the Wandering Ghost General.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Their fists and feet clashed in mid-air, unleashing thunderous booms that shook the entire battlefield.

The Wandering Ghost General retreated slightly and activated his Ghost Fan. Qing Chi countered by unleashing azure flames, sending forth blooming fist-flowers.

After three rounds of combat, neither gained the upper hand.

Seeing that the cultivators had already retaken the wall and were effortlessly slaughtering the Soul-Hooking Geckos attempting to climb it, the Wandering Ghost General realized the tide had turned and began to withdraw.

Sensing his retreat, Qing Chi immediately gave chase.

The Wandering Ghost General sneered, "You can't stop me."

His natural speed was astonishing, and he was confident he could retreat from the front lines. But before fleeing, he needed to dispel his Wandering Dao Field, which he had personally created.

However, just as he began to do so, the plaque above the western gate of White Paper Immortal City suddenly erupted with an otherworldly light, seizing control of the Dao Field.

Simultaneously, countless sheets of wallpaper flew from the city walls, each one a talisman.

The talismans swarmed like a swarm of bees, encircling the Wandering Ghost General completely.

Forced to fight defensively, the Wandering Ghost General unleashed a barrage of ghostly arts, intercepting the talisman assault with impressive ferocity.

"Die!" Qing Chi seized the opportunity. Having finished her preparations, she ignited her entire body with Azure Flame and crashed into the Wandering Ghost General like a blazing meteor.

The Wandering Ghost General chose to block the impact head-on. But the moment they collided, his expression twisted in horror, consumed by infinite regret.

Boom!

The Azure Flame meteor shattered his chest, tearing through his body and exiting from his back.

As death approached, the Wandering Ghost General twisted his head, glaring at Qing Chi. "You! This is military power enhancement!"

Though the new army was still in its infancy, it could already provide such enhancements.

Empowered by the military formation, Qing Chi's combat prowess soared, surpassing even that of the Wandering Ghost General.

"I refuse to accept this!" the Wandering Ghost General roared before disintegrating into ash.

Caught completely off guard by Qing Chi's sneak attack, he failed to utilize his speed advantage and died a humiliating death.

Only a Ghost Path Golden Core remained, hovering in mid-air.

Qing Chi, however, was too weak to retrieve it. She plummeted from the sky, the Azure Flame around her body rapidly dissipating as she collapsed into unconsciousness from exhaustion.

Qing Yan swiftly caught his daughter and assumed command of the Qing-Jiao Army.

The cultivators momentarily panicked before regaining their composure. They held their ground within the city walls, slaughtering the surrounding ghosts until they scattered in disarray.

"It's truly a cultivator army!"

"White Paper Immortal City's foundation is solid. They decisively revealed a trump card."

"But why is a Ghost Clan girl leading the army?"

The Qing-Jiao Army not only immediately reclaimed the city walls but also executed a Golden Core-level Ghost General, achieving the greatest victory in White Paper Immortal City's defense.

In a single battle, the Qing-Jiao Army, already the talk of White Paper Immortal City, became renowned throughout the entire Yin Tide Black Marsh Wetlands!
