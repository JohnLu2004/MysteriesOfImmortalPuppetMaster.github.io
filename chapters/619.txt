Chapter 619: Internal Traitor!

The yin wind had dissipated, but the sky over the Ghostly Black Marshlands remained gloomy.

The Ghost Tide had just receded, leaving White Paper Immortal City far from its former splendor. The city walls were now scarred, their pale surfaces riddled with cracks and craters.

Tie Guzheng, unable to conceal his exhaustion, gritted his teeth and dragged his wounded body through the ruins, directing his subordinates to prioritize repairing the fortifications and clearing the battlefield.

The damage extended beyond the walls; many buildings near the perimeter had also been destroyed.

The Ghost Tide's overwhelming assault had threatened the very heart of the city. The air reeked of burnt paper, the metallic stench of cultivator blood spilled on the ground, and the pervasive odor of death hung heavy over the corpses.

Multiple casualty camps had been established throughout the White Paper Immortal City, each overflowing with wounded.

Yet even securing a spot in these camps was a stroke of luck, as many cultivators had perished on the battlefield without even a chance for treatment.

Medical cultivators hurried between the wounded, their faces grim.

Normally, Qing Chi would have been a vital presence here.

Her Azure Flame healing techniques were renowned for their remarkable efficacy and swift results, making her a highly sought-after healer.

After each round of treatment, Qing Chi's prestige soared, her reputation growing steadily throughout the Immortal City.

But at this moment, she remained at Yang Sanyan's side.

Overseeing the scene was Zheng Shoumo, the Old Scholar of the Ink Pool.

"Lord Zheng, hurry! Someone's dying!" a cultivator cried out.

Zheng Shoumo rushed over to find the wounded soldier barely clinging to life. His armor was in tatters, and his left shoulder was a gruesome sight. The shoulder blade and collarbone were shattered, with jagged bone fragments piercing through flesh and skin, grotesquely exposed in the dim light.

Within the gaping wound lay clots of thick, blackened blood mixed with grayish-white bone fragments.

With each labored breath, frothy, foul blood seeped from the depths of the wound, trickling down his tattered clothing and soaking the stretcher beneath him.

His breathing had become as faint as a flickering candle in the wind.

Zheng Shoumo focused intently, then flipped his left hand to reveal a scroll made of a material neither silk nor paper, but a pale yellow jade tablet with a warm, lustrous glow.

He held the tablet in his palm, channeling spiritual energy into it to unleash a soft, amber radiance.

The light illuminated the space above the wounded soldier, revealing an article on cultivating inner peace and self-improvement.

Countless characters, bathed in the warm yellow light, flowed into the soldier's body.

The soldier's body stiffened momentarily, then relaxed. His tightly furrowed brow slowly smoothed out, and his wound began to heal at a visible pace.

After a moment, the injured soldier's tightly closed eyelids fluttered open, revealing a faint glimmer of life in his still-hazy eyes.

Having stabilized the soldier's condition, Zheng Shoumo immediately halted his treatment.

It wasn't that he was unwilling to continue, but rather that he needed to conserve his energy. With so many wounded soldiers, there were always others teetering on the brink of death, requiring urgent care.

He and a group of highly skilled cultivator-physicians were primarily responsible for intervening at critical moments, pulling patients back from the abyss of death.

"Lord Zheng, Lord Wen Ruanyu is waiting for you at the camp gate," a cultivator reported. "He requests a word with you."

Zheng Shoumo's eyes narrowed slightly, but his expression remained calm. He nodded. "I'll be quick."

Leaving the wounded soldiers behind, he approached the camp gate and found Wen Ruanyu standing with his hands clasped behind his back.

Wen Ruanyu slowly turned, and as he did, two other cultivators materialized: Ning Zhuo and Yang Sanyan.

The trio surrounded Zheng Shoumo, their combined presence imposing.

Simultaneously, the surrounding environment rapidly transformed. Within a few breaths, Zheng Shoumo found himself standing in a vast grassland.

The Grasshead Dao Field!

A flicker of surprise crossed Zheng Shoumo's face as he fixed his gaze on Yang Sanyan, the source of the Dao Field. "You must be Yang Sanyan of the Myriad Manifestations Sect."

"May I ask the purpose of your visit, Lord Yang?"

Yang Sanyan replied, "Someone has exposed your identity as an internal traitor, Zheng Shoumo."

Yang Sanyan turned to Ning Zhuo.

Zheng Shoumo glanced at Ning Zhuo before turning to Wen Ruanyu. "This is slander. Do you believe this as well, Lord Wen?"

Wen Ruanyu's expression was complex. With a sigh, he said, "Old Zheng, this is merely suspicion. We need to conduct a confrontation to verify the truth."

Zheng Shoumo then turned to Ning Zhuo. "Young friend Jiao Ma, I never expected our next meeting would be under such circumstances. Please tell this old man what I have done to cause such a grave misunderstanding."

Ning Zhuo's expression remained calm. "The mass poisoning of male consorts at Vigorous Yang Manor has shocked the entire city. I investigated the scene and felt something was amiss."

"It was only when I was alone that I realized what that unsettling feeling stemmed from."

"It was Yang Weida."

"When the other male consorts died, their faces were twisted in agony. But Yang Weida was different. His expression was serene, as if he hadn't experienced the pain of life slipping away."

"Why was that?"

Zheng Shoumo replied, "Perhaps the assassin acted too swiftly, sparing Yang Weida from suffering. His death might have been too quick."

Ning Zhuo shook his head. "There's a crucial piece missing here - how exactly did the male consorts die? The true cause of death for Yang Weida and the others was ultimately attributed to poisoned Spirit Food."

"And because of that, an innocent old man was forced to confess."

"We all know he's not the killer. So who is the real culprit, and how did they manage to poison so many male consorts?"

Zheng Shoumo's expression remained impassive. "Jiao Ma, if you haven't even figured out this basic question, coming to confront me seems rather hasty, don't you think?"

Ning Zhuo gave a wry smile. "I'm not as skilled as some others when it comes to solving cases. Truth be told, I'm not particularly good at it."

"My theory is that the killer has been carefully concealing their methods all along."

"Whether it's the recent mass poisoning of the male consorts or the earlier deaths of Shen Bing and Chen Sui, the true causes lie hidden beneath the surface."

"Initially, I thought the killer was fabricating false causes of death to frame others, sow discord, and disrupt order in the city."

"That might have been part of their motive, but I don't believe it was the primary one."

"The primary goal of the murderer is to disguise their true methods of assassination. These methods are highly distinctive, and if discovered, they could easily expose the culprit."

"If the assassination methods originated from a Confucian cultivator, it would be extremely difficult to detect. Confucian cultivators are exceedingly rare in this city. In fact, Lord Wen Ruanyu and Lord Zheng, you two are the only Confucian cultivators in the entire city."

Zheng Shoumo nodded. "That makes sense, but it's just a theory. How can you prove I'm the murderer?"

"And according to Jiao Ma, this confrontation isn't just directed at me, but at Lord Wen Ruanyu as well?"

Wen Ruanyu's eyes flickered slightly, but he remained silent.

Ning Zhuo stared intently at Zheng Shoumo, his gaze sharp. "Yang Weida's death is a flaw in the plan."

"If he, like the other cultivators, had been poisoned, his expression would undoubtedly have been one of agony and contortion."

"But it wasn't!"

"Either the murderer's usual methods were ineffective against him, forcing them to resort to an alternative, or their methods simply weren't potent enough to kill him."

"This makes me wonder, what truly sets Yang Weida apart from the other Male Consorts?"

"The most obvious difference is that he's an outsider!"

Zheng Shoumo remained expressionless.

Ning Zhuo continued, "But what fundamental difference exists between an outsider and a native of White Paper Immortal City?"

"There is one."

"The Ink Pool!"

Zheng Shoumo finally raised an eyebrow.

Ning Zhuo added, "I learned about the Ink Pool's profound influence on White Paper Immortal City from Senior Wen's teachings."

"The Ink Pool is a literary treasure of Confucian cultivators, born from the inkstone among the Four Treasures of the Study: brush, ink, paper, and inkstone. Its waters can enlighten the masses, washing away barbarity and violence, and guiding them toward the path of literature."

"Since its creation, the Ink Pool has been the primary source of drinking water for the entire White Paper Immortal City and surrounding villages."

"And Old Zheng, you've been its guardian. To maintain its daily operation, you've immersed yourself in the lives of the people, holding various positions within the Immortal City, wandering through alleys, and participating in countless aspects of daily life."

"As a Confucian cultivator, it would be trivially easy for you to tamper with the ink."

"The drinking water in this Immortal City is all ink. Even Spirit Food requires water. It's as if you've poisoned the entire city, scheming against everyone."

"You used the ink as a conduit, employing some Confucian cultivator technique to carry out precise assassinations..."

Zheng Shoumo scoffed. "Enough, Jiao Ma. This is all speculation. If you have concrete evidence, present it now. I'm burdened with important duties and have no time for your rambling. Do you realize that your delay could cost the lives of wounded soldiers?"

Yang Sanyan and Wen Ruanyu both turned to Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo spread his hands. "I have no evidence."

Yang Sanyan and Wen Ruanyu glared at him in unison.

Ning Zhuo stood tall, unfazed. "I told you, I'm no Divine Constable."

Yang Sanyan snorted. "Boy, I'm not here to play games with you."

Wen Ruanyu suggested, "Perhaps we should request the City Lord to use the Heart-Piercing Scroll."

Ning Zhuo shook his head. "It won't work."

"I suspect the City Lord already used the Heart-Piercing Scroll on all high-ranking officials during the previous investigation of the Internal Traitor."

"The internal traitor has yet to be uncovered. This leaves only two possibilities: either the traitor isn't among the high-ranking officials, or the Heart-Piercing Scroll is ineffective."

"The Heart-Piercing Scroll is a Confucian technique. Old Zheng may have relied on this very fact to pass every inspection unscathed."

Zheng Shoumo chuckled coldly. "I understand now. After all your talk, it's all just speculation. Do you realize you're falsely accusing the innocent?"

Ning Zhuo was about to retort when Wen Ruanyu suggested, "If Old Zheng tampered with the Ink Pool, I could investigate. With my Confucian cultivator methods, I can examine it for any suspicious traces."

Ning Zhuo shook his head. "Do you think Old Zheng wouldn't have anticipated that?"

"I recall, Lord Wen, you once told me that the Ink Pool has been repeatedly sabotaged over the years."

"You explained that the Ghostmen, being inherently yin spirits, resist external alteration by Confucian cultivators and thus resort to sabotage."

"I understand their motive, but what I can't comprehend is why their sabotage has succeeded so many times."

"The Ink Pool is vital to White Paper Immortal City. Shouldn't it be heavily guarded?"

Wen Ruanyu chuckled bitterly. "It's already heavily guarded, but the Ghostmen's sabotage is always so cunning. Sometimes they turn internal members against us, other times they devise ingenious methods - you wouldn't believe how miraculous their destructive techniques can be..."

As he spoke, Wen Ruanyu's expression shifted, and he paused abruptly. His pupils narrowed as he fixed his gaze on Zheng Shoumo.

He hadn't noticed it before, but now, upon reflection, he realized it was truly strange that such a critical facility as the Ink Pool could be repeatedly breached. And Zheng Shoumo, as its defender, must either be incompetent or somehow complicit.

But was Zheng Shoumo incompetent? Wen Ruanyu shook his head without hesitation. In many ways, Zheng Shoumo surpassed even a Golden Core cultivator like himself. For instance, his understanding of the Provisional Contract for Enlistment was so profound that Wen Ruanyu had willingly deferred to him in the matter of recruiting Ghost Generals, acknowledging Zheng Shoumo's superior expertise.

This was the golden age of Cultivation! In such a flourishing era, diverse cultivation techniques bloomed like a hundred flowers, each school vying for dominance. As Wen Ruanyu had explained to Ning Zhuo earlier, Confucian cultivators were a late-blooming sect. Their ability to claim a significant share of the cultivation landscape stemmed from their integration of numerous cultivation arts into their core practices.

Cultivation is only one measure of a cultivator's strength. Mastery of profound skills can often allow a cultivator with weaker cultivation to defeat an opponent with higher cultivation. Confucian cultivators, with their deep knowledge of the Four Arts of the Scholar (zither, chess, calligraphy, and painting) and various scholarly works, can achieve things that even Confucian cultivators with higher cultivation cannot.

If Zheng Shoumo could surpass Wen Ruanyu in the Provisional Contract for Enlistment, why couldn't he surpass him in other areas? It was entirely possible.

This realization dramatically changed Wen Ruanyu's perception of Zheng Shoumo.

Zheng Shoumo snorted coldly and demanded of Ning Zhuo, "Jiao Ma, do you have any evidence? You've been making baseless accusations from the start. Produce evidence or get out! Stop wasting my time with important matters."

Ning Zhuo replied impassively, "I've already said, I have no evidence."

Zheng Shoumo's eyebrows twitched, about to retort, but Ning Zhuo continued without pause, "I'm not some Divine Constable."

"But I am the Vice City Lord!"

"I don't concern myself with evidence when I act."

Zheng Shoumo's expression froze.

Wen Ruanyu frowned deeply, his expression hesitant.

Yang Sanyan, on the other hand, threw back his head and roared with laughter, clapping his hands. "Those words strike a chord with me! Zheng Shoumo, surrender now. The city won't miss you - just a few more dead cultivators. White Paper Immortal City is vast enough to absorb such losses. You overestimate your importance; we'll manage just fine without you!"

Zheng Shoumo's lips twitched as he glared at Ning Zhuo, as if wanting to curse but restraining himself for the sake of decorum.

Ning Zhuo's gaze seemed to pierce through hearts. He spoke slowly, "Old Zheng, if you're truly innocent, bind your own hands and let us seal you away for a time. But I suspect - heh heh heh - you might not be so willing."

Ning Zhuo's laughter at the end carried a weight of implication.

"What do you mean by that?" Wen Ruanyu's brow furrowed in confusion.

The fury on Zheng Shoumo's face vanished, leaving a blank mask. "Yes, I refuse."

Wen Ruanyu and Yang Sanyan exchanged startled glances, their eyes fixed on Zheng Shoumo.

Zheng Shoumo's words were deeply problematic, tantamount to an indirect admission of Ning Zhuo's accusations.

Yet the next moment, Zheng Shoumo declared bluntly, "Yes, I am the Internal Traitor you've been hunting all along."
