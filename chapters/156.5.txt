Chapter 156.5: Guessing Correctly Shows Your Skill (Author's Note)

I am an author who outlines my stories.

The first volume has been outlined from the start.

Looking at the big picture, the experiences and relationships between Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong fit better in the latter half of the story.

Thus, when readers encounter Ning Zhuo's seemingly awkward personality in the earlier parts, it's because key information has not been revealed yet.

In fact, the foreshadowing has already been set:

1.

Sun Lingtong possesses spiritual eyes, enabling him to see Sun Lie refining pills in the Purple Mansion Courtyard.

2.

After Ning Zhuo seeks his help, Sun Lingtong immediately aids him in framing Han Ming.

3.

The Retired Guest is well-treated in the black market, and when Ning Ze tried to recruit Ning Zhuo, he was framed by Sun Lingtong, resulting in a huge loss of spirit stones.

This was actually Sun Lingtong standing up for Ning Zhuo.

4.

Sun Lingtong calls the Retired Guest "brother," which is quite uncommon.

These points hint at the close relationship between Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong.

Of course, some readers have noticed this.

Logically analyzing these clues, the answer can indeed be inferred.

If you can deduce it, I think it adds another layer to the reading experience, which feels rewarding.

The outline is set and won't change.

Unlike in "Reverend Insanity," where I altered the plot when readers guessed it, "Mysteries of Immortal Puppet Master" will remain unchanged.

Partly because altering it doesn't necessarily improve the story, and partly because only a few readers can guess the plot.

It's like posing a riddle—if you solve it, you’re clever!

This is just a little game I'm playing with everyone.

This represents a shift in my mindset while writing this book. 

At chapter 137, we reach a minor climax, and I hope everyone enjoys it.

Writing about Yuan Dasheng and Yuan Yi is essentially writing about Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong.

The novel has a relatively complex structure, and I am good at creating such frameworks and planning long-term narratives.

So, the further you read, the more exciting it gets.

This is one of my small specialties in writing.

Regarding the recent updates and the difficulties in following the story, I'm thinking about how to improve.

I've already toned things down a lot.

Long-time readers of "Infinite Bloodcore" should understand this.

If the updates were more frequent, this issue wouldn't exist.

But friends, I've been working very hard.

The recent updates have generally exceeded 6000 words.

Don't forget, I'm quite slow at typing! 

Those who have been following my work can attest to this.

The current update situation is unprecedented for me, right?

The grand climax of the first volume will be at the end of this month or early next month.

I will adjust the outline structure for the second volume to improve the reading experience.

Thank you all for your guidance.

If you have good suggestions, you can leave me a message on WeChat.

QQ messages are also fine; I check them periodically.

I may not always reply since there are too many messages, but I will definitely take good suggestions into account.

I used to seclude myself in my inner world, creating behind closed doors, which led to some parts not aligning well with web novel reading habits. 

The so-called "coming out of the mountains" actually represents a change in mindset.

During the creation process of "Mysteries of Immortal Puppet Master" I will actively collect opinions and make improvements.

One of the purposes of this "coming out" approach is to improve the reading experience, making the early and middle stages more exciting and engaging.

Combined with my strengths in the later stages, this should help me make further progress.

Improvements in writing style will come last.

I'm rather clumsy and need to take things step by step, slowly.

I place great emphasis on logical consistency in my writing.

Regarding the identity of the Shadow Awakened, I've already laid several clues.

Hehe.

If you can guess it, kudos to you!

Lastly, I earnestly ask everyone to subscribe more.

If you're planning to read the book extensively, please consider enabling automatic subscription.

As for monthly tickets, if you find this book to your liking, please consider voting for it.

Thank you all for your support!

Additionally, there is only one Fang Yuan and only one Ning Zhuo.

On this point, I have kept my promise to you all.
