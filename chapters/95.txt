Chapter 95: Could It Be That Ning Zhuo Has an Innate Talent?!

“What’s wrong with you guys?” Ning Zhuo showed an expression of realizing that something was strange and asked in confusion.

Zheng Jian gave a dry laugh. “Little Brother Ning Zhuo, you might be thinking a bit too optimistically.”

Zhou Zhu nodded. “That’s right.”

Ning Xiaohui snorted coldly. “The Lava Immortal Palace was one of Three Schools Supreme Sage’s personal residences in the past. It’s no trivial place. Three Schools Supreme Sage was a Void Refining expert; how could the inheritance he left behind be so easy?

“It’s not bad to have some fighting spirit, but you’re like a frog at the bottom of a well, proud and unaware of the wider world.

“Don’t say such things again.”

Ning Zhuo let out a noise of acknowledgment and quickly nodded.

He had been closely observing everyone’s reactions.

The reason he had said that was to provoke Zheng Jian and Zhou Zhu, probing them for the Zhou and Zheng Clan’s next steps.

Unexpectedly, his comment stirred up painful memories of the past, becoming a heavy mental blow to the two prodigies.

Zheng Jian smiled bitterly. “Three Schools Supreme Sage’s trial really is difficult. Brother Ning Zhuo, don’t laugh at us for this – in truth, we couldn’t even pass the first level.”

“Huh?” Ning Zhuo’s eyes widened with visible surprise.

Among everyone present, Zheng Jian was the oldest. Moreover, he was straightforward by nature, and thus chose to directly admit to his failure.

In any case, Ning Zhuo would be entering the immortal palace soon, so there was no point in hiding it.

“What exactly is that first level, that even Respected Elder Brothers Zheng Jian and Zhou Zhu couldn’t pass?” Ning Zhuo asked.

Ning Xiaohui chuckled lightly. In her mind, she was thinking, “Zheng Jian worded it quite nicely. Actually, they never even got to see the first level in full.”

She herself had never entered the immortal palace. One reason was that she hadn’t been at the peak of the third level for long, and another was that she had a talisman guarding against soul extraction.

After the Ning Clan heard about the palace from the other two clans, they concluded that Ning Xiaohui wouldn’t be much use even if she went, so they decided to keep her in optimal condition and wait for the right moment.

Thus, Ning Xiaohui had never tasted failure in the palace and couldn’t empathize with Zheng Jian and Zhou Zhu in the slightest.

Seeing that Ning Zhuo was about to ask more, Zhou Zeshen quickly clapped his hands to interrupt. “Everyone, just eating and drinking is a bit dull, isn’t it?”

“Our Zhou Clan recently recruited a talented mechanical arts cultivator named Chu Xiyao[^1].

“Brother Zheng, she came along to this banquet as well and is currently waiting in the main hall.

“How about we invite her in and set up a little game for some entertainment?”

Zheng Jian gave Zhou Zeshen a deep look and nodded. “Since my worthy little brothers of the Zhou Clan have such intentions, of course I welcome it. Quickly invite that talented friend over.”

A moment later.

Chu Xiyao opened the door and entered, bowing and greeting everyone present.

She was a female cultivator with above average looks, and had a particularly charming temperament. Her brows drooped slightly, and combined with her melancholic expression and slender waist, her figure that was like a fragile willow swaying in the wind evoked deep pity.

She was clearly already in the Foundation Establishment stage, but her attitude toward the Qi Refining cultivators in the room was very respectful.

In the world of cultivation, strength commanded respect.

And in these circumstances especially, it wasn’t surprising.

After all, the gap between Foundation Establishment and Qi Refining wasn’t always insurmountable. Many situations presented the possibility of bridging the gap.

Moreover, they were all righteous path cultivators here, not demonic cultivators who always followed the law of the jungle.

Most of Chu Xiyao’s respect was directed at the talents that Zheng Jian and the others wielded.

As long as a cultivator possessed a spirit root, they could practice cultivation.

In ancient times, spirit roots were rare, and having one of any kind was enough to be venerated.

As time passed and the number of cultivators increased, people began respecting only the more excellent spirit roots.

And now, with spirit energy growing increasingly dense, spirit roots alone didn’t matter much. Only innate talents truly commanded respect.

Chu Xiyao had a spirit root, but no innate talent. In time, Zheng Jian and the others would easily surpass her cultivation base.

Thus, her respect was ultimately due to the principle of strength commanding respect.

The people here would one day become strong.

This was just like how some sects would immediately have new disciples with excellent innate talents be taken in as personal disciples of their higher-ups. Even if these disciples were only in Qi Refining, their status would be equivalent to elders and they would be honored throughout the entire sect.

Ning Xiaohui said in curiosity, “Senior Chu, this junior has long heard your esteemed name. My Ning Clan once tried to hire you at a generous price.

“At the time, you said that you disliked constraints and preferred freedom and turned us down.

“This junior is quite curious – what made you change your mind and join the Zhou Clan instead?”

Chu Xiyao sighed. “Isn’t it all because of that Zhu Xuanji?”

As a Foundation Establishment cultivator skilled in mechanical arts, Chu Xiyao actually met the criteria to enter the immortal palace and compete over the inheritance.

And she had indeed entered the immortal palace before. Although she suffered some injuries, she had also gained great benefits.

Zhu Xuanji had failed to catch the black shadow demonic cultivator during the Fire Persimmon Festival, and although he’d obtained some clues, he suspected that they were traps that the true culprit had deliberately left behind.

Thus, he visited the four major forces in Fire Persimmon Immortal City and compiled a list of suspects after looking through their records.

Starting from the top, he began investigating them one by one.

Li Leifeng was the first to be investigated.

Next was Zhao Die[^2], who resisted and ended up being killed by Zhu Xuanji.

Chu Xiyao knew that she was definitely also on the list. However, she had no intention of leaving Fire Persimmon Immortal City and still hoped for a chance to re-enter the immortal palace.

Thus, after much thought, she decided to temporarily take refuge with the Zhou Clan.

Why did she do that?

She had two main reasons.

The first was that she absolutely couldn’t choose the City Lord Mansion. The City Lord Mansion was under the control of the Southern Bean royal dynasty. Were Chu Xiyao to join them, she would have even less reason to resist Zhu Xuanji’s harsh investigation.

The second was that the three great clans offered far more flexible terms and were overall much more enticing. If Zhu Xuanji came to trouble her, although the three clans might not resist outright, they could still offer some degree of protection. At the very least, they could secretly leak the news and allow Chu Xiyao to escape on her own.

The three great clans were deeply rooted in Fire Persimmon Immortal City and placed great importance on their reputation.

After weighing everything, Chu Xiyao chose the strongest of the three clans, the Zhou Clan.

Ning Zhuo’s gaze flickered slightly.

Thanks to showing off a little, he had been allowed to participate in this private banquet. And now, he’d obtained his first valuable piece of intel tonight.

“Zhu Xuanji’s actions are driving cultivators to join up in groups?

“Some cultivators with relatively clean backgrounds will most likely choose to rely on the four major forces. But there are definitely some demonic cultivators who won’t dare to attach themselves to any group. These will either flee far away or band together. There shouldn’t be many fools who keep acting alone.

“Zhu Xuanji is checking every suspicious individual one by one. I wonder if my mother is on that list?”

Ning Zhuo once again felt pressure.

Chu Xiyao slapped her storage pouch and released a mechanism wooden box.

The box was a solid-looking cube. Once it landed on the ground, it quickly split apart and assembled its pieces into a rectangular maze board.

Ning Zhuo immediately saw that this board was modeled after Room 2.

Although Zhou Zhu and Zheng Jian always died instantly to the heavy hammer trap, they still managed to catch glimpses of Room 2’s layout through the doorway.

After dying enough times, they had managed to gather some useful intel.

Once the maze board was set up, Chu Xiyao took out game pieces and distributed them to Zheng Jian and the others.

Each game piece was also a small mechanical object. They were shaped like wheels, with spokes around a central axle.

“Isn’t this a miniature One Round?” Zheng Jian asked after examining the piece.

Chu Xiyao nodded. “Yes, these are One Rounds.”

One Round was a kind of mechanical toy that many children loved.

Children would pour their meager amounts of magical power into the One Round, then watch it spin autonomously. They competed to see whose One Round rolled the farthest.

The name One Round came from the inventor, who was extraordinarily weak. Any time he entered a competition, he would be eliminated in just one round.

Chu Xiyao continued, “These modified One Rounds don’t just absorb magical power. They can also store a certain amount of divine intent.

“Pour in both magical power and divine intent, then put the piece onto the maze board and see whose One Round travels the farthest.”

Zheng Jian was the first to act. The moment Chu Xiyao finished speaking, he tossed his piece onto the board.

His One Round moved rapidly through the maze, turning many times before finally hitting a wall and coming to a halt.

“Interesting.” Zheng Jian’s eyes gleamed. “It needs a great amount of both magical power and divine intent, and they have to coordinate precisely. Any slight mismatch will rapidly accumulate as time passes, ultimately leading to failure.”

Chu Xiyao smiled softly and immediately praised Zheng Jian for his sharp perception and accurate assessment.

After Zheng Jian took his turn, Zhou Zeshen, Zhou Zhu, and Ning Xiaohui each gave it a try.

Zhou Zhu’s piece traveled the shortest distance. Although Zhou Zeshen had the weakest cultivation base here, his piece went the farthest.

Ning Xiaohui’s One Round moved with a graceful and refined rhythm. The distance it covered was second only to Zhou Zeshen.

“It’s Brother Ning Zhuo’s turn now,” Zhou Zeshen said with a smile.

In an instant, many gazes turned toward Ning Zhuo.

Although Zhou Zeshen had called it entertainment, this was really a test. The world of cultivation always valued individual excellence.

Without a doubt, the next stage of internal competition among the three clans would revolve around those present at this banquet.

Most of the people here were already familiar with the others. But Ning Zhuo had risen too suddenly, Although the clans had gathered intel on him, he was still a relatively unknown factor.

At this moment, Ning Zhuo seemed oblivious of everyone’s attention. After throwing down his One Round, he stared at it closely with a tense expression on his face.

His One Round twisted and turned among the various obstacles, moving forward at a slow pace. It lacked Ning Xiaohui’s elegance and Zhou Zeshen’s precision, but steadily continued rolling and eventually stopped beyond everyone else, setting an unprecedented record.

“How could this be?” Zhou Zhu was stunned.

Zheng Jian and Zhou Zeshen both looked toward Ning Zhuo.

Even Ning Xiaohui showed a surprised expression and took another look at him.

Chu Xiyao’s beautiful eyes lit up. “It’s divine intent. This young master from Ning Clan has extremely abundant divine intent, which is unusual for a Qi Refining cultivator.

“Because of this, he could continue controlling the One Round for a long time.

“Moreover, he minimized the consumption of magical power, allowing his divine intent and magical power to cooperate for the longest possible duration. That’s why he ended up with the greatest performance.”

Ning Zhuo scratched his head. “That might be it. It’s true that I’ve always seemed to have more divine intent than my peers.”

“Could it be... an innate talent?” In that instant, the same question flashed across everyone’s mind.
