Chapter 73: The Demonic Cultivator’s Disappearance

Fire Persimmon Forest.

“Where’s that black shadow demonic cultivator? Where did he go!?” Chi Dun searched everywhere, along with the Golden Core cultivators of the three major clans.

Fei Si’s face was ashen. Having not expected this kind of outcome, there was nothing he could do but bark orders. “Search! Dig three chi into the ground if you have to! Find that damn demonic cultivator!”

Right in front of everyone, the black shadow demonic cultivator had vanished without a trace!

Fei Si was furious and humiliated.

He had utterly failed this mission!

Everyone in the city now knew that the City Lord Mansion had been played for fools. All that preparation and scheming, only to catch nothing in the end.

“This can’t be happening, it can’t!” Gnashing his teeth, Fei Si looked toward the distant Zhu Xuanji.

After a moment of thought, he took the initiative to fly toward the divine investigator.

Previously, Zhu Xuanji had humiliated Fei Si by forcing him to activate the formation and save Yuan Dasheng’s life. But right now, the disappearance of the black shadow demonic cultivator was a far more serious matter than Fei Si’s personal pride.

Fei Si knew well just how serious this situation was. He unhesitatingly set aside his grievances with Zhu Xuanji and forced a smile onto his face as he asked for guidance. "Sir Zhu, you were observing the entire time. Did your Golden Pupils see anything?"

Zhu Xuanji shook his head. “Nothing at all. If there was someone hiding, my Golden Pupils would have definitely noticed them, but there was nothing suspicious from beginning to end. I can only conclude that the black shadow demonic cultivator had already left Fire Persimmon Forest before all this began.”

Fei Si frowned deeply at these words and instinctively denied, "No, he’s definitely still here!"

Zhu Xuanji’s conclusion was extremely unfavorable for Fei Si.

He was the warden responsible for Fire Persimmon Forest, but the prisoner had escaped without a trace from under his very nose.

He’d gone to great lengths for this Fire Persimmon Festival and yet ended up with nothing to show. He had made a laughingstock of the entire City Lord Mansion.

Just then, Chi Dun flew over and rebuked him harshly. “Fei Si, if you hadn’t stopped me back then, I would have chased down that demonic cultivator and wiped him out that very night!

“You’re the one who kept going on about waiting, minimizing losses, keeping things calm. Well, look where that got us. The black shadow demonic cultivator has escaped! What exactly were you doing with Fire Persimmon Forest?”

Fei Si snorted coldly. “Everything else aside, at least the harvest was successful. You can’t deny that we managed to preserve the vast fortune of Fire Persimmon Forest.

“Anyway, the formation’s been up the whole time. We can just look at the records.

"If it turns out that the black shadow demonic cultivator really did escape due to my negligence, I’ll accept any punishment and personally confess my guilt to the City Lord."

At that moment, a Golden Core old ancestor from the Zhou Clan also flew in. "We will, of course, examine the formation records.”

The Zhou Clan old ancestor didn’t look very pleased.

Although the City Lord Mansion was the biggest target of mockery right now, the Golden Core cultivators of the three great clans had also achieved nothing, and their reputations were equally tarnished.

The Zhou Clan old ancestor continued, "The key issue now is whether the black shadow demonic cultivator escaped before the formation was activated, or slipped away right under our noses today.

"Based on my experience with formations, the Fire Persimmon Forest’s formation is extremely secure, especially since it’s integrated with the immortal city’s grand formation.

“If I were that black shadow demonic cultivator, even if I managed to crack the formation, I wouldn’t be able to avoid causing some commotion. Could a mere Golden Core cultivator really escape without a sound?”

For a moment, Fei Si, Zhu Xuanji, and Chi Dun all fell silent.

They had all thought of a terrifying possibility—

What if the black shadow demonic cultivator had already left beforehand? What if someone had secretly opened the formation to let them out?

The highest authority over the immortal city’s grand formation lay with the City Lord. As the one charged with guarding Fire Persimmon Forest, Fei Si had some control over it as well.

Moreover, the formation pillars of the immortal city grand formation were located inside the three major clans, meaning the three clans also had the means to manipulate the formation and secretly release the black shadow demonic cultivator.

In that case, the situation would be far more serious.

A single Golden Core demonic cultivator was one thing, but an entire cultivation clan was a completely different matter!

Zhu Xuanji glanced at the Zhou Clan’s old ancestor, thinking to himself, “It’s almost impossible that the City Lord Mansion did this. They don’t have a motive.

"As for the three clans, all of them are suspects.

"The City Lord Mansion has always been in the lead in the competition over the Lava Immortal Palace. The three clans definitely don’t want the Meng Clan to come settle in Fire Persimmon Immortal City once the immortal palace falls into the City Lord’s hands.

“If I assume that the culprit is one or more of the three clans, the Zhou Clan is the most suspicious.

“Formations Zhou, Artifacts Zheng, Talismans Ning. Of the three clans, the Zhou Clan is the most skilled in formations.”

However, the Zhou Clan old ancestor maintained a calm and open demeanor, saying, “Let’s first put aside the thought that the black shadow demonic cultivator escaped beforehand. There were several questionable incidents already during today’s fire persimmon harvest.”

"Exactly!" Chi Dun immediately nodded, understanding what the Zhou Clan old ancestor was referring to.

Previously, over a dozen mechanical monkeys suddenly went berserk, breaking free from the control of the Foundation Establishment cultivators and attacking the current gang leader of the Monkey Head Gang, Yuan Er.

This accident had occurred right in front of the Golden Core cultivators.

They held themselves back, but Fei Si decisively took action, unleashing dynamic formation skills to destroy all the mechanical monkeys.

The Zhou Clan old ancestor continued, "Why did those mechanical monkeys go berserk? Who was controlling them?

"After the mechanical monkeys were destroyed, the Monkey Head Gang’s old ape made a mistake and triggered an explosion in the thousand-year area.

“Was that really a mistake? Or was the old ape under the influence of some kind of spell or magic treasure?

"Could it be that the black shadow demonic cultivator drew our attention with the explosion and took the opportunity to run away?”

Fei Si immediately waved his hand, activating the formation and bringing up the recorded footage from that period of time.

The Golden Core cultivators watched the footage several times in a row but didn’t notice anything suspicious.

Fei Si said, “I will be conducting a thorough investigation into the reason the explosive fire monkeys suddenly went out of control.”

Zhu Xuanji added, “I was watching with my Golden Pupils the whole time. The old ape really did just make an error.”

Chi Dun frowned. "That’s strange. That old ape is the foundation of the Monkey Head Gang and has been harvesting fire persimmons for many years. In the beginning, it did make mistakes from time to time, but recently, it’s always completed its task flawlessly. Why would it suddenly slip up now?”

Fei Si considered this for a moment before responding, "Since it’s a living being, mistakes are inevitable. The Monkey Head Gang has been under heavy pressure lately, and Yuan Er was even ambushed not long ago. The old ape must have been unsettled. It’s reasonable to make a mistake under such circumstances.”

At this point, Fei Si thought of Ning Zhuo.

And right afterward, he thought of his forty percent share of the profits.

He was beginning to feel that this forty percent share was becoming a bit burdensome.

The Zhou Clan old ancestor suddenly said, "What if that black shadow demonic cultivator was hiding inside the old ape?

"Whether it was the mechanical monkeys suddenly going berserk or the old ape’s mistake, in the end everything led up to the chain explosion.

“While the flames were obscuring our vision, the black shadow demonic cultivator could have killed the old ape and hidden inside its body.”

As he spoke, the Zhou Clan old ancestor turned his gaze to Zhu Xuanji.

“This old man has one thing I don’t understand, and I’ll be so bold as to ask it here. Why did Sir Zhu save the old ape?”

For a moment, everyone else also turned their eyes toward Zhu Xuanji.

A flicker of schadenfreude flashed across Fei Si’s eyes.
