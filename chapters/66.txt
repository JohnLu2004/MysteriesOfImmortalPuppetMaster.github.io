Chapter 66: Critical Mistake

Yuan Er felt as if a massive boulder was pressing down on his heart, leaving him barely able to breathe.

After observing for a while, he was deeply aware of his current situation.

The mechanical monkeys were shockingly efficient, far better than his gang’s monkey pets.

Monkey pets would get tired and often acted overly cautiously due to fearing explosions. But mechanical monkeys never grew weary; the moment they were damaged, they could be sent back for emergency repairs and quickly return to the scene. More importantly, they had no fear at all, allowing them to act with great efficiency.

“We’ve fallen behind across the board. The thousand-year area of Fire Persimmon Forest is our last chance. Uncle Monkey, it’s all up to you now!” Yuan Er said.

Yuan Dasheng nodded and leapt into action.

It had been conserving its energy all this time, only making an appearance at this final critical moment.

Two muscular arms swept out seemingly carelessly from Yuan Dasheng’s hulking frame, leaving behind faint afterimages from their speed. But when the hands attached to these arms touched the fire persimmons, not a single explosion was triggered.

The Molten Flame Demonic Ape’s movements were swift and fluid as it plucked every thousand-year fire persimmon from one of the trees and placed them gently on the ground.

Its shocking performance drew the gazes of countless cultivators.

“This Molten Flame Demonic Ape is incredible!”

“Of course it is. It’s the very pillar of the Monkey Head Gang, a beast pet left behind by the former gang leader Yuan Yi.”

“How terrifying! Its movements are so casual, but not a single fire persimmon has exploded. Its martial skill is enough to put who-knows-how-many martial masters to shame.”

Yuan Dasheng displayed a perfect balance of strength and finesse, applying no more and no less than the exact force required every time. Thousand-year fire persimmons were even more volatile than the hundred- or ten-year ones, but in Yuan Dasheng’s hands, they were completely inert, almost as if they were fake persimmons.

The ape leapt from tree to tree, to the ground and back, its massive body moving gracefully. All who watched were captivated by the beauty of its carefree strength.

Halfway up the mountain, Chen Cha, Ning Zhuo, and the others also saw this scene through the projection formation.

Chen Cha showed a look of surprise. “No wonder the Monkey Head Gang has controlled the business of picking fire persimmons for so many years. They have genuine skill!”

“Yes, it’s very impressive,” Ning Zhuo said. “But unfortunately, they only have that one powerful ape.”

Chen Cha shook his head. “That’s not right. Take a look at our current performance; the mechanical monkeys are too low in quality and have caused many explosions.

“In the future, the City Lord Mansion will certainly rely on the mechanical monkeys for picking ordinary fire persimmons. The monkey pets are too inefficient and much more prone to error.

“But when it comes to thousand-year fire persimmons, they’ll have to rely on this Molten Flame Demonic Ape. Look at its swift movements, its calm and steady demeanor. It’s very reliable.”

Ning Zhuo didn’t respond, but a faint cold light appeared in his eyes.

He sneered silently in his heart. “Reliable, huh?

“I’ve been planning for this moment all along.

“Yuan Dasheng, it’s time for you to accept my gift.

“Now... die!”

The moment this thought flashed through his mind, more than a dozen mechanical monkeys suddenly went out of control and charged at Yuan Er.

The abrupt change in the situation left many in shock, but Yuan Er reacted immediately.

He’d been constantly on edge ever since the assassination attempt. Now that something was happening, he reacted like a startled rabbit diving into its burrow.

Mechanical monkeys charged him from three sides. The only open path for Yuan Er was to run straight ahead.

In his panic, he instinctively chose what he believed to be the safest direction.

He ran forward without hesitation, trying to reunite with Yuan Dasheng!

Yuan Dasheng reacted quickly and stopped picking fire persimmons to run toward Yuan Er.

They managed to safely meet up in the thousand-year area of Fire Persimmon Forest. As for the mechanical monkeys, they couldn’t follow.

Fei Si took action, activating a formation that immediately obliterated the explosive fire monkeys.

This was the thousand-year area of Fire Persimmon Forest!

It was the core area of the entire Fire Persimmon Forest, with unimaginable value. How could Fei Si possibly allow the mechanical monkeys to run rampant here?

“Is it the black shadow demonic cultivator stirring up trouble again? But why target the Monkey Head Gang?” Zhu Xuanji, Chi Dun, and some others were full of doubt. But the black shadow demonic cultivator hadn’t revealed themselves, so these Golden Core cultivators couldn’t make a move.

Fei Si’s expression darkened and his gaze flickered with suspicion. Was it possible that this wasn’t the black shadow demonic cultivator’s doing, but rather a scheme of Ning Zhuo?

“If it really is him, then that crazy brat Ning Zhuo must die!”

Fei Si held a bit of appreciation toward Ning Zhuo, but this matter involved his own duty and future. If Ning Zhuo was indeed the culprit, Fei Si would be the first to make him pay.

Fei Si immediately ordered for all the mechanical monkey fragments to be sent over to Chen Cha and Ning Zhuo, along with a personal message.

The messenger quickly arrived in front of Ning Zhuo, face expressionless and eyes cold. “Sir Fei Si sends these words: whoever ignores the bigger picture is asking to die!”

Chen Cha was dumbfounded.

Ning Zhuo’s expression turned extremely serious. “Please report to Sir Fei Si that I would never be so foolish! These mechanical monkeys can only be controlled with at least a Foundation Establishment-stage cultivation base. How could it be me?

“This must be a probe or act of sabotage by the black shadow demonic cultivator. I implore Sir Fei Si to investigate things carefully. There aren’t many repairs needed at this point; I request permission to temporarily withdraw to Fire Persimmon Immortal City so I can clear my name.”

Only now did Chen Cha understand what was happening, and he was instantly filled with indignation. He had to take a deep breath to barely suppress his anger before saying, “We would never sabotage the Monkey Head Gang for personal reasons, especially right in front of everyone!

“Moreover, how far away are we? Do you really think we could control those mechanical monkeys at this distance, without using any wires or divine sense?”

The messenger’s expression softened slightly. After nodding, he turned and left.

Chen Cha was still fuming. “What nonsense is this? The control component of those mechanical monkeys is a set of three stroll bullets. Only a Foundation Establishment cultivator can control them! But they’re suspecting you, Little Zhuo? Absurd, truly absurd!”

Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly. “You can’t really blame Sir Fei Si. He’s under immense pressure right now; only the thousand-year area of Fire Persimmon Forest remains unharvested, and the black shadow demonic cultivator still hasn’t made a move. The real event will probably start soon!”

…

Inside the thousand-year area of Fire Persimmon Forest.

Yuan Er was still trembling. “Uncle Dasheng, the Flying Disk Workshop is completely insane. The whole city is watching, but they still tried to take my life!”

Yuan Dasheng was also filled with anger, but it patted Yuan Er’s shoulder comfortingly to calm him down.

Fear lingered on Yuan Er’s face, but he suddenly became excited. “Uncle Dasheng, it must be because the Flying Disk Workshop saw you displaying your divine might and couldn’t sit still any longer. That’s why they took such a gamble!

“Uncle Dasheng, please keep it up! Continue picking fire persimmons and secure our victory!”

Yuan Dasheng nodded. It pointed at Yuan Er, then pointed at the ground.

Yuan Er understood and immediately nodded. “Don’t worry, Uncle Dasheng. I’ll stay near you.”

Yuan Dasheng turned around and resumed climbing trees to pick persimmons.

Its movements grew faster and faster, quickly returning to its earlier efficiency.

Up on the mountainside, the light in Ning Zhuo’s eyes reached its peak.

“Come on, come on,” he whispered silently in his heart.

Yuan Dasheng’s expression suddenly changed drastically!

Its fingers tightened, and it accidentally crushed a thousand-year fire persimmon.

It made a mistake.

At the critical moment, right before victory was secured.

It made a mistake!
