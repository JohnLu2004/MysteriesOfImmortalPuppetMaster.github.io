Chapter 623: Full-Scale Military Buildup

Outside White Paper Immortal City.

Underworld Army Barracks.

Sun Lingtong scanned the surroundings, transmitting every sight and sound through Life Hanging by a Thread to Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo "saw" massive numbers of Yin Soldiers applying a medicinal ointment.

The soldiers opened the ointment, then spread it evenly over their bodies.

As the ointment was applied, it often emitted the sounds of creatures' dying screams.

These sounds were absorbed into the Yin Soldiers' bodies, quickly dissipating.

Sun Lingtong provided a timely explanation: "I've inquired about this. This medicinal pill is called Death Echo Cascade Ointment."

"It's primarily made from Underworld Grass, Moonshadow Dew, and Ghost Flower Mud. Currently, the entire Yin Soldier army applies this ointment daily at fixed times."

"At first, the effects are negligible, but with repeated use, they accumulate. Eventually, the death echoes reshape the soul, forming a protective heavy armor effect."

Sun Lingtong added a crucial warning: "However, since this medicine temporarily alters the soul, once its effects wear off, it leaves the soul in extreme weakness. Without subsequent intake of other medicinal pills, it can cause severe aftereffects such as soul distortion, memory confusion, and loss of intelligence."

Ning Zhuo suddenly recalled the dangerous maneuver he had witnessed during the great battle in the Two Note Kingdom, where their army had increased their heavy armor at great risk.

Realizing the severity of the situation, he exclaimed, "So the Yin Soldier army is actively preparing for a decisive battle!"

"This Yin Soldier army initially stationed here was relatively small. But after enduring so many Ghost Tides, continuously absorbing ghostly creatures, and receiving reinforcements from the Forgetful River Prefecture, their numbers have now approached a hundred thousand!"

"If they launch a full-scale assault, can the White Paper Immortal City withstand it?"

Ning Zhuo felt immense pressure weighing on him.

Although he held the title of Vice City Lord, the White Paper City Lord had never truly delegated authority to him. Therefore, Ning Zhuo remained completely unaware of the White Paper Immortal City's true capabilities.

At most, he knew that the Paper Giant possessed Nascent Soul-level combat strength.

"The true key to this great battle lies not in the White Paper Immortal City, but in the Forgetful River Prefecture!"

Due to Meng Yaoyin's arrangements, Ning Zhuo had access to comprehensive intelligence. However, he had not revealed details about the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual or the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-long scheme.

Keeping these secrets intact did not hinder the White Paper City Lord, Yang Sanyan, Wen Ruanyu, and others from actively preparing their defenses.

Sun Lingtong asked, "Little Zhuo, we don't have much time left."

"How is the Qing-Jiao Army holding up?"

"Can you guarantee they'll have the courage to charge into the Underworld at the final moment, fighting to the death?"

"Even if you've used Life Hanging by a Thread to control Qing Chi, though this young lady has won the soldiers' hearts, can she order the Qing-Jiao Army to risk their lives in battle?"

Ning Zhuo sighed. "We need to plan this carefully."

He severed his connection with Sun Lingtong, pondered briefly, then summoned Qing Chi.

Upon hearing Ning Zhuo wished to see her, Qing Chi's face lit up with delight as she hurried to his residence.

"Little Ma, have you missed me?" Qing Chi greeted him with her usual enthusiasm. "You're always either cultivating or busy with the City Lord's affairs."

"Now that you've uncovered the Internal Traitor, you can finally rest properly. I'll keep you company, and we can do whatever we like!" Her eyes burned with passion.

Ning Zhuo's scalp began tingling with unease.

He cleared his throat. "Miss Qing Chi, although we've identified an Internal Traitor, we didn't capture him alive. That means we can't obtain crucial intelligence."

"We don't know if there are other traitors lurking."

"In these circumstances, it's best to maintain our previous caution and vigilance. We shouldn't let our guard down."

"Moreover, the enemy forces outside the city now number nearly a hundred thousand. With White Paper Immortal City's situation critical, we can't afford to relax our guard!"

Qing Chi, though deeply fond of Jiao Ma, understood the bigger picture. She sighed, "Thanks to you, Little Ma, we secured the Myriad Manifestations Sect's investment. Now that we've cleared the Military Logistics hurdle, we have two foundational principles for the Military System in place."

"When I grasp the third principle, we can advance to the next stage."

"Once we perfect our weaponry, the Qing-Jiao Army will be officially established."

"It's a pity we're still a step behind. Had we formed our army earlier, we could have struck while the enemy was first establishing their camp. We might have even annihilated them then."

"Now they've not only secured their position but grown in numbers. If the Qing-Jiao Army were to engage them outside the city walls, it would be certain death!"

Ning Zhuo pondered silently, holding a different perspective on this matter.

"This may well be the evolution of the Yang Heaven's fate."

"Yang Heaven intends to mete out divine punishment upon the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord, hence all these preparations."

"According to the Ash Bone Elder's plan, the Qing-Jiao Army is precisely the weapon meant to confront the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord!"

"Under normal circumstances, establishing a new army would be too difficult. Not only would resources be required, but all factions would need to reach consensus. White Paper Immortal City possesses substantial wealth, so why hasn't it established a cultivation army yet?"

Having spent considerable time here, Ning Zhuo gradually came to understand the deeper political dynamics at play.

"If this is Heaven's arrangement, then I must bring the Qing-Jiao Army to its destined stage."

"However, before that, I must do everything to strengthen this army."

"I believe Yang Heaven chose me as the savior precisely because of what I possess."

"Since that's the case, I'll follow Heaven's will."

Ning Zhuo had long made up his mind. With this thought, he produced a helmet.

Qing Chi immediately cast a curious gaze upon it. The helmet was half-spherical with a wide faceplate, its top slightly curved backward like a phoenix about to spread its wings. Its bronze hue bore numerous scratches and dents - clear marks of battle.

"Ah, this is military equipment!" Qing Chi exclaimed in surprise.

"Though military systems come first, military equipment is the next step."

"But receiving this now is too early."

The ghost girl then gazed tenderly at Ning Zhuo. "Little Ma, I knew you loved me. You've prepared so many treasures for me. Though this military equipment is damaged, I still cherish it."

"Thank you!"

Ning Zhuo's expression turned solemn. "Miss Qing Chi, you misunderstand. This military equipment isn't a gift. It's merely on loan for your use."

"It's a component of the Ancient Shared - Battle Armor."

The Ghostmen girl: ?

Seeing her puzzled look, Ning Zhuo realized she knew nothing about the Ancient Shared - Battle Armor and proceeded to explain in detail.

Qing Chi couldn't help but examine the helmet again. "So it's actually a treasure. But if it's so prestigious, what use is it to us?"

Ning Zhuo replied, "You'll need to combine it with this."

Qing Chi watched as the youth produced a book.

This book was made entirely of metal.

On its cover stood four bold characters - Gao Sheng's Posthumous Writings - each stroke vigorous and forceful. The sight alone felt like a raging storm, radiating an indescribable pressure.

"A military manual?" Qing Chi's eyes lit up. "I've read many manuals before. They're not difficult at all."

She curiously took hold of Gao Sheng's Posthumous Writings, flipped through a few pages, then asked in confusion, "Aiya, this book is too damaged. The contents aren't complete at all."

Ning Zhuo smiled faintly. "These two items must be used together. Try it - the effect should be remarkable."

Long ago, Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong had used these two treasures. One had comprehended the Light Body Swift Wind Formation, while the other had grasped the Hero's Return Technique.

Ning Zhuo, recognizing Qing Chi's innate talent as a Military Strategist, believed she would gain even greater insights.

Qing Chi nodded. "Alright, Little Ma, I'll follow your guidance. Teach me how to use them."

After some instruction, Qing Chi donned the Ancient Shared - Battle Armor, channeled her divine sense into the Military Manual, and closed her eyes in deep contemplation.

Observing from the side, Ning Zhuo soon noticed something peculiar. Both the Ancient Shared - Battle Armor and Gao Sheng's Posthumous Writings began to glow, resonating with the Military Seed within Qing Chi's body!

The three radiant energies merged into a single luminous stream, shining brightly for the duration of an incense stick's burn before simultaneously fading away.

"Did you gain any insights?" Ning Zhuo asked as soon as Qing Chi slowly opened her eyes.

Seeing Ning Zhuo's concerned expression, a warm current flowed through Qing Chi's heart. She eagerly exclaimed, "I've comprehended two military strategies! One is called Money-Communicating Ghost, and the other is Life-Buying Coin."

Ning Zhuo was momentarily surprised but quickly accepted this development. He had always anticipated Qing Chi's exceptional talent in military arts, and now it proved true - she was indeed extraordinary!

"Explain them in detail," Ning Zhuo pressed.

Qing Chi, holding nothing back from her beloved, immediately revealed the full details of both strategies.

The military strategy Money-Communicating Ghost could consume military funds to recruit a batch of ghostly creatures as soldiers, supplementing the Qing-Jiao Army's ranks.

The military strategy Life-Buying Coin would expend military funds to create a powerful healing force, curing the entire army.

"Both of these are remarkably practical!" Ning Zhuo nodded, feeling both delight and bewilderment. "But why are they both tied to military funds?"

Qing Chi scratched her head, embarrassed. "Perhaps I've been too influenced by the recent expenses of building the army. Such vast resources - even if I worked for hundreds of lifetimes, I couldn't possibly earn that much!"

Ning Zhuo looked at Qing Chi, his admiration plain. "You possess extraordinary talent as a Military Strategist. Miss Qing Chi, you mustn't underestimate yourself. Your future achievements will undoubtedly be great."

Qing Chi was so delighted she nearly jumped up. "Little Ma, you believe in me that much? Haha, I knew it! You want to nurture me into greatness, then take me far away with you someday, right?"

Ning Zhuo coughed twice, denying it firmly. "Not at all."

"Enough with the distractions."

"Do you remember the spell the Qing-Jiao Army mastered - Human-Ghost Visage?"

With the support of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, the Military Seed had steadily advanced. The entire Qing-Jiao Army had been trained by the Military Seed, subsequently mastering numerous spells.

Among these techniques was one called Human-Ghost Visage. When activated, this spell allowed soldiers to temporarily transform into either a pure human form or a ghostly one.

In human form, they became members of the Human Race. In ghost form, they became ghostly creatures!

Ning Zhuo observed, "Your recent study of military strategy has been heavily influenced by the Military Seed. I recommend immediate specialized training to master these two strategies as soon as possible. This will greatly benefit the Qing-Jiao Army and save many lives in future battles."

Half of the Qing-Jiao Army members were related to Qing Chi by blood or marriage.

Hearing this, Qing Chi grew solemn. "I will practice diligently!"

Ning Zhuo then approached the City Lord, requesting access to her Cultivation Chamber. He sought to utilize the temporal development within to accelerate Qing Chi's practical training.

On the third day, Qing Chi rushed excitedly to Ning Zhuo's residence.

"Little Ma, I've comprehended a third Military System!"

Just as she spoke, her stomach grumbled audibly.

Ning Zhuo, who was eating, chuckled at the sound. "Have you eaten? If not, let's eat together while we discuss."

Qing Chi had been training relentlessly, day and night, striving to master the two military strategies as soon as possible. This would allow her to save the lives of one or two family members during combat.

She truly hadn't eaten yet.

She immediately sat down and took a few bites of food. "Pah! Pah! Pah!"

Qing Chi spat it out immediately. "What is this? Is it even food for humans?"

Ning Zhuo shook his head solemnly. "The taste might not be great, but it enhances your foundation. Do you know how much that mouthful you just spat out was worth?"

When Ning Zhuo gave the number, Qing Chi's face paled. She stared at the Spirit Food with wide eyes. "I was wrong. I shouldn't have wasted it. I'll eat it—no matter how bitter, I can handle it!"

With a twisted expression, Qing Chi swallowed the Spirit Food, experiencing both pain and a strange sense of satisfaction.

These Spirit Foods were highly effective yet incredibly unpalatable, crafted by the Spirit Chef Elder of the Dark Cuisine School.

It turned out that when the Spirit Chef Elder had initially agreed to the City Lord Clone's request to confess and use his life to stabilize the citizens' morale, Ning Zhuo had later uncovered the Internal Traitor, indirectly saving the elder's life.

After learning of this, the elder immediately sought out Ning Zhuo, expressing his desire to repay this life-saving grace by offering his humble services.

Ning Zhuo arranged for the elder to prepare Spirit Foods for him.

While they ate, Ning Zhuo asked Qing Chi about the third Military System.

Qing Chi answered, "It's called 'Father and Son on the Battlefield'!"

Ning Zhuo immediately understood what had triggered Qing Chi's realization of this principle.

Qing Chi, single-mindedly focused on mastering the previous two military strategies, had come to deeply understand that the Qing-Jiao Army consisted of two main groups: the Ghost Clan Qing Family and the Human Jiao Clan. Regardless of which clan, Qing Chi felt a sense of familial connection to both.

From this, they had grasped the third military system: "On the battlefield, father and son fight as one."

Now they had collected all three military systems:

Strict discipline with swift execution.
A single year's training equals ten years' accumulation.
Father and son fight as one.

These three military systems formed the foundational style of the Qing-Jiao Army.

First, their military discipline was strict.

Second, their military funding was substantial.

Third, they were bound by familial ties.

After establishing the army, they could continue adding more military systems. But with these three in place, they could proceed to the next phase.

"It's time to prepare our military equipment," Ning Zhuo said, standing up.

Qing Chi asked, "Aren't you going to eat?"

Ning Zhuo shook his head. "I was just sampling. This food is all for the Qing-Jiao Army."

"I'll go find some supporters right away. Maybe we can get some funding to help us through the military equipment phase."

"Even though there are more stages after this, they're all just about building a strong and elite army."

"Once we finish preparing our military equipment, establishing the army will be complete!"

Qing Chi was surprised again. Looking at the table full of spirit food, she said, "Are we really going to give all this spirit food to our Qing-Jiao Army? Isn't that too extravagant?"

Ning Zhuo shook his head.

When it came to the final battle, this was nothing. Moreover, Ning Zhuo had already obtained the approval of the White Paper City Lord and the Spirit Chef Elder.

The spirit food was prepared by the Spirit Chef Elder, and the meal expenses were covered by the White Paper City Lord.

Ning Zhuo had simply been responsible for persuading both of them earlier.
