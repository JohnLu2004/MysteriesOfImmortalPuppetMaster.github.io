Chapter 362: Exchange of Enlightenment Diagrams

At the Origin Mountain, the martial practice grounds.

Ning Zhuo was drenched in sweat, gasping for breath, and waved at Lin Shanshan, signaling that he needed a break.

Lin Shanshan halted her attack, took out a bottle of medicinal wine, and handed it to Ning Zhuo.

Since rumors had started circulating, Lin Shanshan stopped using the martial practice grounds at Little Contention Peak. To avoid gossip, she requested Ning Zhuo to secretly come to Origin Mountain and use the training grounds that her father often used.

This martial practice ground was not only of a high standard but also rarely visited, making it the perfect place to teach martial arts.

"What is this?" Ning Zhuo asked in confusion, reaching out to take the medicinal wine.

Lin Shanshan explained, "This is Warm Autumn Wine."

"The main ingredients are Chidragon Fruit, Sunflower, and Heavenly Dew. It has powerful nourishing and warming effects on the body and will definitely clear the cold energy in you."

Ning Zhuo clicked his tongue in surprise: "This is Golden Core-level medicinal wine; it will surely expel the bitter cold from my body."

"This is too valuable!"

"Did someone return from Fire Persimmon Immortal City? Has your sect finally uncovered the truth?"

Lin Shanshan shook her head: "The disciples sent out have not yet returned. I personally requested this from the elders of the sect in my own name."

"From my own heart, I believe in you, Young Master Ning Zhuo."

"But from the perspective of the sect, we must have concrete evidence and reliable intelligence. Otherwise, even if my father were to act alone, it wouldn't be the best way to lead the sect."

"I understand," Ning Zhuo sighed, "Leading a sect is really about leading people. If you are too overbearing, even if your intentions are good, you'll lose people's hearts. Those in power should be kind and compassionate, governing like a spring breeze that nourishes all in silence — that is the right way."

Lin Shanshan's eyes lit up and she praised, "Young Master Ning Zhuo, your words sound just like my father's teachings. Maybe, in the future, the two of you will have much to talk about."

Ning Zhuo quickly expressed that he had long heard of Lin Bufan's reputation, and upon moving to Little Contention Peak Peak, he witnessed the flourishing scene in Medicine Valley, which showed Lin Bufan's remarkable governance. He was deeply impressed.

"I know Lord Lin Bufan is incredibly busy, and it’s nearly impossible for someone like me to meet him."

"I only hope that during the discussions about cooperation between the two clans, I might have the chance to meet Lord Lin. That would truly be wonderful!"

Ning Zhuo very much wanted to leave a good impression on Lin Bufan.

After all, in the future, he would likely propose a deal involving the exchange of the Spiritual Boat of Fetal Breaths.

Although he knew this would be incredibly difficult, at the very least, he needed to meet Lin Bufan, talk with him, and determine whether this option held any hope.

Lin Shanshan said, "Since Young Master Ning Zhuo wishes to challenge Chang Yan soon, it would be best to fully expel the cold energy and recover completely to increase your chances of victory."

"Based on the distance and the days, the sect members should be reporting back any day now."

"If you, young master, can't defeat Chang Yan, you might miss the upcoming alliance talks."

"I’m giving you this wine not just as a friend but also to secure more benefits for my sect."

"In comparison to the alliance between our two factions, what’s a little Warm Autumn Wine?"

Lin Shanshan gently persuaded Ning Zhuo to accept the medicinal wine, her words both tactful and reasonable.

Ning Zhuo nodded, "Miss Lin, you're right." He removed the cork and looked inside. The Warm Autumn Wine was amber-gold in color, clear as the warm autumn sun, and gave off a subtle herbal and fruity fragrance that was deeply refreshing.

Ning Zhuo transmitted a message telepathically, "Boss, stay alert, I’m going to drink it." Sun Lingtong nodded and responded telepathically, indicating she was watching closely.

Ning Zhuo immediately lifted the bottle and took a sip.

The wine was warm and smooth when it first entered his mouth, with a hint of sweetness and coolness, like a mountain spring flowing down his throat.

Moments later, a strong warmth rose from his throat, quickly spreading throughout his body. The warmth, like spring sunshine, penetrated layer by layer, driving out the cold within, making him feel as if he were basking in warm sunlight—comfortable beyond comparison.

The bitter cold in Ning Zhuo's body was swiftly expelled as the effects of the wine spread.

Not only that, but the tension in his muscles and meridians from the earlier intense training also dissipated.

"Good wine," Ning Zhuo praised.

Lin Shanshan, feeling touched, was moved. After some thought, she said, "Young Master Ning Zhuo, when you travel in the future, be cautious about consuming foreign substances."

"At the very least, you should inspect them first."

"My father has always taught me that the martial world is dangerous, and people’s hearts are hard to read..."

Ning Zhuo nodded, "If it were someone else, I’d inspect it, but with you, Miss Lin, I trust you."

Lin Shanshan couldn't help but smile and gently shook her head.

Ning Zhuo stretched his limbs, "After a sip of this medicinal wine, my fatigue is gone. Let’s continue, Miss Lin."

Lin Shanshan replied softly, "Alright."

The two continued their sparring session.

Ning Zhuo focused all his attention on the training, his every thought on how to fight and counter Lin Shanshan.

Gifted with innate wisdom, Ning Zhuo was extraordinarily intelligent. Compared to the intricate art of mechanical engineering, martial arts were much simpler and more straightforward.

As a result, Ning Zhuo made rapid progress.

Initially, Lin Shanshan had the upper hand throughout the fight. Gradually, however, Ning Zhuo began to mount occasional counterattacks. Now, his counterattacks were becoming more frequent, and his defensive posture more stable.

Lin Shanshan was secretly amazed by Ning Zhuo's sharpness, and a growing sense of inferiority welled up within her.

When Ning Zhuo reached his physical limits, the two paused again.

During their rest, Lin Shanshan proactively offered advice regarding Ning Zhuo's next opponent: "Chang Yan is a demon cultivator, his true form being a soil snake. He’s not poisonous, but he excels in earth-based magic."

"If you want to increase your chances of winning, you must find a way to exploit wood-element techniques."

In the cycle of the Five Elements, fire creates earth, and wood counters earth.

Using fire magic to counter earth magic would be inefficient, but using wood magic would be far more effective.

Lin Shanshan continued, "From watching your previous battles, I've noticed that while your Five Element magic is powerful, it seems to lean more toward creation and crafting than combat. Is that correct?"

Ning Zhuo rubbed his nose, "Miss Lin, you have sharp eyes. You've already figured it out."

"My cultivation techniques come from the Lava Immortal Palace, primarily meant for crafting mechanisms."

"Using them in combat is not really their strong suit."

Hearing that Ning Zhuo’s techniques came from the Lava Immortal Palace stirred something within Lin Shanshan’s heart, causing her to be filled with curiosity and thoughts, but prying into others' cultivation techniques was impolite, so she suppressed her curiosity and continued the previous conversation. 

"In that case, Young Master Ning Zhuo, why not learn some of the wood-element techniques from our Myriad Medicine Sect sect?"

In the realm of the Five Elements, the Myriad Medicine Sect naturally excelled in wood-element techniques. While many of their wood-element techniques were focused on planting, alchemy, or healing, the vast collection also included many wood-element techniques that leaned more toward combat.

Ning Zhuo thought for a moment and said, "My challenge against Chang Yan is in just a few days. If I were to learn other wood-element techniques, I’d have to modify them to suit my style. It's nearly impossible to succeed in such a short time."

"So, Miss Lin, are you suggesting that I study your sect’s cultivation diagrams?"

Lin Shanshan nodded, immediately feeling the relief and ease that comes from talking to a smart person who understands quickly.

"That's exactly what I mean," she replied.

"In Myriad Medicine Sect, we have 27 wood-element cultivation diagrams."

"Twelve of them are linked to our sect’s core three techniques, so they cannot be shown to outsiders. But the remaining fifteen are open for you to observe and comprehend."

"However, with limited time, I suggest selecting three from those fifteen to begin with, and then focusing on one. That way, you might succeed."

She paused for a moment and added, "Normally, no one would make such preparations, but your comprehension is extraordinary, and there’s a real chance of success."

Ning Zhuo touched his nose, feeling like Lin Shanshan had more confidence in him than he had in himself.

In fact, Ning Zhuo had encountered cultivation diagrams before.

He still carried the "Ling Frost" and "Proud Snow" diagrams from the Ning family, but despite his efforts to comprehend them, he had not succeeded. He had stared at them for hours with no clue on how to decipher them.

"Wouldn't it be embarrassing if I couldn’t comprehend the wood-element diagrams this time?"

Despite this concern, Ning Zhuo agreed immediately.

This was an opportunity being presented to him, and as the saying goes, "One who rejects Heaven’s gift brings disaster upon themselves."

Lin Shanshan had already prepared a jade slip and handed it to Ning Zhuo.

He scanned the jade slip with his spiritual sense and carefully selected three wood-element diagrams from the fifteen.

After a moment, he made his decision: "I'll choose these three."

With that, after their special training for the day, Lin Shanshan led Ning Zhuo to the library.

She presented her token to the elder guarding the library.

The elder, with a weathered and frail appearance, said, "According to the sect’s rules, Shanshan, you are indeed allowed to bring someone to the top floor, but you may only take one book."

Lin Shanshan led Ning Zhuo up to the top floor and retrieved the "Ancient Tree Rooting Diagram."

After descending and completing the registration, Lin Shanshan took Ning Zhuo to visit her second senior brother to borrow the "Listening to the Waves at Night in the Mountains Diagram."

Finally, they arrived at the back gate of her home.

"Please wait here for a moment, Young Master. I’ll be right back," Lin Shanshan said before heading inside to see her father, Lin Bufan.

Unfortunately, Lin Bufan was not home.

Lin Shanshan entered her father’s study, searched for a while, and found the "Peeking at the Sky Beneath the Tree Diagram" on the bookshelf.

Shortly after, Ning Zhuo and Lin Shanshan both left Origin Mountain and headed toward Little Contention Peak Peak.

Ning Zhuo held three wood-element cultivation diagrams and also took out his family's "Ling Frost Diagram" and "Proud Snow Diagram." 

Lin Shanshan was a bit surprised, "So, Young Master Ning, you also have cultivation diagrams with you?"

Ning Zhuo replied, "I'm ashamed to admit it, but these are treasures passed down through my family. I've been carrying them with me, hoping to comprehend them one day. But ever since I left home, I’ve rarely had the time."

He continued, "Let me offer these two diagrams as collateral and leave them with you for now, Miss Lin."

Lin Shanshan immediately declined, refusing to accept the diagrams.

Ning Zhuo was momentarily taken aback and quickly said with a laugh, "Ah, I misspoke, didn’t I?"

"Fellow Daoist Lin, with our mutual sparring and exchange of ideas, we’ve grown excited and have exchanged cultivation diagrams. This is a sign of the growing collaboration between our two families."

Only then did Lin Shanshan smile and reach out to accept the two Ning family cultivation diagrams.
