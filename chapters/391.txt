Chapter 391: Zhu Xuanji: What's This Ominous Feeling?

Ning Jiufan took a deep breath and approached the Spirit-Concealing Willow. He walked around the tree several times, spreading his spiritual sense through the tree and soil.

"The soil is fertile and well-watered, but the Spirit-Concealing Willow seems like an elderly tree near death, unable to absorb nutrients anymore," Ning Jiufan identified the problem.

Ning Zhuo nodded with a sigh: "Exactly, it's too weak. Ancestor, do you have any good solutions?"

Ning Jiufan spread his hands: "This is a Golden Core level spirit plant. Your ancestor's knowledge of spirit plants is too shallow to risk tampering with it."

Ning Zhuo frowned immediately.

Ning Jiufan continued: "But that's not a problem. We have the most suitable person right beside us!"

"I remember that Sect Leader Lin Bufan is very skilled in cultivation and healing, though his alchemy could use some work."

"With his Nascent Soul level cultivation, treating a Golden Core level spirit plant should be quite safe."

Ning Zhuo sighed: "But this way, our clan's alliance contract with the Wanyao Gate will become even more stringent."

Ning Jiufan shook his head: "If we can heal the Spirit-Concealing Willow, any price is worth it."

Ning Zhuo shook his head and sighed again: "It's not just the Spirit-Concealing Willow."

"I also need to acquire the recipe for a wine called the Meditative Brew."

Ning Jiufan asked: "Why is that?"

"Last time, didn't I ask Sect Leader Lin Bufan for permission to visit Linghu Jiu? There..."

Ning Zhuo didn't hide anything and briefly recounted his drinking contest with Ling Hu Jiu in the Ten Thousand Demons Cave.

Ning Jiufan's eyes lit up again: "The Five Elements Divine Lord’s 'Five Viscera Temple Spirit Technique'?!"

"You had one drinking session and obtained a technique at the Void Refinement level?!"

"You should know that our clan's Ice Heart Technique is only at the Nascent Soul level."

Ning Jiufan was extremely excited at this moment, even more than when he learned about the Spirit-Concealing Willow.

Ning Zhuo quickly raised his palm to gesture downward: "Calm down, calm down, Ancestor."

"It's not like I haven't obtained Void Refinement level techniques before."

Ning Jiufan thought for a moment, but remained excited: "But your Three Sect Master’s Supreme Technique is only at the Foundation Building level. The 'Five Viscera Temple Spirit Technique' is complete!"

"How about it? Have you considered changing your cultivation technique?"

Ning Jiufan asked the same question as Linghu Jiu.

Ning Zhuo shook his head and gave his previous answer. On one hand, the Three Ancestral Supreme Technique suited him better. On the other hand, he believed it was a newer technique and superior to old methods like the 'Five Viscera Temple Spirit Technique'.

One aspect of this superiority was the dantian.

The Three Ancestral Supreme Technique cultivated three dantians simultaneously, which was world-class. The 'Five Viscera Temple Spirit Technique' focused on qi channels, affecting only the upper and lower dantians.

Ning Jiufan frowned and said worriedly: "Have you considered that the Three Ancestral Supreme Technique created by the Three Supreme Ancestors might not reach the Void Refinement level?"

"Also, you obtained the Foundation Building chapter from the Transmission Bell in the Lava Immortal Palace. Getting the subsequent parts might be impossible without going through Meng Kui. After all, he is the palace master of the Lava Immortal Palace."

Ning Zhuo nodded: "That's why I decided to take a gamble."

"That's why I'm cooperating closely with the royal family, forming a tight alliance, planning for the future."

Of course, Ning Zhuo wouldn't reveal that he actually had more control over the Magma Immortal Palace than Meng Kui. The Dragon Fire Spirit in the Dragon Head Cabin was the key to his future reclamation of the Lava Immortal Palace.

According to his plan, letting the Lava Immortal Palace go to Meng Kui now was just using the Meng family's power to help maintain it.

If he had inherited the palace at that time, he would've been stuck in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, not only unable to move freely but also having to endure revenge from both the Meng family and the Southern Bean royal family.

Another troublesome point was that Ning Zhuo wasn't a lone wolf - he had a family and subordinates. They were all in Fire Fruit Immortal City, and it would be too easy for Meng Kui, as the city lord, to cause trouble for Ning Zhuo through them.

Sometimes, taking a step back truly opens up new horizons!

Currently, Ning Zhuo could focus on key points and travel widely. So far, although he had only stayed in Fog Concealing Mountain and Ten Thousand Medicines Sect, the benefits had been enormous.

"If I had insisted on keeping the Lava Immortal Palace then, I'd probably be begging everyone now for funds to maintain the palace, agreeing to all sorts of unfavorable conditions."

Seeing Ning Zhuo's determined mind, Ning Jiufan could only say: "You're gambling with your cultivation path. Once you lose, there's no turning back."

"Old methods can be improved into new ones. Didn't your Five Elements realm advance?"

"If you really want to gamble, I advise you to wait a bit before advancing to Golden Core. Go back to the Lava Immortal Palace and check the Transmission Bell. It would be best if you could find out the limit of the Three Sect’s Supreme Method."

Ning Zhuo shook his head: "Since the last time the Transmission Bell rang and only taught me the Foundation Building chapter, that area has been turned into a restricted zone by Meng Kui."

"Accessing the Transmission Bell won't be easy."

"Fundamentally, it depends on me, on our Ning family's strength!"

Ning Jiufan nodded repeatedly, greatly approving: "Well said. Since you understand the stakes, I won't try to persuade you anymore."

"But is the Meditative Brew really that good?"

Ning Jiufan expressed his doubts: "Actually, there are many treasures with similar functions for communicating with the netherworld. For example, the Legacy Stone, Prayer Drum, Ghost Painting Slip, Ghost Face Book Slip, Ferry Yang Paper Crafts, etc."

"Speaking of which, spells are more convenient. For instance, the classic Ghost Possession technique, as well as Netherworld Soul Summon, Dead Soul Inquiry, Yellow Springs Ferry Spirit technique, etc."

"In my estimation, that Meditative Brew was specifically sought by Lin Bufan for his senior disciple. After all, Linghu Jiu has the Drunk Moon Seeking Immortal talent."

"Your amazing reward was just luck, a one-time hit!"

"It might not happen again."

"Didn't Ling Hu Jiu give you half a jar of Meditative Brew? Drink some more and see the effect."

"If it doesn't work, there's no need to add this to our list."

"If you really want to obtain such inheritance, the Book Collection Sect would work. As long as you can pay enough, they can even arrange for the original author to personally teach you the technique, impart the true meaning, and bypass the personal comprehension barrier."

At this point, Ning Jiufan paused: "Oh, right."

"Sometimes your ancestors might also receive teachings from the previous generations."

"During this year's festival, during the clan's grand sacrifice, you'd better return. I will personally oversee it, mainly for your matters, reporting to our clan members in the netherworld."

"At that time, there will surely be benefits for you!"

Ning Jiufan was indeed experienced and mature, giving very pertinent advice.

Ning Zhuo indicated that he had remembered everything and would try drinking the Yousi Mingniang again.

But he felt uneasy: "The Spirit-Concealing Willow is an inheritance treasure. Isn't it a bit inappropriate to show it to Lin Bufan?"

"If Grandma Xi was healthy and we had Nascent Soul level combat power, it might be more secure."

"But now, Grandma Xi also needs Lin Bufan's treatment, and the previous negotiations have revealed our true situation to him..."

Ning Jiufan smiled and shook his head: "No need to worry about this."

"The Ten Thousand Medicine Sect’s assets are far greater than our Ning family's. If he moves against us, how can he still maintain his righteous path status?"

"The Golden Core level Spirit-Concealing Willow is very important to our clan. To the Ten Thousand Medicine Sect, although they would want it too, if he really did this, wouldn't he be risking his entire foundation?"

"Unless he could deceive heaven and earth, with strong backing to cover up this matter."

"But as far as I know, Lin Bufan hasn't even caught the attention of the Southern Bean Nation's upper echelons yet. Our Ning family only lucked into royal support because of the Lava Immortal Palace."

"The Ten Thousand Medicine Sect’s foundation is large, but compared to the entire Southern Bean Nation, compared to behemoths like the Meng family and Su family, it's still far behind."

"If necessary, I will reveal my position as an official of the Southern Bean Kingdom. Ning Zhuo, you should also send a letter to Zhu Xuanji and trick him into replying, let Lin Bufan see that too."

"This way, I feel it would be very secure!"

This suggestion from Ning Jiufan immediately made Ning Zhuo give a thumbs up, praising: "Brilliant, Ancestor, you're truly brilliant!"

Ning Jiufan stroked his beard, smiled with satisfaction, and recalled: "I don't believe Sect Leader Lin Bufan would be someone who abandons righteousness for profit."

"Years ago, our Ning family's entire migration team crossed the underground dark river and came out from the Ten Thousand Demons Cave."

"Lin Bufan personally came to the scene, and after hearing our clan's experience, immediately arranged proper accommodation for us."

"We originally didn't want to continue troubling them, but seeing our clan's migration and difficult situation, Lin Bufan actually kept us for over a month, letting us rest and recuperate."

"That wasn't easy to do."

"On one hand, all this cost quite a bit of money. On the other hand, our Ning family's clan migration represented considerable strength. The Ten Thousand Medicine Sect’s accommodating such a large group of us involved taking many risks."

"Since Sect Leader Lin Bufan has such capacity and vision, he shouldn't trouble us just because he sees the Spirit-Concealing Willow."

Unlike Ning Zhuo, Ning Jiufan had many interactions with Lin Bufan in the past. Therefore, Ning Jiufan always had a good impression of Lin Bufan.

Ning Zhuo nodded and asked Ning Jiufan if he knew about the Five Elements Divine Lord.

Ning Jiufan said directly: he hadn't heard of it.

He then speculated: this title was grand and quite domineering. Since it was at the Void Refinement level, it shouldn't be unknown. A careful investigation should reveal the truth.

Ning Jiufan then suggested: "Wait, don't we need a reply from Zhu Xuanji?"

"You might as well write to him and ask about the Five Elements Divine Lord."

"The most basic function of the Southern Bean Nation's Divine Capture Department is to catch wind of things. Their archives and records are far more extensive than our clan's or Wanyao Gate's."

The old ginger is indeed spicier.

Ning Jiufan's suggestions were all excellent, and Ning Zhuo immediately nodded, accepting them all!

Divine Inspection Division, Headquarters.

Along the way, people kept greeting Zhu Xuanji.

"Are there any major cases today?" Zhu Xuanji asked.

"No," someone answered.

"Is that so?" Zhu Xuanji expressed doubt, "Whenever there's a major case, my heart slightly jumps, feeling somewhat uneasy. No major cases occurred today?"

The Divine Inspection Division member immediately checked through today's intelligence reports again, confirming there were none.

"That's strange." Zhu Xuanji touched his forehead, feeling puzzled, "What's this ominous feeling lingering in my heart?"

"Oh, right, Sir Zhu, there's an urgent document for you." As Zhu Xuanji was about to leave, the Divine Inspection Division member immediately called him back.

For some reason, Zhu Xuanji's heart skipped a beat.

The ominous feeling grew stronger at this moment.

"What letter? Who sent it to me?" Zhu Xuanji took the letter envelope and saw the signature—

Ning Zhuo!

This disaster-bringing child again!!

He immediately drew a cold breath internally.
