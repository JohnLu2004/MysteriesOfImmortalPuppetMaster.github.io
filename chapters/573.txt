Chapter 573: Lonely Star Wanders

Thus, Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong secretly revised their previous plan, joining the group of cultivators heading toward White Paper City.

Within the Ghostly Black Marshlands, waterways were abundant and intricate. The three redwood warships carried many people, who were all locals that were familiar with the environment, which made their journey smooth and uneventful throughout the day.

Ning Zhuo hadn't yet learned the Ghost Tribe leader's full name, only knowing his surname was Qing from overhearing others. Coupled with the leader's pale green complexion, it seemed rather fitting.

Since Leader Qing had already made arrangements, Ning Zhuo was placed directly under his care. Qing suggested Ning Zhuo use the Bone-chilling Crocodile stomach bag to recuperate, offering to personally protect him.

But Ning Zhuo wanted none of that.

His appearance and physique were easily disguised through his thieving skills, but his soul wasn't as malleable. Using the crocodile's stomach required separating the soul from the body to enter the bag. Doing so would surely expose him, and leaving his physical body unattended posed significant danger.

Yet this small obstacle didn't trouble Ning Zhuo.

He kept a stern expression, addressing the Golden Core leader by surname alone, clearly showing a reluctant obedience beneath a facade of subservience.

"Leader Qing, once we reach White Paper City, I'll naturally use the stomach bag to rest. There's no need for you to trouble yourself so much on my behalf."

Ironically, the Golden Core Ghost Tribe leader felt reassured, chuckling knowingly, "Jia Ma, don't think I don't understand your thoughts. You're still thinking about my daughter and afraid you'll owe me a favor that's tough to repay."

"Hmph."

"You're a human, and my daughter is of the Ghost Tribe. A union between you two would hardly lead to happiness."

"And what's wrong with becoming a male consort? If you become the City Lord’s husband, wealth and power would come effortlessly."

The Ghost Tribe Golden Core didn't miss a chance to persuade Ning Zhuo.

Beside him, Sun Lingtong struggled to hold back laughter, chiming in mockingly, "Indeed, Young Master Jia Ma. Becoming a male consort is a rare opportunity that others can't even dream of."

Ning Zhuo snorted coldly, pointing sharply at Sun Lingtong, "Who are you again? Even if you've saved me, I'm talking to Leader Qing. Who permitted you to interrupt? Slap yourself!"

Sun Lingtong froze on the spot.

Although the Ghost Tribe's numbers in the Ghostly Black Marshlands surpassed those of humans, their status remained inferior.

In the broader cultivation world, humans unquestionably dominated. The Ghost Tribe was sparse, significant only within this marshland.

Therefore, Ning Zhuo, as a human, ordering a Ghost Tribe Foundation Establishment cultivator to slap himself wasn't out of place.

Leader Qing's eyes flickered subtly but said nothing.

Suddenly, a dozen gazes landed on Sun Lingtong.

Gritting his teeth, Sun Lingtong glared at Ning Zhuo, prepared to strike himself when Ning Zhuo raised a hand to stop him. "But who am I?"

"I am Jia Ma, magnanimous and open-minded, not like some who hold petty biases between humans and ghosts."

Leader Qing chuckled softly, understanding Ning Zhuo was indirectly mocking him. Remembering Ning Zhuo's pursuit of his daughter, Qing chose not to retaliate.

Ning Zhuo pointed again at Sun Lingtong, "Since you've saved me, I'll show forgiveness this once."

"How about this: given your short stature and dark complexion, like a lump of iron, why not change your name to Iron Lump?"

"I'll accept you as my servant. From now on, you’ll work under me!"

Sun Lingtong resisted the strong urge to roll his eyes, inwardly thinking, "Fine, if that's how we're playing, then alright."

Obediently kneeling halfway, he clasped his fists respectfully, calling Ning Zhuo "Master."

Ning Zhuo laughed heartily, beckoning, "Come here, stand beside me. Await my orders."

"Yes, Master." Sun Lingtong ground his teeth in hidden resentment.

He hadn’t expected Ning Zhuo to be so audacious as to demand servitude from him. This was absolute rebellion!

"The old Ning Zhuo would never behave like this. Travelling around has really emboldened him. Joining that battle unleashed his wild side! Hmph, just you wait. Once I find the chance, I'll definitely settle the score!" Sun Lingtong had mocked Ning Zhuo earlier but was now trapped in this ironic reversal, helpless to resist for the time being.

Yet, Sun Lingtong knew Ning Zhuo's true intention was to position him nearby for easier coordination of their future actions.

Seeing Ning Zhuo successfully subdue a Ghost Tribe member, Leader Qing extended his spiritual sense, scanning Sun Lingtong thoroughly.

“Having a mid-stage Foundation Establishment ghost cultivator as your servant is acceptable,” Elder Qing nodded slightly. “Though, he's a bit too poor.”

With that, he produced two magical artifacts and tossed them to Sun Lingtong.

“These were my personal artifacts in my youth; you can use them now. One is the Flying Bone Shield, the other is the Malevolent Soul Saber. One for attack, one for defense - perfect for your use.”

“Refine them first, then I'll teach you how to wield them properly.”

Seeing Ning Zhuo was unwilling to accept favors directly, Elder Qing cleverly went around the issue, enhancing the strength of Ning Zhuo's supposed "servant," Iron Lump.

Sun Lingtong paused momentarily, inwardly marveling, “This little rascal Ning Zhuo really knows how to read people far better than I do.”

He quickly caught the artifacts, expressing his gratitude loudly.

Ning Zhuo snorted lightly, showing some hesitation, but ultimately did not object.

As the others sailed onward, Elder Qing personally assisted Sun Lingtong in rapidly refining the two artifacts and instructed him on their use.

With his sharp mind and extensive experience from countless thefts, Sun Lingtong swiftly mastered these ghost-path artifacts, wielding them adeptly.

Impressed, Elder Qing reassessed Sun Lingtong anew, remarking, “You're a clever one despite your shabby looks, little runt. From now on, serve your young master loyally, understood?”

“Yes, sir,” Sun Lingtong grunted quietly.

“Elder Qing Yan,” a man's voice suddenly called out, “I, surnamed Yang, am an outsider who happened to receive your village’s appointment quota, selected as a male concubine. Shouldn't Elder Qing Yan reward me with something too?”

Everyone turned to look. The speaker was a sturdy, towering middle-aged man, broad-faced with a lion-like nose, a full beard, and a chest thick with black hair, exuding strong masculine energy.

Only then did Ning Zhuo learn Elder Qing’s full name: Qing Yan.

Elder Qing Yan eyed the man, unperturbed, laughing loudly. “You're an outsider but willingly chose to become a male concubine, indeed contributing to our village. Tell me what you desire; I'll consider it.”

This middle-aged man's full name was Yang Weida, a body cultivator and merchant from Flying Cloud Kingdom.

Hearing about the recruitment of male concubines and believing his cultivation to be outstanding, Yang Weida sought higher connections. After surviving an attack through his own skills, he witnessed Qing Yan favoring Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong; therefore, his merchant instincts prompted him to boldly request rewards.

Outwardly straightforward yet inwardly shrewd, Yang Weida promptly requested a Bone-Chilling Crocodile Stomach Pouch like Ning Zhuo’s.

Elder Qing Yan scoffed coldly, “Your appetite is too large. A pouch from a Golden Core-level beast isn’t something given away casually. Ask for something practical.”

Yang Weida quickly responded, “Then I request a few Soul-Ferrying Lamp Wicks.”

Elder Qing Yan withdrew six artifact-grade Soul-Ferrying Lamp Wicks from his storage bag and tossed them to Yang Weida.

A chilling laugh suddenly echoed, “Just a few lamp wicks and you get an outsider willing to die for you. Qing Yan, you'd make a good merchant - quite the profitable deal!”

“Who goes there?!” Qing Yan stood abruptly, sharply demanding.

The others tensed, instantly alert.

The river exploded upward, revealing a Golden Core-level Bone-Chilling Crocodile, atop which sat an enormous elephant-sized human cultivator.

This man, entirely encased in bone armor with a chilling, ruthless gaze, stared at the cultivators aboard the three ships. “White Paper City Lord demands vast amounts of Yang energy. Selecting male concubines serves her dual-cultivation practice, endlessly supplying her with Yang energy.”

“As a result, becoming her male concubine will drain your life force excessively, ultimately costing your lives.”

“You fools chosen as male concubines, still feeling proud? Pathetic! You're digging your own graves.”

Many cultivators paled.

Ning Zhuo’s eyes deepened thoughtfully. Yang Weida, his expression shifting slightly, retorted, “I don’t believe you! If true, the White Paper City Lord would have long faced universal outrage and rebellion. Even without rebellion, everyone would’ve fled long ago. Yet she’s repeatedly selected male concubines for many cycles.”

His argument, logical and convincing, prompted Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong to reconsider him carefully.

Qing Yan snorted coldly, “Bone Crocodile Demon! Were you behind the recent crocodile attack on my village?”

The Bone Crocodile Demon openly admitted, “Indeed. I despise greedy idiots like you.”

“White Paper City Lord reigns over us - by what right?”

“You blind fools willingly give her vast amounts of Yang energy, sustaining her cultivation. That's why White Paper City stands unshakeable!”

“Our City Overthrow Alliance aims to eliminate you degenerates, purifying and liberating the Ghostly Black Marshlands!”

At his declaration, countless Bone-Chilling Crocodiles rose from the river depths, assaulting the three ships.

Immediately, the Redwood warships activated their protective arrays, glowing brightly to repel the attack.

The cultivators aboard the ships unleashed a torrent of spells, striking ferociously at the Piercing Bone Crocodile horde and the Bone Crocodile Demon.

Under the relentless magical assault, the crocodiles suffered immense casualties.

Some crocodiles hurled themselves against the ships, while others spewed corrosive venom from their gaping mouths.

The Bone Crocodile Demon roared with laughter amidst the fierce barrage. Clad in robust, heavy bone armor, he remained unscathed.

"Is this the best you can do? Feels like you're tickling me," mocked the demon.

"Is that so?" Qing Yan sneered, abruptly striking.

He summoned a gigantic soul blade, its energy surging and swelling to the size of the warships, slamming down fiercely from midair onto the Bone Crocodile Demon.

Boom!

Unable to withstand such overwhelming force, the Bone Crocodile Demon was thrown into the river, creating massive waves several meters high.

Undeterred, the Bone Crocodile Demon launched counterattacks from beneath the water.

Qing Yan pressed his advantage aggressively, his dominating strikes consistently forcing the Bone Crocodile Demon into defensive positions.

Meanwhile, the remaining Piercing Bone Crocodiles fell rapidly under the collective assault of the other cultivators, their corpses floating lifelessly on the water.

Although the Bone Crocodile Demon was a Golden Core cultivator, his strength lay primarily in beast control rather than personal combat prowess. Qing Yan's relentless attacks left him overwhelmed and defensively reactive.

Initially, the crocodile swarm had seemed to hold the upper hand against the cultivators, but the three sturdy redwood battleships, acting like mobile fortresses, rendered their assaults largely ineffective.

Later into the battle, Qing Yan gave a sharp cry and dove straight into the water, confronting the Bone Crocodile Demon directly.

Explosions continuously erupted from beneath the water's surface, creating massive, towering sprays.

Enraged, the Bone Crocodile Demon's voice echoed, "Qing Yan, you foolish loyal dog! What has the White Paper City Lord given you that makes you so devoted to her?"

Qing Yan responded coldly, "Your Overturning Alliance is short-sighted! Without the White Paper City Lord guarding the Immortal City and resisting the annual Ghost Tide, how could we survive here? Protecting the City Lord means preserving our lives and safeguarding the entirety of Ghostly Black Marshland's order!"

The Bone Crocodile Demon sneered, "You speak well, but you're just thinking of yourself. Have you considered the fate of those selected as male consorts? They have become nothing but cultivation sacrifices for the White Paper City Lord!"

"Stop your slander!" Qing Yan shouted angrily. "Becoming a male consort grants wealth and honor. The City Lord has never harmed innocents. Those unable to provide Yang energy simply leave; she never restricts their freedom. Your Overturning Alliance only seeks power and dominance but lacks the strength to resist the Ghost Tide. Given your pathetic skills, it's clear your whole alliance amounts to nothing!"

The Bone Crocodile Demon exploded with fury, "You dare insult me? Qing Yan, today I'll tear you apart and teach you the true strength of your Grandpa Crocodile Demon!"

Underwater explosions intensified, growing louder and more frequent.

Yet, after a fierce round of clashes, the explosions significantly diminished.

Qing Yan’s voice resonated once more, confident and defiant, "Crocodile Demon, if you have any tricks left, now's the time to use them."

"Damn it!" roared the demon, clearly disadvantaged.

He sneered coldly, "Qing Yan, you don't understand the City Lord's true state. I'll tell you plainly - she's finished. Even if she takes new male consorts, their Yang energy won't be enough to balance her condition. She's ruled White Paper City too long, accumulating excessive Yin energy. This time, your defeat is inevitable!"

Meanwhile, at Black Water Mountain, within White Paper City.

In the dimly lit Whisper Pavilion, only the Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer was present, sitting solemnly. In front of her, on a jade desk, lay several treasures - a bronze lamp, seven yellow jade bells, and a charred-tailed ghost-patterned zither.

She extended her hand, lighting a long incense stick with the bronze lamp. Blue smoke curled upwards, swirling persistently in the air.

Guided by her spiritual consciousness, she plucked the zither. The music merged with the swirling smoke, its patterns shifting rapidly. As the seven jade bells hovered and chimed harmoniously, the divination entered its most critical phase.

Gradually, the sorrowful melody faded away. The smoke descended upon the table, forming a thin layer of gray ash. The ashes subtly outlined a prophetic poem.

The Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer, breathing lightly and focusing intently, softly recited:

"Ghost tides surge, White Paper in peril,
A lone goose carries a candle, piercing heaven’s veil.
The guest star appears in the north of the literary pivot,
Myriad Forms Lamp ignites, shattering calamity."

She quickly formed hand signs, interpreting the prophecy further.

Her breathing weakened, but her eyes shone brighter with clarity. "The turning point lies in the north. The 'lone goose' and 'guest star' represent outsiders. An outsider with a candle who ignites the Myriad Forms Lamp will be key to overcoming this crisis!"

"Myriad Forms... Is this referring to a lamp, or the Myriad Forms Sect?"

After deep thought, inspiration suddenly struck her. She dispatched a flying message: "Wen Ruanyu, you are from the Myriad Forms Sect and a crucial figure in this prophecy. Go north immediately and greet an outsider. Remember, he carries some form of candle - perhaps literal, or simply candlelight or flame."
