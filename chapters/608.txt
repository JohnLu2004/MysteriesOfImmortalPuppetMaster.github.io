Chapter 608: Flesh Is Frail... Ascend through Mechanisms!

“Hahahaha!” Sun Lingtong let out a loud, uninhibited laugh in the Underworld.

After leaving Water Burial Valley, he continued his journey in search of Luo Si. Along the way, he reconnected with Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo didn’t hide anything from him. He explained in full the major discovery he had made, which sent Sun Lingtong into a fit of laughter atop his ox.

Ning Zhuo was speechless.

Once Sun Lingtong finally calmed down, he sighed. “Boss, it’s not really about me and Qing Chi. That’s not the point. What really made my scalp crawl was the situation itself.”

“Think about it - I only just decided to buy Burden-Bearing Tactics not long ago. But when I handed it to Qing Chi, it looked like I had planned the whole thing just for her!”

“Is this what they call the Way of Fate? If so, it’s downright terrifying.”

Sun Lingtong grinned wide, still chuckling. “Personally, I think it’s fascinating - damn entertaining, even!”

“After this, I’ve come to a realization: the unseen forces of fate are the true treasures of the world.”

“Just imagine - if we could steal someone else’s fate and make it our own, how wonderful would that be?”

“We’d always be lucky. Everything would go our way. Just like how Qing Chi’s army-building is going without a hitch!”

Ning Zhuo’s expression remained grim. “That’s not what I meant, Boss.”

Sun Lingtong laughed. “Of course I know what you mean.”

“You’re wondering if we’re just pawns - pieces moved by Heaven’s hand. That maybe your choice to buy Burden-Bearing Tactics wasn’t your own, but something arranged by Heaven from the start?”

Ning Zhuo nodded. “Exactly, Boss. What if everything we’ve experienced was scripted from the beginning?”

“We’re like characters in a book, puppets on a stage. We think we’re making our own choices, but in truth, everything is orchestrated by some supreme will. Maybe there are even countless watchers out there, peering at us from angles we can’t imagine - watching our lives like a play.”

“The freedom we think we have… might just be an illusion.”

Sun Lingtong was quiet for a moment. Then he shrugged. “I don’t know the answer to that.”

“But even if it’s true - so what?”

“We can’t rise above Heaven anyway, can we?”

“Can the so-called immortals defy Heaven? I have no idea.”

“But I do know this: for people like us, insignificant as we are, even if we are being controlled, all we’re doing is putting on one small show after another.”

“So what if it’s not real freedom?”

“Even a puppet on a stage can enjoy the performance, right? Either way, all of this is pretty damn interesting, isn’t it?”

Ning Zhuo fell silent.

Sun Lingtong added with a trace of comfort in his voice, “In the end, we’re still too weak. Digging into questions like this now - there’s no way we’ll find any answers.”

“Better to enjoy the adventure while it lasts. Keep cultivating, one step at a time. When we become someone important one day, then we can revisit these questions.”

Ning Zhuo thought for a moment, then said slowly, “Boss, I’ve been thinking… I really believe that buying Burden-Bearing Tactics was my own decision.”

“I skimmed through all the military techniques at the All-Book Pavilion. I compared their summaries over and over. In the end, this one fit best.”

“If fate were all-powerful, capable of arranging everything, how could someone like Forgetful River Prefecture Lord exist?”

Sun Lingtong clapped in approval. “Exactly! I knew your brain wasn’t just for show, Little Zhuo - you figured it out.”

“If fate could truly control everything, it would never allow a cultivator like that to rebel against Heaven. That’d just be asking for trouble!”

“I really like that answer.”

“That means none of this is fixed. It’s not all written in some divine script. That makes things a whole lot more interesting.”

As he spoke, Sun Lingtong couldn't help but recall the poem Ning Zhuo had recited in the Lava Immortal Palace:

“Five breaths nourish the soul, blood connects to life,

Three sects combined form the foundation.

Through sixteen winters and summers, my heart has endured bitter suffering,

After ten thousand trials, my will has grown stronger.

Emotions and reason entwined pull the strings,

The world bows to the ruler of ages.

Demonic roots sink deep - who needs salvation?

With unyielding perseverance, I aim for the summit of the heavens!”

Sun Lingtong sighed. “In truth, we’re the same kind of people as Forgetful River Prefecture Lord. The one who helped us, Ash Bone Elder, he’s the one who follows Heaven’s will.”

Ning Zhuo’s expression shifted slightly. “Speaking of Ash Bone Elder... if I ever get the chance, I’d really like to learn from him.”

“If it’s possible, I’d even want to take him as my master.”

Sun Lingtong said, “I’ve considered studying the art of divination too, but I worry that old man keeps things way too strict. Of all the countless branches of cultivation, divination is the one that delves deepest into the mysteries of fate.”

“I want to learn it too.”

But Ning Zhuo hit the heart of the matter with a single sentence: “Boss, you want to learn it so you can steal other people’s fate, don’t you?”

Sun Lingtong burst out laughing. “Haha, don’t you think that sounds fun? What if one day I really do pull it off, and the poor sucker doesn’t even realize their treasure’s been stolen?”

“Just imagining that makes me grin!”

Ning Zhuo said, “Divination isn’t exactly a mainstream art. I just hope Ash Bone Elder will be willing to teach me a few secrets, seeing as I’m a variable of the Yang Heaven through the threads of fate.”

Sun Lingtong shook his head. “I wouldn’t count on it. We’re not his kind of people. I’ve encountered one of his incarnations before - he gave me this feeling of seeing straight through everything, deep and unfathomable.”

“Rather than trying to take him as your master, I think your better shot might be joining the Myriad Manifestations Sect. They’ve probably got techniques on divination.”

Sun Lingtong had always had a sharp eye for people.

Back in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, he’d seen right through Zhu Xuanji’s true nature, latched on to him like a barnacle, shamelessly clingy - and it had actually worked. Zhu Xuanji couldn’t shake him off.

Naturally, Ning Zhuo trusted in his boss’s instincts. Hearing this, he quietly lowered his expectations for Ash Bone Elder.

“Even so, I still want to pay Ash Bone Elder a visit myself. If it works out, great. If not, no harm done.”

“As for the Myriad Manifestations Sect, being one of the major powers, they should have divination arts. Maybe I can get access there.”

“And even if both of those don’t work out, we’ll have to make a point of tracking down these arts wherever we can. Boss, what do you think?”

Sun Lingtong responded immediately, “I’m all in - both hands, both feet in favor!”

After everything they’d been through, both of them had come to truly appreciate just how formidable divination arts could be. The temptation was real.

In the Underworld, Sun Lingtong was leading his cavalry deeper into the heartlands of Forgetful River Prefecture.

His goal: to find Luo Si and seek further assistance.

In the world of the living, Ning Zhuo continued cultivating while also keeping tabs on Sun Lingtong’s movements and monitoring the situation in White Paper Immortal City.

He had paused his soul cultivation. His soul’s growth had surged too rapidly, overwhelming his physical body.

As a result, he had adjusted his training: most of his time was now spent hidden within the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, strengthening his physical foundation.

Aside from that, he focused on training Burden-Bearing Tactics. The techniques from the Three Sects had been mostly set aside for now due to time constraints.

Burden-Bearing Tactics allowed him to absorb external baleful energy, condense it into a unified force, and form what was known as military sha. This could then be applied in a variety of ways.

For example, infusing it into his spells made them far more lethal.

More importantly, military sha was especially effective against ghosts and petty evil spirits, making it incredibly useful for Ning Zhuo in combatting the supernatural.

He was gathering military sha to fulfill one of three key prerequisites needed to disrupt Forgetful River Prefecture Lord’s century-long plan.

Qing Chi, meanwhile, was collecting military sha to accelerate the formation of her army’s core spirit - her military will.

While Ning Zhuo cultivated inside the colossal paper statue, Qing Chi sat cross-legged by its feet.

The latter’s comprehension was remarkable as well - she quickly grasped the essence of the military technique and grew more adept with each use.

The rate at which her military will condensed rose steadily, with new signs of progress visible every single day.

Ning Zhuo quietly took note of Qing Chi’s advancement.

In the past, he had kept a respectful distance from her. After all, he wasn’t Jiao Ma and didn’t want to interfere with her future happiness.

But now, the situation had changed. It involved the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord’s century-old poisonous scheme, the safety of the entire White Paper Immortal City, and his mother’s final wish. Ning Zhuo had no choice but to adjust his approach.

So in between cultivation sessions, he began to take the initiative in inviting Qing Chi and Li Xiangshang to dine with him.

Qing Chi was delighted and always accepted without hesitation. She did her best to get him drunk at every meal, urging him to drink more - her intentions were far from pure.

Realizing this, Ning Zhuo started inviting her less frequently and spent more time with Li Xiangshang instead.

Spending time with Li Xiangshang also allowed Ning Zhuo to better gauge Qing Chi’s progress in forming her military will.

After several gatherings, Ning Zhuo had developed a much clearer understanding of Li Xiangshang.

He learned that Li Xiangshang was a devout cultivator. His true form was a carp, fished out of the river by Madam Mooncatcher.

Long ago, the White-Haired Dragon Sovereign had forbidden fishing in the Cang River. Madam Mooncatcher had cast her net in open defiance, so the Dragon Sovereign appeared to stop her. The two ended up making a wager.

The terms of the bet were as follows: the Dragon Sovereign would pick one carp from her net, cultivate it, and place it into a pond of Weakwater, betting that the creature could successfully cultivate, rise layer by layer through the treacherous waters, and eventually escape the Weakwater’s grasp.

Clearly, Li Xiangshang was that fortunate fish.

Originally lost and dazed, he would never have found the cultivation path on his own.

But after being chosen, the Dragon Sovereign personally passed on to him the treasured scripture Ascending Dragon Transformation, and supplied him with top-grade cultivation resources - everything riding on that single bet.

In the end, Li Xiangshang did not disappoint. He dedicated himself wholly to cultivation, ascended through layer after layer of Weakwater, gradually drawing closer to the surface. Finally, he broke through and leapt out, transcending the limits of his existence.

Grateful and full of reverence for the White-Haired Dragon Sovereign, Li Xiangshang became one of his followers after helping him win the wager.

Even now, he remained primarily focused on cultivation, rarely interacting with others.

This time, he had been in seclusion when the Dragon Sovereign summoned him, ordering him to bring the Golden Nest Demon Seed to White Paper Immortal City and carry out a support mission.

Having uncovered these details, Ning Zhuo was inwardly amazed. With his usual finesse, he quickly built rapport with Li Xiangshang.

At first, Li Xiangshang had held a negative impression of him. But Ning Zhuo’s gentle and gracious demeanor, like a spring breeze, soon changed his view.

At one banquet, when Qing Chi wasn’t present, Ning Zhuo pretended to be slightly drunk and proactively suggested a friendly sparring match with Li Xiangshang.

That spar earned him Li Xiangshang’s respect on the spot.

Ning Zhuo raised his cup. “Senior Li, there’s something I’ve been dying to ask. But I’ve held back out of concern - it might seem like I’m prying into the secrets of your cultivation, and I’d never want to offend you.”

Li Xiangshang clinked glasses with him, downed the drink, and laughed. “You’re wondering about my innate talent, aren’t you? If you asked Qing Chi, she’d tell you. Not only does she know the name of my talent, she’s even benefited from it herself.”

Ning Zhuo shook his head. “That would be disrespectful to you, Senior. If I go around asking others about your cultivation, that’s not how one treats a friend.”

“I’d rather ask you directly. If you’d prefer not to say, I’ll understand completely. I’ll down three cups in apology and never bring it up again.”

Hearing that, Li Xiangshang’s opinion of Ning Zhuo rose yet again.

He scratched the back of his head. “Ah, it’s really not much of a secret - plenty of people know already.”

“My innate talent is a lower-tier one. It’s called Filling Out the Numbers - basically a ‘scrap fish’ just used to make up the numbers. As the name implies, it lowers the threshold for many aspects of cultivation.”

“For example, condensing military will is tough. But with my assistance, Miss Qing Chi was able to step past the initial barrier.”

Ning Zhuo’s eyes lit up at the words, his fingers tightening unconsciously around his wine cup.

He leaned forward. “How much can it lower cultivation standards? Are there any limits?”

Li Xiangshang replied that he had studied the effects for a long time. Most cultivation thresholds could indeed be reduced. However, the extent of the reduction was limited - and came at a steep cost.

With a bitter smile, Li Xiangshang said, “The downside is pretty severe. Otherwise, this ‘Filling Out the Numbers’ wouldn’t still be ranked as a lower-tier talent.”

Ning Zhuo gave an “oh” of realization and hazarded a guess. “Senior Li, let me take a stab at it. Does using this gift cause festering wounds?”

Li Xiangshang shook his head. “It’s much worse than that.”

He lifted the armor at his midsection and pressed a finger against one of his fish scales.

Ning Zhuo saw the scale cave in deeply under the touch - there was no resistance, no rebound. It sank inward, leaving a hollow pit behind.

He immediately understood.

Li Xiangshang spoke plainly. “More than half the flesh on my body has already rotted away. If I weren’t constantly maintaining myself, healing day after day, I’d have been dead long ago.”

“My current combat strength is less than a tenth of what it once was.”

“Each time I activate my talent, I need a long period of recovery. Lord Dragon has sought out countless spirit medicines for me, and even treated me personally. But none of it helped much.”

“That’s what a lower-tier talent means. But I have no complaints.”

“If not for this talent, the Dragon Sovereign would never have chosen me. Without the ability to lower cultivation standards, how could I have ever completed the Ascending Dragon Transformation?”

“Compared to the countless ordinary carp in the river, I’ve been incredibly lucky.”

Ning Zhuo gave a heartfelt sigh. “Your composure is as calm and vast as the sea, Senior. It’s something this junior should learn from.”

He then narrowed his eyes slightly and pressed his thumb against the mechanism ring, speaking with quiet meaning. “A talent is still a talent. Even if it’s classified as lower-tier, when used in the right way, it can produce astonishing, unimaginable power and utility.”

Just like Zheng Jian’s Heart-Piercing Insight.

That was a mid-tier talent, granting cultivators extraordinary intuition. Its biggest flaw was that it only activated when the mind was completely calm.

But Zheng Jian’s spiritual essence was sealed inside a mechanism ring - devoid of thought, always tranquil. In his case, that major flaw had been completely nullified.

Looking at Li Xiangshang now, Ning Zhuo found himself wanting to ask aloud: Has Senior Li ever considered cultivating in a new body? Flesh is frail... Ascend through mechanisms instead.
