Chapter 444: Lord Long vs. the White Jade Battalion

The entire White Jade Battalion was filled with wails.

Lord Long displayed an absolutely powerful attacking posture; as soon as he made his move, he directly broke through the battle formation's Dharma Aspect.

Because this was a moving formation, every cultivator was a component of it. Therefore, when the Dharma Aspect was broken, all the members participating in the formation suffered backlash.

Lord Long stood tall like a mountain, proudly gazing around in all directions, then lowered his head and rubbed his fingers, calmly commenting, "Insufficient training; the Dharma Aspect is mere form without substance."

"Is there anything else? Bring it all out for me to see."

This arrogant posture did not suppress the morale of the cultivators of the White Jade Battalion; instead, it enraged them.

"Hey! This old geezer is quite arrogant."

"Brothers, let's get him together!"

"A mere Nascent Soul level, daring to step into our military formation —courting death!!"

Without waiting for Commander Shuang Jing's orders, his deputy commanders swarmed out and launched a siege on Lord Long.

There were seven deputy commanders in total, all at the Golden Core level.

Shuang Jing was positioned somewhat at the rear, riding his mount, shouting loudly, "Change formation! Change formation!!"

Holding the General's Seal in his hand, he used divine sense to transmit the upcoming formation changes to the entire army rapidly.

But most of the soldiers of the White Jade Battalion had not yet recovered; many were screaming, moaning in unbearable pain, and some even fainted on the spot.

Seeing this, Shuang Jing immediately took out a stack of command tokens from his bosom.

These tokens were instruments of military tactics—red plaques with golden characters, imposing and majestic. The military command tokens had a triangular shape at the top, tapering down like a stout treasured sword.

Shuang Jing threw these tokens out one after another, continuously shouting, "Military situation urgent as fire, quickly form the formation!"

"Military situation urgent as fire, quickly form the formation!"

"Military situation urgent as fire, quickly form the formation!"

In the next moment, the soldiers who had just been unable to get up were lifted by an invisible force, forcibly dragged to their positions in the battle formation.

Some could barely walk; others were directly dragged along.

Some were even more unlucky, shouting, "Don't drag me, don't drag me! Ah, I'm about to do the splits!"

By forcibly forming the formation like this, Shuang Jing quickly built a second battle formation —the Seven Stars Gathering Power Formation.

As this formation slowly activated, starlight immediately shone brilliantly, like thousands of fireflies dancing. These starlights gathered above the heads of the seven Golden Core deputy commanders, like seven beams of light pouring into their bodies.

The deputy commanders howled, their bodies directly growing two or three inches taller, their aura surging, spiritual power gushing wildly, and their combat power instantly soaring several times!

"This is the feeling —I am ridiculously strong!!" one Golden Core deputy commander howled, charging toward Lord Long first.

Lord Long sidestepped, avoiding his attack, then pushed out with a giant palm, hitting the ribs of the Golden Core deputy commander.

The Golden Core deputy commander was like a ball, knocked flying far away before landing on the ground.

Aooo!

The sound of a dragon's roar rose again.

He almost crashed into his comrades; fortunately, Shuang Jing timely used his commander's power to directly move the cultivators in that area away.

The Golden Core deputy commander spat out a mouthful of blood, sat down cross-legged immediately, and began emergency healing.

Because after his ribs were broken, they directly pierced his lungs. Such an injury forced him to temporarily withdraw from the battle.

Lord Long's Dragon Roar Palm kept striking, and with each swing of his palm, there was the sound of a dragon's roar.

"Roar, roar, roar..."

The dragon roars rose one after another; the Golden Core deputy commanders were successively knocked flying, landing on the ground like sandbags.

But soon, they all stood up again, spat out a mouthful of blood or spat out the teeth that had been knocked loose, and charged again.

The battle armor and other equipment on them, although standard and the same as everyone else's, were still very exquisite and of high quality.

Even though the cultivation methods they practiced were different, the same equipment could better bring out the power of the battle formation. Don't forget, there was also the support of national power and military strength, allowing them to directly confront terrifying Nascent Soul-level combat power like Lord Long's, and even have one or two exchanges.

Lord Long was experienced; in his long life, it was not the first time he had charged into a battle formation.

But this time, he clearly felt that the White Jade Battalion's formation had great stamina and toughness. The seven Golden Core deputy commanders, although not his match even for one move, would get knocked away but come back again, like balls bouncing off a wall, making him extremely annoyed.

Anger surged in Lord Long's heart; he suddenly changed his offensive.

Divine Bestowed Technique —Withered Wood Meets Spring!

Martial Art —Withered Dragon Claw!

Divine technique and martial art overlapped; Lord Long changed from palm to claw, suddenly grabbing a certain Golden Core deputy commander.

His five fingertips were extremely sharp, directly piercing the arm of the Golden Core deputy commander, embedding deep into the muscle, reaching the bone.

The Golden Core deputy commander groaned, attacking frantically.

"Let him go!!!"

The other deputy commanders hurriedly surrounded, launching fierce attacks from all directions.

Lord Long stood firm without dodging, chest held high.

Divine Bestowed Technique ——Divine Dragon Treasure Body!

In an instant, his whole body glowed, forming a semi-transparent dragon scale armor that covered his entire body.

The attacks of the Golden Core deputy commanders landed on the dragon scale armor, only causing the scales to ripple, emitting crisp clanging sounds, unable to harm Lord Long's inner body.

On the other hand, the Golden Core deputy commander whose arm was grabbed screamed miserably.

His voice was extremely shrill; his whole person seemed to shrink, rapidly transforming from a robust man into an emaciated invalid—cheekbones protruding, eye sockets deep-set, life aura turning from prosperity to decline, and his full head of black hair turning snow white in a few breaths.

Lord Long sneered; the arm in his hand was instantly drained into a dried corpse, which he casually discarded.

"His life force was absorbed!"

"What a vicious method."

"What should we do?"

"I'll handle it!!"

A Golden Core deputy commander made a prompt decision, wielded his treasured blade, and slashed fiercely.

The blade light was extremely sharp, directly severing the screaming Golden Core deputy commander's arm.

The Golden Core deputy commander regained himself and retreated frantically.

The other deputy commanders cooperated tacitly, surrounding and attacking to cover his retreat.

"Why the hurry?"

"All your life forces are my nourishment!"

The Golden Core deputy commanders fell into a bitter battle.

They were only at the Golden Core level. Normally, with the support of the battle formation, they could completely confront and entangle a Nascent Soul-level enemy.

But Lord Long himself was at the peak of Nascent Soul cultivation, and with the terrifying blessing of Dragon King's divine power, his overall combat power was about to surpass the Nascent Soul level, almost reaching quasi-Soul Formation —nothing less!

"This old man is really formidable; only if I personally take action can we deal with him," Shuang Jing keenly observed the battlefield.

He was a disciple of a high sect and not cowardly.

At this moment, facing a strong enemy, there was fear in his heart, but even more was passionate fighting spirit —if he could take down Lord Long, how much military merit would that be!

"With this military merit, returning to the royal capital, I will surely be ennobled."

"If this battle succeeds, even if I then retreat to the second line under the pretext of serious injuries, no one can criticize me."

The more Shuang Jing thought, the more excited he became, and he took out a medicine bottle from his bosom.

He opened the bottle cap and swallowed a Nascent Soul-level pill.

Whoosh.

His aura surged by thirty percent.

He then opened another medicine bottle and raised his head, pouring all the medicinal powder inside into his mouth.

Whoosh!

His aura surged another thirty percent.
