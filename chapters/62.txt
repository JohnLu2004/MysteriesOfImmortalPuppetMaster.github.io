Chapter 62: You Invented This Mechanical Monkey?

The next moment, Fei Si pushed the door open and entered.

Zhu Xuanji stared at Fei Si with deep eyes. “You came quite quickly.”

Fei Si smiled, though there was bitterness in that smile.

Given Zhu Xuanji’s special identity, Fei Si made sure to watch his every move. Although no explicit orders had come from the City Lord, Fei Si still knew what he had to do.

Thus, when Zhu Xuanji and the others returned from the volcano and headed straight for the Flying Disk Workshop, Fei Si received the news immediately.

The Flying Disk Workshop and Chen Cha were both closely connected to Fei Si. Now that the Fire Persimmon Festival was nearing, he urgently needed as many explosive fire monkeys as possible.

The upcoming Fire Persimmon Festival was Fei Si’s responsibility. He didn’t dare to be careless.

Once he heard that Zhu Xuanji was heading to the Flying Disk Workshop, he could no longer sit still and immediately rushed over.

“First of all, I have nothing to do with the emergence of the immortal palace,” Fei Si began. “Second, this all started from a small mistake on my part.”

He proceeded to explain that he had been worried about the livelihood of the citizens and concerned that the Southern Bean royal dynasty’s property would be damaged, and thus hastily presented the explosive fire monkey to the City Lord, believing in error that Chen Cha was the creator.

When he realized his mistake, Chen Cha suggested covering things up.

Fei Si was hesitant at first, but Chen Cha persuaded him persistently, and he eventually assented.

Chen Cha then privately approached Ning Zhuo, requesting that Ning Zhuo transfer the identity of inventor to him in exchange for a heavy reward.

Ning Zhuo agreed.

The two then signed a contract to jointly keep the secret. (In truth, this was Fei Si's direct order to Chen Cha, with the contract added afterward.)

“Nice story,” Chi Dun sneered, staring at Fei Si. “But I know you’re lying.”

Zhu Xuanji’s frowned deepened. With his technique, he could tell that much of what Fei Si said was false, but the general outline was still true.

Considering that Fei Si was a Golden Core cultivator with high status and in charge of the day-to-day affairs of Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Zhu Xuanji chose not to expose him outright.

Zheng Shuanggou turned to Ning Zhuo, looking at him with new eyes. “So you’re the real inventor of the mechanical monkey.”

Ning Zhuo hurriedly bowed again and expressed his gratitude for Zheng Shuanggou's favor of saving his life.

Zheng Shuanggou had once saved the remnants of a Ning Clan expedition team at the peak of the volcano. Ning Zhuo, Ning Yong, and Ning Chen had all been among those present.

Zheng Shuanggou smiled. “Since you remember my favor, how will you repay me?” He was clearly interested in recruiting Ning Zhuo, having seen his talent in mechanical arts.

Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly. “As a cultivator of the Ning Clan, I may not be able to fully repay you, sir, but I will do my best.”

Zheng Shuanggou waved his hand. “Forget it, I won’t make things difficult for a junior like you.”

Ning Zhuo was surnamed Ning. Forcibly recruiting him might cause trouble with the Ning Clan.

The three clans were already discussing an alliance to oppose the City Lord Mansion. Since Ning Zhuo was recultivating, whether or not he joined Zheng Clan no longer really mattered.

Zhu Xuanji turned to Ning Zhuo again. “You were at the scene when the immortal palace appeared?”

Ning Zhuo: “Yes. I was lucky enough to survive.”

“Haha. I know about that,” Chi Dun laughed. Having heard some dirt on Fei Si, he was clearly in a good mood. “After the incident, I went and interrogated many people. The cultivators of Ning Clan were among the first.

“At that time, aside from the normal heart-questioning formation, I also had the Warning Heart Bell that Sir City Lord personally bestowed upon me.

“It was precisely thanks to the Warning Heart Bell going off that I was able to detect the hidden black shadow demonic cultivator. Afterward, I gave chase, and the demonic cultivator escaped into Fire Persimmon Forest.”

Zhu Xuanji nodded and asked the key question: “When did you start creating the explosive fire monkey? Was your blueprint ever leaked? Did anyone else know about it?”

Moments later, Zhu Xuanji learned that some explosive fire monkeys had been sold even before the immortal palace emerged.

On the very day Ning Zhuo consulted Chen Cha and formed a partnership, they had immediately begun producing and selling explosive fire monkeys.

According to Chen Cha, it was because he needed to test the market response to appropriately decide on investment and production scale.

Ning Zhuo claimed that his blueprint hadn’t leaked, but he was merely a Qi Refining cultivator. He might not even be able to tell if someone was spying on him.

In short, this lead was a dead end.

Tracking down every single buyer of an explosive fire monkey was something that made Zhu Xuanji’s scalp go numb just from imagining it.

And that would only account for the direct purchases.

In reality, a single mechanical monkey could easily pass through multiple hands after being resold several times…

At this point, Zhu Xuanji had completely lost interest in the Flying Disk Workshop, Chen Cha, and Ning Zhuo.

As he was leaving, Fei Si saw him off. “Sir Zhu, there’s really no need to go to such trouble in this investigation.

“The Fire Persimmon Festival is nearly here. At that time, we’ll encircle and suppress the black shadow demonic cultivator.

“As long as we capture them alive and interrogate them with the Divine Investigation Bureau’s methods, the mastermind will surely be revealed.”

These were Fei Si’s true thoughts.

As the one handling most city affairs, every single second of his day was calculated with an extreme focus on efficiency.

To him, Zhu Xuanji’s extensive investigation seemed like a terribly inefficient waste of effort.

The culprit was hiding in the Fire Persimmon Forest. Once they captured the real culprit, wouldn’t that solve everything in one go?

Zhu Xuanji let out a cold snort and looked at Fei Si. “I understand what you mean. Don’t worry. On the day of the Fire Persimmon Festival, I will be there in person.

“I really want to meet that black shadow demonic cultivator face to face!”

Fei Si smiled. These words were exactly what he had hoped to hear, an assurance of reinforcements.

Zhu Xuanji, as a member of the Divine Investigation Bureau, possessed formidable combat power. Moreover, he was someone from the royal family, so he surely carried some powerful treasures.

With him joining in, the odds of capturing the black shadow demonic cultivator would rise significantly.

Zhu Xuanji left the Flying Disk Workshop.

Soon after, Zheng Shuanggou bid farewell to Zhu Xuanji and took his leave.

Only Chi Dun remained. His thoughts were actually similar to Fei Si’s; he wanted to catch the black shadow demonic cultivator during the Fire Persimmon Festival and solve the core problem directly.

Zhu Xuanji sneered. “Do you really think the black shadow demonic cultivator is the true culprit of the immortal palace bombing?”

Chi Dun was stunned. “You mean he isn’t?”

Zhu Xuanji shook his head. “Don’t be blinded by assumptions.

“Take a look at the current clues. The immortal palace emerged after suffering damage from a bombardment.

“The bombardment was carried out by a mechanical monkey. That’s a mechanical construct that could be controlled by anyone.”

Chi Dun stopped in place. Zhu Xuanji’s words made a lot of sense.

“But if it’s not the black shadow demonic cultivator, who else could it be?” He racked his brain, then suddenly trembled, showing an expression of disbelief. “Could it be... Zheng Shuanggou?!”

Zhu Xuanji shook his head again. “Anything is possible.

“Just think – what if the black shadow demonic cultivator isn’t the true culprit? If we mistakenly go along with that assumption and waste valuable time investigating in the wrong direction, how will we answer to our superiors?”

Chi Dun nodded. “Sir Zhu’s words are correct. But hasn’t the lead on the mechanical monkey gone cold?”

Zhu Xuanji smiled faintly and looked up at the sky. “Chi Dun, you’ve forgotten that there’s actually an even more critical lead.

“The direct cause of the explosion that damaged the immortal palace wasn’t the mechanical monkey, but that thousand jin of fire essence.

“Buying that much fire essence in one go would surely leave an impression on the seller!”

Chi Dun clapped his hands in excitement. “Yes, yes! Now that is a solid lead.”

Zhu Xuanji turned to him. “So next, I want you to lead me around the immortal city’s markets for investigation.”

“Understood, Sir!” Seeing hope for the investigation, Chi Dun replied with renewed enthusiasm.
