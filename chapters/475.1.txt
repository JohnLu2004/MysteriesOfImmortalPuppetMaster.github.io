Author Note: Relying Only on Myself!

Not long ago, I participated in the Shanghai Online Literature International Exchange Cultural Week, exploring overseas online literature review standards and more.

Next, I’ll be attending a seven-day training program at the Lu Xun Literary Institute.

As a result, updates might become irregular or even pause entirely. I’ll do my best to notify everyone in advance and ask for leave if needed.

Whether it’s the previous Shanghai awards ceremony, the cultural week’s international forums, or the upcoming Lu Xun Literary Institute training, I’ve been working hard, seeking a way forward.

Staying trapped in the mountains won’t save the trees.

Once out of the mountains, the road ahead stretches far and long, and I can only rely on myself to explore it.

Counting on others is unreliable. I can only depend on myself!

I’m holding onto this determination.

Sometimes, I wake up in the middle of the night, unable to fall back asleep, pacing the room. In the dead silence of the night, I can hear the sound of flames burning. I know—it’s the fire in my heart.

The fire scorches me, filled with my cries—to grow stronger, to become even stronger!

Only by strengthening myself can I hope to change anything.

During the Shanghai event, I was writing until 2 a.m. nearly every night.

This trip to the Lu Xun Literary Institute will be even tighter on time, but I’ll do my best not to stop updating.

Alliance leader gifts will have to be delayed.

I’ll make up for the missed updates.

There will be a second, third, and even more livestreams.

The updates may not be fast, and my clumsy typing will be a challenge I’ll address in the future.

Carrying the burden, I press forward!

Forward!
