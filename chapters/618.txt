Chapter 618: Tough Negotiations

Qing Yan's eyes nearly popped out of their sockets.

Despite Jiao Ma's reputation for being "hot-headed", Qing Yan never expected him to resort to violence so readily. This wasn't just youthful impulsiveness - it was sheer recklessness!

Yang Sanyan froze in shock for a moment, then his face darkened like a stormy sea. He was about to retaliate when Ning Zhuo's follow-up attack arrived.

Fire Element - Nine Heavens Fire Dragon Technique!

Blazing flames erupted instantly, engulfing Ning Zhuo's surroundings.

Roar!

Three fire dragons materialized from the sea of flames, their roars shaking the air as they lunged at Yang Sanyan.

The air distorted from the intense heat, turning Qing Yan, Qing Chi, and the others crimson-faced.

Yang Sanyan enveloped himself in a layer of azure light, completely shielding himself from the scorching heat.

His face twisted with fury, his eyes glinting with murderous intent.

"How dare a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator attack without warning? This brat clearly had no respect for me!"

Yang Sanyan prepared to teach Jiao Ma, this arrogant upstart, a proper lesson.

But in the next instant, the fire dragons' power surged again, and they devoured Yang Sanyan whole.

Fire Element Heart Temple!

Ning Zhuo had deliberately held back this trump card, waiting for the perfect moment to catch Yang Sanyan off guard.

In the next instant, Yang Sanyan snorted coldly, braced his arms, and unleashed a surge of azure light that coalesced into a spherical barrier, shattering the fire dragon.

Ning Zhuo formed a sword-like gesture with his fingers, held them upright before his chest, and exhaled a bolt of golden lightning.

Metal Element - Mythic Gold Slash!

Metal Element Lung Temple!

Qing-Jiao Army's Military Power Amplification!

A blinding golden flash streaked past, its razor-sharp edge slicing through the azure barrier. It grazed Yang Sanyan's side before piercing the wall, leaving a gaping hole that vanished into the vast expanse above the Immortal City.

As a deputy commander, Ning Zhuo could naturally harness the army's power.

For a moment, Yang Sanyan stood motionless, his expression shifting dramatically. He stared at Ning Zhuo with newfound respect, his earlier arrogance and anger completely gone, replaced by caution and admiration.

Ning Zhuo also withdrew his attack, focusing on controlling the remaining two fire dragons. One coiled around him protectively, while the other snatched up the stunned Qing Chi and flew her back to Qing Yan's side.

Yang Sanyan watched Qing Chi's rescue without making any move to intervene.

The Mythic Gold Slash, amplified by the army's power, had reached the Nascent Soul level of strength. Even Yang Sanyan's prized defensive techniques had failed to withstand it.

Yang Sanyan, a Golden Core cultivator, could unleash Nascent Soul-level combat power, making him renowned for his martial prowess within the Myriad Manifestations Sect. Yet the yellow-faced youth before him, merely at the Foundation Establishment stage, had just unleashed an attack of Nascent Soul caliber.

"He wields the Nine Heavens Fire Dragon Technique with remarkable skill. This notoriously wild and uncontrollable spell has been refined into a versatile tool, capable of both destructive force and life-saving precision. What mastery of his techniques!"

Even more striking to Yang Sanyan was Ning Zhuo's combat aptitude.

"He possesses methods to amplify spells, yet when casting the Fire Dragon Technique, he deliberately held back, calculating that I wouldn't intercept it prematurely. Only when the attack was imminent did he suddenly amplify its power."

"But that was merely a feint. When he unleashed the Mythic Gold Slash, he repeated the trick, simultaneously employing two amplification methods to catch me completely off guard."

"Most notably, the second amplification involved military power. This means he's already a member of the Qing-Jiao Army."

Thoughts raced through Yang Sanyan's mind like lightning.

Qing Chi stared at Ning Zhuo in astonishment. "Little Ma, how did you suddenly become so strong?"

Qing Yan, meanwhile, watched Yang Sanyan with tense vigilance, fearing the man might lash out at any moment.

He was deeply worried. "Jiao Ma's methods are ruthless, but Yang Sanyan is no pushover. If this escalates, what will we do?"

As if in response to Qing Yan's anxiety, Ning Zhuo suddenly smiled, clasped his hands in a respectful salute, and said, "Junior Jiao Ma pays his respects to Senior Yang Sanyan of the Myriad Manifestations Sect."

"Senior, I have some matters I need to discuss with you privately. May I?"

Yang Sanyan's tense expression softened into a smile. "Not bad. No wonder my brother willingly pledged his allegiance to you."

"Very well. Let's move to a more private location and talk."

Though arrogant, Yang Sanyan admired capable cultivators.

Throughout his time in White Paper Immortal City, Ning Zhuo had never stopped gathering intelligence. Yang Weida had mentioned Yang Sanyan repeatedly, so Ning Zhuo had long since collected information about the man's personality.

Having heard Qing Yan's account of Yang Sanyan's pride, Ning Zhuo acted decisively when the situation turned unfavorable.

The Mythic Gold Slash could have struck Yang Sanyan directly, but Ning Zhuo deliberately aimed wide, intending only to demonstrate his strength.

Yang Sanyan quickly recognized the reality of the situation and immediately changed his attitude.

In terms of combat prowess alone, Ning Zhuo posed a significant threat to Yang Sanyan. More crucially, Ning Zhuo was still young and only at the Foundation Establishment stage, a testament to his extraordinary cultivation talent.

Yang Sanyan and Ning Zhuo departed the chaotic scene.

Soon, they began a private conversation.

Ning Zhuo took out a storage pouch. "I got along well with your younger brother. Brother Yang personally gifted me this when he first came to join me."

"Now that Brother Yang has tragically passed away, I feel unworthy to accept his possessions. Senior Yang, as his elder brother, I return this storage pouch to you."

Ning Zhuo's first gesture moved Yang Sanyan deeply.

He instinctively accepted the pouch, his fingers trembling slightly.

Opening the pouch, he infused it with his divine sense and swiftly scanned its contents. "This matches exactly what my brother described in his letter", he thought.

It made sense. Yang Weida had met his end on the very first day after defecting to Ning Zhuo.

Upon hearing this tragic news, Ning Zhuo had decisively halted any use of Yang Weida's resources, all for this moment.

Unbeknownst to Ning Zhuo, Yang Weida had written to Yang Sanyan before defecting, outlining his plan in detail.

Yang Sanyan tightened the pouch's drawstring and tucked it into his robe.

He sighed deeply, his cold expression softening considerably. "Given my nature, I wouldn't normally accept this storage pouch. But since it's a memento of my late brother, keeping it with me will serve as a reminder."

"You young man act with admirable straightforwardness," Yang Sanyan remarked.

Ning Zhuo smiled faintly. "By offering this storage pouch, I'm not only demonstrating my sincerity but also expressing my goodwill toward Senior Yang. I hope you'll provide further support to help me establish the Qing-Jiao Army."

Yang Sanyan was once again taken aback by Ning Zhuo's words.

He couldn't help but scrutinize the Yellow-Faced Youth before him. "It seems White Paper Immortal City has finally produced some local talent."

Ning Zhuo's request might seem unreasonable at first glance, but it perfectly aligned with Yang Sanyan's own plans.

Yang Sanyan's arrival in White Paper Immortal City wasn't solely due to Yang Weida's presence; he also carried a mission from his sect.

One of his objectives was to stabilize the situation and secure greater influence for the sect.

The death of his younger brother, Yang Weida, had plunged Yang Sanyan into profound grief.

Yet his swift capture of Qing Chi and summoning of Ning Zhuo weren't merely acts of vengeance for his brother's death. They served a deeper purpose: the Qing-Jiao Army.

Qing Chi was the commander of the Qing-Jiao Army, and Ning Zhuo's earlier use of the army's power indicated that he was also one of its leaders.

Yang Sanyan keenly realized that once the Qing-Jiao Army was truly established, it would inevitably become a pivotal force within the White Paper Immortal City.

Combined with a Golden Core-level commander, this force would possess combat power equivalent to a Nascent Soul cultivator, rivaling even the White Paper City Lord.

With careful planning, the Myriad Manifestations Sect could nurture the Qing-Jiao Army into one of the city's major factions. This would significantly benefit the sect's future efforts to gather cultivation resources in the Ghostly Black Marshlands.

Though arrogant by nature, Yang Sanyan was far from foolish, possessing considerable strategic acumen and resourcefulness.

However, his plan to manipulate Jiao Ma to influence the Qing-Jiao Army took an unexpected turn.

Ning Zhuo's demonstrated combat prowess far exceeded his expectations.

Just as Yang Sanyan was regaining his composure and preparing to secretly negotiate with Jiao Ma, offering terms to support the Qing-Jiao Army, Ning Zhuo anticipated his intentions and openly requested substantial financial backing for the army.

Yang Sanyan's eyes gleamed. "Jiao Ma, you're a clever man. Speaking with clever people is always easy."

Before he could propose specific terms, Ning Zhuo spoke again, delivering a third shock: "I am not Jiao Ma. I assumed his identity. My real name is Ning Zhuo."

Yang Sanyan frowned. "What?"

Ning Zhuo: "I am the Vice City Lord of White Paper Immortal City, recognized by the current City Lord as its savior."

Yang Sanyan frowned even deeper. "Savior? What do you mean by that?"

Ning Zhuo didn't answer, continuing, "I'm not from here. I came from the Southern Bean Kingdom. My mother was Meng Yaoyin."

Yang Sanyan: "Meng Yaoyin?"

The name sounded vaguely familiar at first, but then he remembered, and his expression changed dramatically.

He stood up abruptly and walked over to Ning Zhuo. "Are you the son of Meng Yaoyin, our sect's Golden Core True Inheritor?"

Ning Zhuo nodded. "My mother passed away when I was two years old. While traveling the world, I've been collecting her relics and clues to understand what kind of person she truly was."

"That's how I arrived at White Paper Immortal City, only to find it besieged by a Ghost Tide and an Underworld Army."

"Senior Wen Ruanyu is unaware of this crisis, but the White Paper City Lord knows everything."

"Perhaps because of my mother's contributions to the Immortal City, the City Lord secretly appointed me as Vice City Lord."

"To protect me, she also gifted me three paper talismans, which I've placed in my three dantian."

Yang Sanyan stared blankly, overwhelmed by the rapid succession of revelations.

Ning Zhuo's barrage of information was too much to process at once.

Yang Sanyan blinked. "How can you prove..."

Before Ning Zhuo could finish speaking, he produced some of Meng Yaoyin's belongings. "I am deeply honored by Senior Wen Ruanyu's recommendation. Once this matter is resolved, I will take his letter to the Myriad Manifestations Sect and participate in the Soaring Cloud Assembly, hoping to join the Sect."

"By then, I believe I will have more reliable means to prove my identity."

Yang Sanyan took the items and examined them. "These aren't conclusive evidence."

Ning Zhuo nodded. "It's strange. My mother left no explicit instructions for me to return to the Myriad Manifestations Sect. I was fortunate to gather some crucial clues that led me back here."

Ning Zhuo's words carried an air of truthfulness.

Seeing Yang Sanyan's thoughtful expression, Ning Zhuo smiled slightly. "Actually, the definitive proof lies within this manual on mechanisms."

"The manual my mother left behind contains extensive notes on her cultivation insights and achievements."

"One section on Formation disguises explains how I discovered the hidden Formation space within the paper giant!"

Yang Sanyan nodded. "Senior Wen Ruanyu already reported this to the Sect. I was informed before my arrival."

"I didn't expect the situation to be like this..."

Ning Zhuo continued, "Because there's an Internal Traitor in the city who hasn't been uncovered, I didn't trust anyone. That's why I insisted on refining the Interwoven Field Paths Lantern within the Formation space."

"The Interwoven Field Paths Lantern will undoubtedly be handed over to the Sect," Yang Sanyan said. "You can hold onto it for now; that's not the main issue."

Yang Sanyan's lack of concern for the Interwoven Field Paths Lantern was excellent news for Ning Zhuo.

He was more interested in another matter. "Ning Zhuo, since you're wary of Wen Ruanyu, do you suspect he might be the Internal Traitor in the city?"

Ning Zhuo shook his head. "Based on what I've seen so far, he isn't."

"I've already identified someone else, and I'm eighty percent certain he's the Internal Traitor - or at least one of them!"

Yang Sanyan's expression turned sharp. "Tell me, who is it!" he demanded urgently.

Ning Zhuo smiled again, took a leisurely sip of his tea, and remained silent.

Yang Sanyan nearly slapped him. How dare a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator act so pretentious in front of me?

But then he remembered Ning Zhuo's strength and the content of their conversation. A chill ran down his spine.

He suddenly realized that since their secret meeting began, Ning Zhuo had been firmly in control of the conversation's pace. Despite being a Golden Core cultivator and a True Inheritance Disciple from a major sect, Yang Sanyan had been thoroughly outmaneuvered, led around by the nose.

Yang Sanyan took a deep breath, understanding Ning Zhuo's unspoken demand. With a cold snort, he declared, "I will fully fund the Qing-Jiao Army."

"To be honest, I've brought a substantial amount of resources - more than enough for your military logistics."

"These resources aren't mine personally; they're mission funds from the Myriad Manifestations Sect."

Ning Zhuo set down his teacup. "As expected of my mother's sect - the Myriad Manifestations Sect is truly generous!"

He fixed Yang Sanyan with a gaze, his tone hardening. "The Qing-Jiao Army is my army, and mine alone."

The unspoken implication was clear: the Myriad Manifestations Sect could provide funds, but they shouldn't presume to meddle with the Qing-Jiao Army.

Yang Sanyan narrowed his eyes. "Qing Chi still doesn't know your true identity. Are you planning to control this New Army by relying on your Jiao Ma disguise?"

Ning Zhuo shook his head, taking another sip of tea. "I'm fully confident in my approach. Senior Yang, you needn't concern yourself with that."

"If we reach this agreement, I'll reveal the identity of the Internal Traitor!"

Yang Sanyan's eyes narrowed further as he pondered. The fire of vengeance ultimately outweighed his reservations. "Very well. I'll agree to your terms this time. What then?"

Ning Zhuo clapped his hands in approval. "Excellent!"

Both Yang Sanyan and Ning Zhuo signed a written contract.

Yang Sanyan immediately handed Ning Zhuo three storage bracelets brimming with cultivation resources.

"Tell me who the Internal Traitor is now!" Yang Sanyan demanded impatiently as Ning Zhuo stowed away the bracelets.
