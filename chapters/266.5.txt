Chapter 266.5: Author's Note: This can be considered my final act of defiance.

The judge’s scene of seeking justice is extremely, extremely, extremely important!

The entire first major volume serves to portray Ning Zhuo.

If the events involving Sun Lingtong and Cheng Bai are to reveal Ning Zhuo's complete character, then this scene uncovers the core essence of Ning Zhuo.

To perfect this scene, I’ve been working tirelessly for three consecutive days, staying up until 5 a.m. each day.

Today, I even pulled an all-nighter.

I’m personally quite satisfied with it.

This scene is likely the peak of my recent years' literary work.

The overall plot has two intertwining lines: one revolves around the stage of the children's orphanage while the other is centered on the Historical Pavilion of the Lava Immortal Palace.

These two lines intersect and unfold simultaneously.

On one hand, the performance of "Seeking Justice" on stage, directed by Ning, intertwines with the events involving Ning Zhuo, Zhu Xuanji, Ning Xiaohui, and others.

Both space and plotlines are interwoven.

Through the play within the play, we depict Ning Zhuo’s hesitation, his wavering, and ultimately, his self-redemption.

His final psychological transformation—from the once cowardly admission of being a thief to proudly acknowledging his true nature as a thief.

(Through Sun Lingtong's recollections, the concept of "thief" is elevated.

Here, "thief" no longer refers merely to a surface-level "robber" but symbolizes a spirit of adventure, a challenge, a refusal to compromise with the outside world, and a firm adherence to one's true self.) There are multiple parallels within this literary scene.

For instance, the parallel between Zhu Xuanji and the judge.

Zhu Xuanji's encouragement of the judge also indirectly portrays Zhu Xuanji's true nature and personal ideals.

The parallels between Ning's criticisms and the judge, the powerful ministers, and the criminals.

These three represent the three facets of Ning Zhuo's personality.

The parallels between Sun Lingtong and Li Leifeng.

Zhu Xuanji wants to use Li Leifeng's influence to inspire Ning Zhuo, but ultimately fails.

This is because Sun Lingtong nurtured Ning Zhuo, awakening within him the elements of adventure, challenge, and resistance.

Li Leifeng, sitting high on the stage, sheds light on Ning Zhuo, just as Zhu Xuanji, lofty and distant, strives to win Ning Zhuo over.

But Sun Lingtong is different.

He is a friend, a brother, someone who stands alongside Ning Zhuo.

When Ning recalls his past with Sun Lingtong, he is actually coming to terms with himself.

So, when he sees his younger self in the audience, he sees Sun Lingtong.

When he finally understands his true nature and realizes who he really is, he is no longer confused.

Yun Shang once offered him a second path in life, Zhu Xuanji gave him a third, both causing him to hesitate.

But now, he will no longer hesitate.

From this moment on, he completes his psychological transformation and becomes a steadfast warrior who can maintain his original resolve!

And with this unwavering stance, he will face the final battle for the Lava Immortal Palace.

Such a plot design is even more challenging than "The Legend of the Human Ancestor." It involves a play within a play and so many characters, requiring an extremely intricate structure.

This level of design is relatively rare in online novels.

Consider this a small gift to all the readers who have supported this book.

Here, I must also apologize to everyone!

The climactic ending of the volume has been delayed again and again, making everyone wait anxiously.

I genuinely wanted to write up to the climax on time.

Really, I don't think anyone in this world wanted it more than I did.

But do you know something?

For the scene with the judge seeking justice, I initially estimated it would take me 3-5 drafts to finish it.

But I couldn’t do it!

Starting from Chapter 257 up until now, Chapter 266, it's already been 9 chapters.

And that doesn't even count the long chapters within those 9.

For example, Chapter 266, "I Will Ignite This Fire with My Own Hands," is 5,000 characters long.

Plans are beautiful, but in practice, it’s hard to estimate things accurately.

The main reason is that I’m innovating.

What I’m writing doesn’t have a reference point.

It’s not the typical "level up and fight, then level up and fight again" pattern.

Every character has their own thoughts, personality, logic, and varying levels of information.

They’re all colliding on the stage of Lava Immortal City, forming alliances, betraying each other, and constantly shifting.

This makes it very difficult for me to estimate accurately!

The upside is that the plot remains fresh, and readers can’t be sure how events will unfold.

In my twenty-plus years of reading online novels, I’ve never come across a plot like this.

The downside is that this kind of innovation is hard to predict.

Even as the creator, I find it difficult to estimate the word count.

Here, I apologize to everyone.

In the future, well...

I won't make predictions anymore.

I don’t even know which chapter will finally close out the first volume.

So maybe don’t expect too much.

The first volume might not have a grand climax; it could end up being similar to this smaller one, or maybe even worse.

I wonder, with this mindset, would it be better to continue reading this book?

Honestly, in my view, there’s no need to get angry while reading an online novel.

Our relationship should be a romantic one.

Thank you all for your support—there are so many leaders and so many readers buying extra chapters.

That’s why I’m pulling all-nighters, striving to innovate, and writing such plots.

This is our mutual response to each other.

Of course, I also worry that I might be getting too self-indulgent.

I’ve made that mistake often, especially with "Reverend Insanity" and even more so with "Infinite Bloodcore."

The outline for the first volume of "Mysteries of the Immortal Puppet Master" is fixed; it can’t be changed.

I simply don’t have the time to revise the outline.

Daily updates like these are something I’ve never done before.

Old friends know this well.

Haha.

After all, I’m a self-proclaimed slow writer.

To be honest, I’ve already given it my all! I’m literally bleeding while updating!!

If the writing becomes stiff or if you didn’t like today’s plot, that’s on me.

Well… let’s just say this is my final act of defiance.

The first major volume can only be like this; in the second volume, I will try to make some changes.

As for whether it will succeed or fail, I can't predict.

All I can say is that I’ve always been giving it my all to repay the support of the readers.

Once again, thank you all!
