Chapter 93: Who Would Suspect a Two-Year-Old Child?

Since Li Leifeng had already said so, Zhu Xuanji didn’t hold back. He immediately extended his hand and channeled magical power into Li Leifeng’s body. At the same time, his Golden Pupils emitted a divine radiance.

Very soon, Zhu Xuanji gained a clear understanding of Li Leifeng’s physical condition. His face instantly turned pale.

“Senior Li…”

Li Leifeng had been holding on for a while. Now, he finally couldn’t hold on any longer and began coughing violently.

His aura declined and fell down to the Qi Refining stage. Blood appeared at the corner of his mouth, and his face turned deathly pale.

“I’m already old. My body is decaying. Even just breathing is extremely difficult.

“No matter how gentle Sir Zhu’s magical power is, it still causes harm to this old body.

“But so be it.

“If I hadn’t had a fortunate encounter in my youth and consumed a life-extending mushroom, I wouldn’t have survived to this age.

“I still have to thank Sir Zhu for helping to free me.”

Zhu Xuanji sighed. His brows furrowed tightly, and he was unable to suppress his guilt. “Senior Li, your contributions to Children’s Care Garden are well known. Why do you have to do this?”

He was a smart man. Now that he’d fallen into the trap, he immediately saw through Li Leifeng’s ruse.

It made him feel terrible.

Li Leifeng laughed. “Sir Zhu, if you truly feel guilty… Please, on behalf of the court, find a good director for this Children's Care Garden. If not, I’ll have no peace even in death, and will perish with my eyes wide open.”

Zhu Xuanji raised his head and couldn’t help but sigh deeply.

His primary goal in this meeting was to investigate Li Leifeng.

Based on the intelligence he had gathered from the City Lord Mansion and the three great clans, Li Leifeng was without a doubt the number one suspect.

Though he had not yet reached the Golden Core stage, he possessed a lightning spirit root. At his peak, the mechanical pagoda he wielded granted him battle prowess half a step into Golden Core.

Moreover, he had profound accomplishments in mechanical arts. He had won the acknowledgment of the Lava Immortal Palace and was one of the few Foundation Establishment cultivators qualified to enter the palace.

According to the records of the four major forces, Li Leifeng had entered the immortal palace multiple times and obtained significant benefits.

And these were just the recorded instances.

Prior to the bombing of the Lava Immortal Palace, Fire Persimmon Mountain’s summit wasn’t under lockdown. Reaching the Scarlet Flame Monster Volcanic Cavern was much simpler, and many cultivators would disguise themselves and enter the cavern for exploration.

The four great forces could never have recorded every single cultivator who entered the immortal palace.

In other words, the number of times Li Leifeng entered the immortal palace far exceeded what was on record.

Now that Zhu Xuanji had personally examined him, he could confirm that Li Leifeng was near the end of his lifespan, with very little time remaining.

But even so, a dignified Golden Core cultivator like himself had been manipulated by this man.

Zhu Xuanji sighed inwardly.

It wasn’t the first time he’d fallen victim to such tricks.

The moment he appeared in public, those with intentions toward him would investigate his entire past and personal inclinations in detail.

What Li Leifeng did hit precisely upon Zhu Xuanji’s weaknesses.

Little people had their own ways of survival.

Zhu Xuanji knew that this investigation had likely shortened Li Leifeng’s life by at least three months.

Out of guilt, he could only promise to do his best to find an excellent director for the Children’s Care Center in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

Li Leifeng nodded with a smile. “Sir Zhu, after I pass away, there will be a meeting where all my belongings will be bequeathed to others.

“I know that you come from the royal family and are a divine investigator. You are wealthy beyond measure and hold great power and status.

“But I still want to gift you something as a show of respect.

“Of course, I don’t have any magic treasures that would catch your eye, but I do have a small toy I acquired by chance when I was young. It’s rather interesting.

“Please take a look, Sir Zhu.”

Zhu Xuanji received a wooden board.

This board was the size of a chopping board and was extraordinarily heavy. Its color was a pale yellow, and its surface was covered in natural wooden grain. Crisscrossing lines divided it into numerous smaller blocks.

Zhu Xuanji had a degree of proficiency in mechanical arts and was captivated with just one glance.

He touched one of the small blocks with his finger, and it smoothly slid to the side.

As expected, these blocks were all movable.

“Interesting.” Zhu Xuanji’s fingers flickered rapidly, moving blocks back and forth and gradually discovering the trick behind the board.

“This mechanical board is a puzzle board hiding a message. As you move the blocks into the correct places, parts of the message will slowly be revealed.

“And only once all the blocks have been moved into place will you be able to read the complete message.”

Zhu Xuanji frowned upon hearing this. “There are so many blocks. How long will it take to move them all into place and see the full message?”

Li Leifeng chuckled silently. “It’s just a toy, like the ones I used to play with as a child — things like One Round, Two Leg, Three Beard, and so on.

“It’s just that it’s quite complex and good for wasting time.”

Zhu Xuanji laughed. “Time is exactly what I need the most. How could I just waste it?”

Saying that, he activated his Golden Pupils.

With this cheat, he instantly obtained all the information hidden in the wooden toy. “Huh, it’s just an immortal tale? And an incomplete one, at that.”

Li Leifeng sighed. “Sir Zhu, it’s just a toy. If you ask me, it might have been created by some elderly mechanical cultivator while playing with his juniors.”

Zhu Xuanji nodded and put the mechanical board back. “I think this wooden board is better left with the Children's Care Center. Senior Li, I’ll take my leave now. Don’t worry, I won’t forget my promise.”

Li Leifeng said, “Sir Zhu, take care. Please forgive me for not being able to get up and see you off.”

Zhu Xuanji quickly waved his hands. “No, no, please, it’s better for you to just lie down.”

He was scared that Li Leifeng would really stand up and lose another chunk of lifespan to see him off.

As he walked out of the Children’s Care Center, Zhu Xuanji couldn’t help but sigh and raise his head to look at the sky. Muttering to himself, he said, “O heavens, why can’t you show a bit of mercy to the good people of this world?”

Zhu Xuanji’s mood was heavy. The knowledge of Li Leifeng’s impending death filled him with sorrow.

He would now have to spend time reporting to the court and personally participating in the selection of a new director for the Children's Care Center. All of this would drain his energy and delay his investigation.

However, he was willing.

…

Ning Zhuo did not sleep well in Ning Xiaoren’s residence.

In fact, it was even worse than in his uncle’s house.

The only place that gave him a true sense of peace was still that little courtyard that his mother had left for him.

Breakfast was plentiful, with an abundance of spirit food; Ning Xiaoren visited specifically to share the meal with Ning Zhuo.

He asked with concern how Ning Zhuo had slept the previous night and whether the food suited his taste.

Ning Zhuo appeared awkward and shy, unsure how to handle Ning Xiaoren’s kindness. Ning Xiaoren noticed this and tactfully toned down his enthusiasm.

Only then did Ning Zhuo gradually relax and begin to eat the spirit food. After all, this stuff could enhance his cultivation base.

Ning Xiaoren was surprised to find that Ning Zhuo was eating more and more and faster and faster, to the point that an entire dish was swallowed up in an instant.

Some of the side dishes were already small in portion size to begin with, and were just there for sampling. As a result, just as Ning Xiaoren lifted his chopsticks, they had already disappeared.

“Eat, eat well. If you like it, then eat more,” Ning Xiaoren said with a gentle smile.

Ning Zhuo’s chewing paused slightly, and he once again revealed an embarrassed expression.

Ning Xiaoren burst into laughter. “Good child, good child. The more you eat, the faster you can cultivate, and the more you’ll gain when exploring the immortal palace.”

“Fank… fank you, shunior patriarch,” Ning Zhuo mumbled, his mouth full and words unclear.

Ning Xiaoren laughed again. “I already told you, just call me Uncle Ning.”

Ning Zhuo obediently called out, “Uncle Ning!”

“Good, good. From now on, we’ll treat each other as uncle and nephew.” Ning Xiaoren stood up. “Eat well, now. Soon you should focus on cultivation; don’t waste any spirit stones. I heard you’re interested in mechanical arts? I’ll have someone send over some books for you to read later.”

Ning Zhuo immediately revealed a delighted expression. He stood up quickly and cupped his fists in gratitude.

Ning Xiaoren laughed heartily, waved his hand, and walked out of the room.

Once he returned to his study, his expression turned ice cold. Not getting a full breakfast in his own estate? This was a first. He had no choice but to order the house servants to prepare another round of food.

Meanwhile, Ning Zhuo was flipping through the mechanical arts books.

These books clearly came from the Ning Clan’s secret archives. Their quality was a level higher than those available in the public library.

On the surface, Ning Zhuo appeared fully engrossed, but his mind was actually elsewhere.

Any other day, his thirst for knowledge would have left him unable to put down the book once he had them in his hands.

But now, he was fully aware of his situation.

Even though Ning Xiaoren was currently showing him kindness, the junior patriarch may very well turn on him the next moment and throw him into a private dungeon.

Ning Zhuo was taking a dangerous gamble.

But he had no choice.

Yuan Dasheng’s appearance had forced him to personally enter the game, taking a huge risk in order to eliminate a formidable enemy. Now, he was just a hair’s breadth away from being exposed.

Zhu Xuanji had arrived too soon! The man’s constant investigation created enormous pressure and left Ning Zhuo with no other choice but to act swiftly.

“When did my situation become so precarious?”

Looking back, it was from the moment he decided to bomb the immortal palace.

Once that decision was made, it was like stepping into a solitary boat amid crashing waves. He had to reach the other shore to survive.

The slightest mistake, the slightest hesitation, and the boat would be smashed.

There was no getting off now.

If the immortal palace fell into someone else’s hands, they would inevitably investigate the explosion and discover that Ning Zhuo was true culprit.

His only option was to keep moving forward, clenching his teeth and facing every difficulty head-on. No matter what, he had to keep moving forward.

“The night passed, and Ning Xiaoren is still treating me kindly. In other word, their investigation has reached a satisfactory conclusion.

“All of this is thanks to the defenses I’ve been preparing since I was two years old. The pieces of fabricated evidence I’ve prepared are interwoven naturally into my life story.

“As long as they investigate those things, they’ll find plausible explanations and believe I simply have talent in mechanical arts.

“Even if they search the underground workshop, it won’t matter. I’ve already cleaned it up. I left behind numerous drafts for the explosive fire monkey blueprint, early-stage prototypes of failed mechanisms, and so on.”

Although Ning Zhuo was alone and unsupported, he had one advantage.

He had started preparing more than ten years ago. Throughout his years of growth, he deliberately planted many traces and clues.

When collected, these clues and pieces of information would form a plausible narrative.

And this narrative was actually Ning Zhuo’s carefully crafted personal defense. After all, who would ever think that a two-year-old child had been acting all along?

As long as his Early Wisdom innate talent remained undiscovered, Ning Zhuo would temporarily remain safe.

Of course, Ning Zhuo’s obsession with mechanical arts wasn’t an act. It was genuine.

“Ning Zhuo, come out.” Before long, Ning Xiaohui’s voice suddenly called from outside.
