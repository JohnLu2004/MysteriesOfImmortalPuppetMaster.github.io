Chapter 400: Linghu Jiu vs. Ning Zhuo 

White light mist rapidly spread outward, creating a space within a few breaths that would serve as their battlefield.

Ning Zhuo sighed, stepped forward through the crowd, and stood before Linghu Jiu's projection.

Ning Zhuo disliked fighting unprepared battles. In his mind, combat was dangerous and every engagement required extreme caution.

After all, once combat began, it meant all other options had been exhausted, making it truly a last resort.

But the current situation was special. Whether it was Lin Bufan, Shen Lingshu, Zhu Xuanji, or the Five Elements Divine Lord - they all wanted Ning Zhuo to fight.

Given the circumstances, Ning Zhuo, being just a small Foundation Establishment cultivator, could only comply.

"This battle must be won," Ning Jiufan watched Ning Zhuo's back and sighed inwardly. "Clever as you are, you must understand this isn't a simple contest?"

Ning Zhuo certainly knew.

Linghu Jiu's projection's challenge was indeed unexpected, coming from the Law Body of Sword Lord Ji Yin within the Linglong Mirror Wall, rather than Zhu Xuanji's or Lin Bufan's arrangement.

But this battle still concerned the division of benefits from this venture and the future relationship between the Ning clan and the Wanyao Sect.

If Ning Zhuo won, the Ning family would gain more benefits and earn more respect from the Wanyao Sect. The opposite was also true.

Ning Zhuo was determined to win, but still spoke the customary pleasantries: "Elder Brother Linghu, I remember our joyful drinking together. Today's battle is truly not what this junior brother desires."

But Linghu Jiu shook his head: "Dear brother, to be honest, I've long wanted to spar with you. Today I'm taking this opportunity - please fight with all your might!"

Linghu Jiu was quite straightforward. With a flick of his wrist, he performed a sword flourish and immediately charged at Ning Zhuo.

"I look forward to learning from you!" Ning Zhuo formed hand seals and charged forward as well.

He had never faced a Foundation Establishment cultivator skilled with weapons in such direct close combat before, and held many expectations.

Sword Technique - Cup Overflowing

Linghu Jiu's sword swept through the air, forming an ethereal trail. Like an overfilled wine cup, it trembled slightly, precise to perfection.

Ning Zhuo's hands manifested blood Veins, forming a defense that blocked the sword's edge.

However, Linghu Jiu didn't press the attack, merely skimming the surface like ripples on water.

This was unusual. Ning Zhuo was slightly surprised, thinking: if you won't attack, then I will.

Ning Zhuo took the initiative, closing in on Linghu Jiu.

Linghu Jiu gave a light laugh, saying: "Brother, prepare yourself."

Sword Technique - Wine's Floating Fragrance

In an instant, his sword transformed from solid to ethereal, sword intent gushing forth like spreading wine fragrance, soft yet aggressive.

The attacks came in waves!

Ning Zhuo could only retreat, retreat, and retreat further.

After several offensive moves, Linghu Jiu suddenly withdrew and switched to defense.

Lin Shanshan exclaimed in recognition: "That's the Wine Forest Sword Technique that my senior brother and I created together!"

Everyone turned to look at her.

Lin Shanshan smiled sheepishly and explained the origin.

It turned out that when Linghu Jiu was confined in the Ten Thousand Demons Cave, bored to extremes, his mind wandered and he thought of creating his own sword technique.

When Lin Shanshan brought him food, Linghu Jiu showed off his creation, but this made Lin Shanshan quite angry.

Because Linghu Jiu's sword techniques were all named after wine, fully revealing his intense longing for alcohol.

Lin Shanshan couldn't stand this and actively participated in creating the sword technique, adding her own concepts, hoping to use this method to persuade her senior brother to quit drinking!

Wine Forest Sword Technique - Wine Knows a Friend

Linghu Jiu's sword consolidated again, transforming from ethereal to solid. The sword tip thrust forward, clearly fierce yet giving a warm and friendly feeling, as if inviting one to drink together!

Ning Zhuo couldn't dodge in time and his shoulder was struck, though fortunately the Demonic Blood Vein Technique protected him from the sharp blade.

Ning Zhuo broke out in cold sweat and hurriedly retreated.

Linghu Jiu's sword attacks continued relentlessly, forcing Ning Zhuo to dodge frantically.

Seeing this, Lin Shanshan clapped and laughed: "Senior Brother, well done! Teach this big head a good lesson!"

Hearing these words, Linghu Jiu's projection became even more energetic, smiling: "Little junior sister, watch carefully then."

Wine Forest Sword Technique - Drinking Among Clouds

Linghu Jiu's sword moves suddenly became wild and unrestrained, like a drunk person dancing without pattern, yet somehow more lethal than ever.

Ning Zhuo couldn't discern the pattern, feeling sword strikes coming from bizarre and unpredictable angles, making defense difficult. He took several hits in quick succession.

Several times, the sword tip struck the same spot repeatedly, breaking through the Blood Vein protection and wounding Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo quickly retreated, using the Demon-Stained Blood Vein technique to rapidly heal his wounds.

His open use of demonic techniques before everyone was essentially a public revelation of his nature.

Usually, righteous cultivators would criticize those who practiced demonic arts. But seeing both Lin Bufan and Zhu Xuanji remain unmoved, as if they'd known all along, others could only accept it too.

Lin Shanshan's expression briefly froze.

Ning Zhuo's injuries suddenly made her realize that while her senior brother was just a projection, Ning Zhuo was flesh and blood. In this match, Ning Zhuo was in far more danger.

But quickly, Lin Shanshan became angry with herself: "Why am I worried about him?"

"This big head Ning Zhuo, he clearly had techniques he could use in close combat, but he's been deceiving me all along!"

Wine Forest Sword Technique - Cease After Satisfaction

Linghu Jiu's sword moved like rapid drinking, swift and fierce, as if wanting to completely destroy the enemy. But suddenly, at the peak of his assault, he stopped abruptly, switching to defense, transforming into flowing sword qi to protect himself.

This made him miss a perfect opportunity to attack - he should have pressed his advantage for victory, but instead voluntarily withdrew.

The spectators understood why.

This was because the Wine Forest Sword Technique was jointly created by Linghu Jiu and Lin Shanshan, but their concepts clashed. Linghu Jiu wanted to drink, while Lin Shanshan wanted him to quit. This reflected in the sword technique, switching suddenly between offense and defense, making it unpredictable.

When Linghu Jiu retreated, Ning Zhuo took the initiative to attack.

He gradually adapted to the Wine Forest Sword Technique and began to turn the tide.

"This sword technique isn't particularly sophisticated - it's quite fractured."

"One part is precise and strict, while another part is loose and freeform!"

Ning Zhuo called out: "Elder Brother Linghu, if you think you can defeat me with this sword technique, aren't you underestimating me?"

Lin Shanshan inwardly snorted: "This stinking big head, barely getting stable and already becoming arrogant. We're not even close to finished! Senior Brother hasn't shown his true strength yet."

"Though speaking of which, Ning Zhuo is indeed clever. How long has he been at Small Peak? He's improved so much in close combat. I still remember when he first came..."

Lin Shanshan felt proud, reminiscing about her time spent with Ning Zhuo.

"Hmph! This stinking big head kidnapped me and even exploited me publically, he has ill intentions!" Lin Shanshan quickly stopped her wandering thoughts.

Wine Forest Sword Technique - Drunken Retention

While Linghu Jiu seemed defensive, his defense gradually gained the upper hand.

Ning Zhuo was wounded again and had to retreat.

Zhu Xuanji suddenly chuckled: "This sword technique is becoming interesting."

It turned out that Drunken Retention, while appearing defensive, contained hidden offensive power. It was like a carefully laid trap, enticing the enemy to keep attacking.

Ning Zhuo seemed to have the advantage, but the sword wind kept entering his body, causing many small injuries. Though the sword wind seemed minor, the accumulation of hits became significant.

While the earlier sword techniques showed the conflicting concepts of Linghu Jiu and Lin Shanshan, causing the technique to be fragmented with poor combat effectiveness, this move unexpectedly unified their opposing ideas, creating an unexpected effect.

Wine Forest Sword Technique - Smelling Wine Through a Curtain

Linghu Jiu's sword moves remained profound, like smelling wine fragrance through a curtain, primarily defensive.

But Ning Zhuo felt a strong hidden threat.

This was because he had drunk with Linghu Jiu before, and now understood the psychological state behind this sword technique's creation.

Smelling wine through a curtain... Linghu Jiu's desire blocked by a thin curtain. How could such a flimsy barrier contain his longing for fine wine?

Once that desire burst forth, the wine's fragrance would surely be overwhelming.

Ning Zhuo quickly retreated!

Seeing his sword move miss, Linghu Jiu felt both disappointed and pleased: "Brother Ning Zhuo, you understand me well."

"But can you handle this move?"

The final move of the Wine Forest Sword Technique - Raise the Cup to Banish Worries!

In an instant, Linghu Jiu pulled back his sword defensively, yet his sword intent spread like rushing water, both sorrowful and pleasant, expressing inner frustration that could only be relieved through drinking.

It was both attack and defense, physical restraint yet emotional release!

Ning Zhuo was hit!

Blood sprayed as a huge wound appeared on his chest.

The Blood Vein's defense might as well have been paper.

The spectators' expressions changed.

Even Lin Bufan, with his Nascent Soul cultivation, showed surprise. This was because he saw shadows of a profound secret manual in this sword technique.

"The Ji Yan Sword Classic?"

Ning Zhuo retreated repeatedly, hurriedly consuming pills while frantically operating the Demonic Blood Vein technique to heal.

Though the bleeding stopped, the wound didn't immediately heal. Sword intent lingered around the wound, preventing its dispersal and greatly hindering Ning Zhuo's self-healing.

"The Wine Forest Sword Technique... I wonder how it compares to my self-created blade technique?" Within the Mechanical Dragon, Sun Lingdong felt the urge to fight.

"How formidable!" Ning Zhuo praised loudly.

He wasn't frustrated at all, maintaining a good attitude.

This was because he knew Linghu Jiu had immersed himself in close-combat sword techniques for years - how long had Ning Zhuo spent in comparison?

There was no comparison.

It was normal to lose!

"I've learned so much!" This exchange gave Ning Zhuo many insights and great gains.

He wished he could continue sparring with Linghu Jiu in this way until he lost.

"But given the current situation, I'd better win."

This battle's significance went far beyond mere sparring - it concerned the future of the Ning family and Wanyao Sect, and related to the bet between the Five Elements Divine Lord and Sword Lord Ji Yan.

"The probing ends here. I'll get serious now!"

"Elder Brother Linghu, please receive this move."

After this declaration, Ning Zhuo took a deep breath, his expression becoming solemn as he quickly deployed Wood Element magic.

Root Entanglement!

Roots and vines materialized in the air, swiftly entangling Linghu Jiu.

Close combat... was merely Ning Zhuo's weakness. The Five Elements magic, however, was becoming his strength!
