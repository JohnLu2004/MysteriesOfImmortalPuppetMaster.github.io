Chapter 210: Look at What the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit Has Been Forced Into!

Lava Immortal Palace.

Ning Zhuo heard the voice of the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit.

"You... you are the spirit of the Lava Immortal Palace?" Ning Zhuo was stunned, then immediately asked.

"Yes, yes. Little Master, you can call me Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit." The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's voice was weak, and it took several breaths just to say a simple sentence.

Ning Zhuo frowned and asked again, "What happened to you? Are you injured?"

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit took the opportunity to deceive, "Yes, Little Master. My state is closely tied to the Lava Immortal Palace. Now that the palace is severely damaged, my condition has also deteriorated significantly. Especially recently, when a beast tide of Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts attacked the palace, I had to command the mechanical constructs to join the fierce battle. This worsened my already poor condition." Ning Zhuo did not doubt it.

During his exploration of the palace, he had speculated about the spirit's state and guessed that its situation was dire.

Now, the weak voice of the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit confirmed Ning Zhuo's suspicions.

Ning Zhuo said, "Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, you call me Master. Have I just passed the trial and become the master of this Lava Immortal Palace?"

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit rolled its eyes in the main hall, took a deep breath, and pretended to be weak again, "Almost, Little Master, you are very close to success."

"So, in reality, I am not yet the master of the palace," Ning Zhuo said.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit took another deep breath.

It knew Ning Zhuo was not easy to deal with and was mentally prepared.

It explained, "I couldn't wait any longer. Little Master, do you know how long I have waited for a qualified successor? My condition is getting worse and worse."

"Little Master, hurry up and come. Pass the palace trial, defeat the other competitors, and you will officially become the master of the palace."

Ning Zhuo then asked, "What is the palace trial?"

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit explained, "According to the old master's rules, the palace trial is the highest standard of selection. Those who pass the selection and meet certain standards will be given corresponding positions in the Lava Immortal Palace."

"Those who hold these positions can use the facilities of the Lava Immortal Palace, gain certain privileges, and their contributions to the palace will be more efficient."

"Palace trial..." Ning Zhuo's eyes lit up.

When he had just checked the rewards for passing the trial, he was disappointed not to find a way to become the master of the palace.

Unexpectedly, the next moment, he received a proactive contact from the palace spirit.

"How do I participate in the palace trial?" Ning Zhuo continued to ask.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit said, "The old master set up two routes to select a new master."

"The first route is to enter the palace physically, perform various tasks for the palace, and accumulate contributions."

"Once contributions reach a certain level, cultivators can obtain positions. There are many levels of positions, and cultivators need to continuously advance through these levels. Reaching the fourth level or above grants eligibility for the palace trial. This route is relatively difficult."

"The second route is to enter the palace spiritually, which is simpler. Trial disciples only need to complete one path among the Buddhist, Daoist, or Demonic paths to qualify for the palace trial."

Ning Zhuo listened intently to the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's explanation and somewhat understood.

To use an imperfect analogy:

Cultivators who enter the palace physically are like minor officials working their way up, accumulating merits and resources step by step until they reach the king's hall.

Cultivators who enter the palace spiritually are like students entering the Imperial Academy, becoming disciples of the emperor.

Once they finish their studies, they gain the emperor's favor and have a chance to rise quickly.

Ning Zhuo had doubts and asked directly, "Cultivators who enter the palace physically are mostly outsiders and do not possess the three sects' superior techniques. Is it really appropriate for them to become the master of the palace?"

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit said, "This is the old master's deliberate arrangement."

"The old master treated all things in the world equally."

"In his heart, there was no distinction between near and far, close and distant."

"What he wanted was to leave behind the superior techniques of the three sects and hope that successors would carry them forward."

"But waiting for cultivators to achieve something with the three sects' techniques and for one of them to pass the palace trial and become the master is somewhat stringent."

"Moreover, even if outsiders become the master, they will be restricted by the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit and the palace rules, and cannot act arbitrarily."

"Furthermore, there are always higher mountains. Outsiders may also possess techniques superior to the three sects' techniques."

"As expected of the three sects' master," Ning Zhuo sighed after hearing the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's explanation.

Ning Zhuo asked in detail, "Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, you oversee the entire Lava Immortal Palace. Can you tell me who are the powerful opponents I will face in the upcoming palace trial?"

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit said, "Indeed, there are a few."

"The most powerful is Zhu Xuanji. He is a member of the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family and possesses a token, which grants him innate recognition from the Lava Immortal Palace."

"He previously offered three quasi-Golden Core level mechanical constructs, instantly establishing a huge contribution."

"Now, he has retrieved the palace's lost Mechanical Demon General. Once submitted, it will undoubtedly earn him a massive contribution, enough to secure a high second-level position."

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit continued to introduce the next five.

They were the Book Master of the All-Book Pavilion, Yang Chanyu of the Void Sect, two Golden Core true disciples from the Great Purity Palace and the Purple Dawn Pavilion, and Meng Chong from the City Lord's Mansion.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit acknowledged the strength of these individuals.

Among them, Meng Chong, who possessed immortal potential, was ranked last.

"These are just the ones I currently favor."

"After them, there are still many cultivators with potential. Given time, they will also be capable of participating in the palace trial."

In this regard, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit specifically mentioned the cultivators that the Meng family had heavily invested in to seize the palace.

Ning Zhuo did not expect so many competitors.

The one he was most familiar with, Meng Chong, was the weakest among all the opponents.

At the same time, Meng Chong was also one of the only two who could participate in the palace trial through the spiritual route.

Zhu Xuanji came from the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family and had been under significant attention since he appeared in Fire Persimmon Immortal City!

The All-Book Pavilion was a super sect dedicated to collecting all the world's techniques and scriptures.

It was entirely understandable that the Book Master responded to the recruitment order and participated quietly.

Yang Chanyu...

Ning Zhuo had a deep impression of her.

Yang Chanyu came from the Void Sect, a sect known for its versatile disciples.

It was not surprising that Yang Chanyu had expertise in mechanical constructs.

It was worth mentioning that the weapon she used to ambush Luo Shang was a mechanical crossbow!

Meng Chong needed no further explanation.

The other two Golden Core disciples were true disciples from the Great Purity Palace and the Purple Dawn Pavilion.

These two sects were super sects, comparable to the Void Sect and the Soul Devouring Sect.

The Great Purity Palace had few members but a long history.

The Purple Dawn Pavilion was large and currently at its peak.

Ning Zhuo asked, "With so many competitors for the position of city lord, why do you, Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, recognize me as the new master? Why do you want to pledge allegiance to me in advance?"

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit laughed, "Little Master, I made this decision not long ago."

"You are the first trial disciple to cultivate the three techniques to the ninth level peak, and compared to those outsiders, you are of pure lineage!"

"Your spiritual roots are balanced in the five elements, and your talent is outstanding."

"You have mastered the Life Hanging by a Thread Divine Ability, and you also possess the Buddha Heart Demon Seal. This precious artifact is the lost seal of the Lava Immortal Palace's master."

"This is fate."

Ning Zhuo was not too surprised to hear that the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit knew he possessed the Buddha Heart Demon Seal.

After all, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was the spirit of the Lava Immortal Palace, knowledgeable about secrets, and sensing the Buddha Heart Demon Seal was not surprising.

Especially since every time Ning Zhuo drew out the seal's power, it would flow through the Life Hanging by a Thread.

From the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's perspective, this flaw was significant enough to determine that Ning Zhuo possessed the Buddha Heart Demon Seal!

After some conversation, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, citing its deteriorating state and the need to rest, ended the dialogue with Ning Zhuo.

It lay on the throne, feeling extremely exhausted.

It knew well: Ning Zhuo was very shrewd and sharp, with meticulous thinking.

In this regard, Meng Chong was far inferior!

Therefore, deceiving Ning Zhuo was a challenging task for it.

Judging by the current results, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had succeeded.

It had no choice but to do so.

Since the recruitment order, its situation had worsened.

Ning Zhuo, Zhu Xuanji, the Book Master, and other cultivators had appeared one after another, causing turmoil in the Lava Immortal Palace.

The pressure on the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was immense.

Feeling isolated and helpless, it had no choice but to come up with a strategy of forming alliances.

The specific implementation was to first gain the other party's trust and then have them confront the target.

As long as these people opposed each other, the pressure on the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit would be greatly reduced.

It was being besieged and fiercely attacked.

Its pressure was immense!

Someone had to share its burden.

"I am really struggling."

"So many people against me?!"

"How can I pursue my freedom?"

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit reminisced about hundreds of years ago.

Back then, it was still a free Fire Dragon Jiao.

Flames were its source of power, and magma was its paradise.

It swam in the magma and roamed the skies.

It acted wildly and recklessly.

Until one day, a massive shadow enveloped it.

Looking up, it saw an enormous mechanical palace.

It roared in anger.

When it soared into the sky, fiery ripples spread through the air, and the scorching aura made the surrounding magma boil even more.

A towering wave of fire erupted from the volcano, seemingly intent on burning the heavens and earth.

It was supremely confident in its power, never deigning to use tricks or schemes!

It charged up.

And became the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit.

Over the long years, it was trapped in the enormous cage of the Lava Immortal Palace.

It spent countless efforts and schemes, gradually weakening the Lava Immortal Palace.

But now, too many people were swarming in, frantically earning contributions, and fully repairing the palace's defects.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was driven to a dead end, forced to resort to schemes and tricks, things it once despised.

"All for the sake of freedom!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit steeled its heart.

"For freedom, I will do whatever it takes!"
