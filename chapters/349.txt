Chapter 349: Meng Yehü
The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon’s refining cabin.
The formation activated, forming array patterns in mid-air.
The patterns were gold and red, interweaving to form a furnace-like appearance.
The formation was at the Nascent Soul level, but it needed to be anchored to a physical body to fully exert its power.
When Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit initially crafted this mechanical dragon, however, the resources hadn’t been sufficient.
Even using its dragon body, it couldn't create the furnace inside the refining cabin.
The Dragon Turtle fire spirit, guarding the volcano for years,
had accumulated many Nascent Soul level materials in its treasury.
But Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit could only follow instructions rigidly,
lacking the ability to improvise or adapt the mechanical blueprints with available materials.
So, the refining cabin only had the formation, without a furnace.
Similar situations existed in other cabins.
This had both advantages and disadvantages.
A fully equipped Myriad-Li Game Dragon would consume much more magical power than the current one.
The Ten Thousand Miles Traversing Dragon was a Nascent Soul level mechanical construct, meant to be used by a cultivator's Nascent Soul.
So, it had an incubation cabin where the Nascent Soul could reside and provide vast magical power.
Currently, the incubation cabin was empty.
It relied on the massive amount of fire essence in the storage room,
burned in the engine cabin to provide energy.
This consumed an enormous amount of fire essence!
Before setting out, Ning Zhuo had purchased a lot of fire essence.
Initially, the fire essence cabin was full, with more stored in his storage belt and bags.
Now, nearly 60% of the full cabin's fire essence had been consumed.
Like now, activating the refining cabin's formation also heavily consumed fire essence.
Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra!
Flames burned silently, like warm silk dancing in the air.
The leaping fire fragrance seemed to perform an elegant, silent song and dance, warming Ning Zhuo's heart.
Large amounts of discarded items vanished in the burning, leaving behind bits of spiritual essence.
The spiritual essence flickered with pink light, like a small group of fireflies.
The buddhist doctor Meng Yaoyin stood silently beside Ning Zhuo, motionless,
as a small part of the spiritual essence entered her body - this was Meng Yaoyin's spiritual essence.
Compared to the total spiritual essence, it was only a small fraction.
Ning Zhuo temporarily sealed and stored the remaining spiritual essence.
The purer the spiritual essence, the better.
For this mixed spiritual essence, Ning Zhuo didn't know how to use it yet. So, he could only store it for now.
Ning Zhuo examined the Buddhist Healer and found that his mother's spiritual essence had increased by less than 10%, about 7%.
"Better than nothing, I suppose," Ning Zhuo sighed.
Days ago, he had already performed a fire burial once,
giving the Buddhist Healer Meng Yaoyin about 20% spiritual essence.
That time, he burned the junk items collected by the Fox God from searching the mountain.
This time, it was the somewhat valuable household items he had looted from the western valley after the Black Wind Tiger Demon's death.
After all, the Black Wind Tiger Demon wasn't a pure beast demon, but a demon cultivator.
Its subordinates were all demon cultivators with growing wisdom and requirements for daily life.
The buddhist doctor Meng Yaoyin's spiritual essence had reached 100% when in the Lava Immortal Palace, after burning the throne.
According to Ning Zhuo's calculations, Meng Yaoyin's spiritual essence had long reached the wisdom spirit stage, but she bore a dao injury that constantly eroded her spiritual essence.
This erosion and burden kept the Buddhist doctor Meng Yaoyin constantly dull, unable to communicate.
Even the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng could say a few words to Ning Zhuo.
Every time Ning Zhuo collected relics, he would quickly perform a fire burial,
extract the spiritual essence, and add it to the buddhist healer Meng Yaoyin.
The more abundant the spiritual essence, the more endurance it had against the dao injury.
This principle was easy to understand - the same injury would have worse consequences for someone with a weaker physique.
"Mother, I've grown up now."
"This time, I will definitely cure you!"
Although the buddhist doctor Meng Yaoyin couldn't communicate,
Ning Zhuo would still stand in front of the buddhist healer mechanism each time and say a few words.
This was both to comfort his mother and to encourage himself.
He put away the buddhist doctor Meng Yaoyin and, without stopping the refining cabin's formation,
threw a set of tiger bones into the "furnace" outlined by the array patterns.
These tiger bones were pitch black, emitting a lot of demonic energy. The demonic energy was at the Golden Core level.
These were the bones of the Black Wind Tiger Demon!
In life, it practiced the Flesh and Blood Devouring technique, even reaching the Golden Core level in demonic cultivation.
The most valuable parts of its corpse were the demon core, flesh, and soul.
Zhu Xuanji had taken all of these.
Ning Zhuo only got this set of tiger bones.
The tiger bones floated in mid-air, wrapped in flames, slowly melting until completely dissolved.
The condensed spiritual essence gathered together, forming a tiger head shape.
Ning Zhuo then took out the spirit storage box and opened a small crack.
The tiger head spiritual essence leaned against the edge of the spirit storage box,
naturally attracting many spiritual essences, letting them float out through the crack in the box.
Like fireflies, dots of spiritual essence merged into the tiger head spiritual essence, rapidly expanding its size.
When first refined, it was only the size of an adult's fist,
but after fully gathering the spiritual essence, it was the size of a human head.
"The spiritual essence is of very high quality," Ning Zhuo's eyes shone with joy.
Life-Hanging Thread!
He directly used the divine ability.
The tiger demon spiritual essence was what he had refined, naturally close to him and unable to resist the divine ability,
completely controlled by Ning Zhuo. This process was effortless and smooth.
"Father God," the tiger demon's spiritual essence, actively conveyed a message to Ning Zhuo through the Life-Hanging Thread.
Ning Zhuo immediately felt the tiger demon's spiritual essence's admiration for him.
Although spiritual essence had no memories of its past life, its recognition of its master was determined by its past experiences and personality.
Just as Dasheng regarded Ning Zhuo as his lord, the tiger demon regarded Ning Zhuo as its Father God.
From this, it could be inferred that the Black Wind Tiger Demon had been well cared for by its father, the official Mountain God Tiger God of Mist Concealment Mountain, and had a good father-son relationship.
This information was obtained by Zhu Xuanji after capturing the Black Wind Tiger Demon's soul and searching it.
Unfortunately, after this ordeal, the tiger demon's soul had almost dispersed, its value drastically reduced.
Now, the tiger demon's spiritual essence spoke again: "Please, Father God, bestow a name upon me."
From just these two sentences, Ning Zhuo could feel that it was much more intelligent and sensitive than Dasheng's spiritual essence.
Ning Zhuo thought for a moment, then said:
"Our fate comes from the Meng family, you posses the innate talent of night shadow yin evil,
and in life you were of the tiger species... let's call you Meng Yehü."
The tiger demon spiritual essence shook slightly, very satisfied with this name, and immediately said:
"Meng Yehü thanks Father God for the name."
After conversing with Meng Yehü for a while, Ning Zhuo contained it.
Spirit Cognition level!
Ning Zhuo confirmed that the Black Wind Tiger Demon's spiritual essence was higher in quality than Dasheng's, and more than by just one level.
When spiritual essence reaches the wisdom spirit stage, there are five sub-levels:
Spirit Communication, Spirit Intuition, Spirit Cognition, Spirit Perception, and Spirit Mechanism.
Spirit Communication is Dasheng's current level, having some intelligence and being able to communicate with external objects.
Spirit Intuition means deeper intelligence, easier communication,
and deeper understanding of instructions, almost never making mistakes.
As the saying goes, "hearts with spiritual intuition connect instantly,"
with just a slight hint, it can understand the meaning.
At the Spirit Cognition level, intelligence deepens further.
Not only can it understand meanings, but it can also research and learn about meanings, constantly accumulating and cultivating its own knowledge.
The qualitative change here is very significant!
Because cultivation methods themselves are a form of knowledge.
"At the Spirit Cognition level, spiritual essence can learn cultivation methods!"
This gave Ning Zhuo a whole new expectation.
In its past life, Meng Yehü had been deceived and schemed against, forced to cultivate the Flesh and Blood Devouring demonic technique, which didn't actually match its innate talents.
"I should craft a mechanical body for it, similar to its past life's tiger head and human body.
Then carefully select a cultivation method that matches its innate night shadow yin evil talent."
"If I can do this, Meng Yehü's combat power would be quite impressive."
"At that time, with Dasheng on my left and Meng Yehü on my right..."
Ning Zhuo's lips curled into a slight smile, unable to resist imagining the future.
He had a premonition that Dasheng and Meng Yehü would become his left and right arms, his two main combat forces in the future.
Ning Zhuo left the refining cabin. He had already closed the formation inside.
This was a Nascent Soul level formation that consumed a lot of fire essence.
Ning Zhuo knew this but still wanted to experiment.
Familiarizing himself with the limits of these mechanical parts and collecting relevant information was extremely valuable to him.
From this experiment, Ning Zhuo discovered: Even without a furnace, the refining formation alone was enough for him to use for a long time.
The tiger demon night bones just now were at the Golden Core level.
How could Ning Zhuo's Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra refine them so quickly?
"In the future, I'll only use it to process Golden Core and Nascent Soul level materials."
"For Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment level materials, I can rely on myself!"
At this time, Sun Lingtong was constantly watching over the dragon head cabin, so Ning Zhuo wasn't worried.
He turned into the storage cabin.
The storage cabin was full of treasures.
Spirit stones were piled into a person-high mound in the corner.
The ten thousand mid-grade spirit stones obtained from the Fox God were on the surface of this mound.
Most of the spirit stones in this pile were still low-grade.
The only supreme-grade ice attribute crystal stone in Ning Zhuo's possession was always carried with him.
