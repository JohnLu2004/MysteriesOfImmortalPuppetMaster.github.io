Chapter 281: Who Set This Damn "Entry Standard"?!

Palace Examination!

Thirty-three names on the leaderboard!

A single stone stirs up a thousand waves.

At the same time, cultivators who received this information were almost all stunned in place.

Zhu Xuanji's heart sank: "Palace Examination?!"

His first thought was: "Does passing the Palace Examination mean I can obtain the position of Palace Master?" As a divine constable, renowned throughout the nation, his mind was meticulous, able to deduce many things from key information.

"The mechanism of the Lava Immortal Palace includes a standard for selecting successors, which rises and falls with the state of the palace. Now, with the palace greatly damaged, this mechanism has been activated, thus starting the Palace Examination!" "This Palace Examination is highly likely to select the next Palace Master."

"The information is clearâ€”there are thirty-three names on the Palace Examination list! This means my main competitors are the other thirty-two people." Zhu Xuanji began to carefully study this list.

He first saw his own name.

He was not surprised to be ranked first. After repairing the Mechanical Demon General, seeing no hope of retrieving the Demonic Dao Scripture in a short time, he submitted it.

As a result, he received a huge amount of merit.

This is also why he recently handed the Golden Phoenix Mirror to Ning Xiaohui.

"The second is the Book Master." "The All-Book Pavilion..."

Zhu Xuanji's gaze deepened. This neutral sect had quietly reached this point.

If not for this leaderboard, Zhu Xuanji wouldn't have known the Book Master had disguised himself so well and made such significant progress, yet everyone seemed to have forgotten about him.

The third was Zheng Danlian.

"Zheng Danlian had been in and out of the Lava Immortal Palace for a long time, so his accumulation of merit began long ago. Not only does he have an old foundation, but he also now possesses a powerful killing weapon."

"His Night Rain Demon Weapon is quite unusual, helping him recently slay the most golden core stage scarlet flame beasts, thus earning a large amount of merit." "Ranking third is understandable." Zhu Xuanji then looked at the fourth, fifth, and sixth positions.

These three positions were also occupied by golden core cultivators, but their names were quite unfamiliar.

Zhu Xuanji sneered, knowing very well: these three, along with a few others, were brought in as reinforcements by a certain family.

Don't be fooled by the lack of connection in names, origins, or techniques, but from their actions and performance, Zhu Xuanji had already identified their faction.

These people's names were unimportant; in Zhu Xuanji's mind, they automatically became Meng Family Golden Core A, Meng Family Golden Core B, Meng Family Golden Core C, D, and so on.

After this, Zhu Xuanji saw Zheng Shuangjun, Zhou Nongying, and several golden core rogue cultivators A, B, C, and Ning Jiufan.

"Ning Jiufan's ranking being lower indicates he hasn't been in the Lava Immortal Palace for long." He also saw the Purple Dawn Pavilion's golden core true disciple, Zhu Zhen, and Song Fuli.

The presence of a Purple Dawn Pavilion golden core true disciple was not surprising.

Zhu Zhen himself had mechanical expertise, and his support for Zhu Xuanji was undoubtedly all-out. Therefore, he also gained a lot of merit. This could be seen from the leaderboard.

The reason for his lower ranking was simply because he hadn't been here long, and compared to other golden core cultivators, he lacked their old accumulation.

Song Fuli was the same, suffering from the lack of old accumulation, hence his lower ranking.

Zhu Xuanji noticed that among these cloud merchants, there was not only Song Fuli as a golden core entrant but also two others.

These two names were also automatically replaced by Zhu Xuanji as Cloud Merchant Golden Core A and Cloud Merchant Golden Core B.

The last golden core cultivator was Yang Chanyu.

Seeing this name, Zhu Xuanji snorted coldly, a fierce glint flashing in his eyes.

"Void Sect, Yang Chanyu, I will do my utmost to bring you to justice!" He continued to look down.

"Ning Zhuo?"

Ning Zhuo's ranking was right next to Yang Chanyu.

"Unexpectedly, this kid became the top among the trial disciples. Where is Meng Chong?" Zhu Xuanji smiled slightly.

Though a bit surprised, he wasn't too shocked. After all, he had already deeply understood Ning Zhuo's mechanical expertise.

This junior Ning Zhuo had been recognized by Li Leifeng since childhood, showing an astonishing talent for mechanical arts from a young age!

Zhu Xuanji looked further and found several people between Meng Chong and Ning Zhuo.

These people were all at the Foundation Establishment stage, some well-known mechanical cultivators in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

It's worth mentioning that many of these people were on the investigation list Zhu Xuanji had previously set up.

"In general, golden core cultivators firmly occupy the top positions on the leaderboard, closely grouped, with no Foundation Establishment or Qi Refining cultivators in between." Cultivation level remains the primary factor.

"Secondly, the main force of the second tier is the members of the reformation team. The identity of trial disciples is still very useful."

"Lastly, there are some Foundation Establishment mechanical cultivators, some from the four factions of Fire Persimmon Immortal City, and some are rogue cultivators. These people are the fewest in number, mostly with old accumulations." "If the Palace Examination had appeared later, their rankings would have been squeezed out by the trial disciples." "Hmm?"

Finally, Zhu Xuanji's gaze fixed on the "Entry Standard."

His expression gradually turned unpleasant.

Elsewhere.

A burly youth was glaring with his tiger-like eyes: "What's with this leaderboard?!"

"Among all the trial disciples, I'm not the first!" Meng Chong was quite shocked.

"Ning Zhuo?"

"This guy ranks higher than me, interesting, I'll find a chance to meet him!" Ever since leaving the trial checkpoint and entering the Immortal Palace, Meng Chong had been advancing bravely, his merit rising steadily.

He personally possessed immortal potential, was powerful, and had the entire City Lord's Mansion as strong support, originally confident in his progress, but the leaderboard completely slapped him in the face.

Surprised, he quickly accepted this fact and developed a strong competitive spirit towards Ning Zhuo.

Finally.

Meng Chong saw the "Entry Standard."

"Why is there an 'Entry Standard' here too?" Meng Chong's mouth twitched, about to laugh.

But the next moment, his smile froze on his face.

He was dumbfounded, then carefully counted the list, finding that the leaderboard had thirty-three people, with thirty-two besides the "Entry Standard."

In other words, this "Entry Standard" was actually a person's name?!

"If the Palace Examination is like this, then what about the ranking list in the trial checkpoint?"

"I've been tricked!!"

Thinking of this, Meng Chong immediately threw Ning Zhuo to the back of his mind.

"Tricked!"

"Turns out, on the path to entering the Immortal Palace, I've been second all along?!" "The first is this damn 'Entry Standard'!"

"So despicable, so insidious! Are you taking me for a fool?!"

His breathing quickly became rough, his chest heaving, his breath heavy, and his eyes bloodshot.

Meng Chong had never been so humiliated since childhood.

Thinking of how he had often been complacent, satisfied with his "first" ranking, he felt a strong sense of shame and anger.

"Good one, 'Entry Standard,' I want to fight this person."

"Don't let me catch you, don't let me catch you!!" Meng Chong clenched his fists, his face flushed red like an enraged bull.

Ning Zhuo's ranking being higher than Meng Chong's quickly became unremarkable.

Zhou Zhu, Zhou Zeshen were also discussing.

"Unexpectedly, Ning Zhuo ended up being the first among our Qi Refining cultivators. This result surprises me, yet doesn't." Zhou Zeshen sighed.

Zhou Zhu nodded silently in agreement: "Anyone else being first, I wouldn't accept. But Ning Zhuo is indeed formidable, helping many people." "The Zhou family, the Zheng family, all benefited from his support, quickly gaining positions." "He is this."

Saying this, Zhou Zhu gave a thumbs up.

Due to Ning Zhuo's full efforts, his reputation among the three families' reformation teams had reached a certain pinnacle!

Zhou Zeshen's expression turned grim: "The current issue is whether this last 'Entry Standard' is the same as the one we saw on the five stone pillars in the trial room!" Zhou Zhu thought for a moment, slowly nodding, his expression and mood equally heavy.

Zhou Zeshen gritted his teeth: "I think the same as you. This means our three families, along with the City Lord's Mansion, were all tricked by this 'Entry Standard'!" "He should be Sun Lingtong." "Hmph, almost certainly!"

"The Void Sect has been deeply rooted for years, who knew they infiltrated the Lava Immortal Palace to such an extent!"

"To even change names like this, it's outright cheating, truly cunning. Too cunning!!" Zhou Zeshen stomped in anger.

Anyone discovering they were deceived so badly wouldn't feel good.

And the real "Entry Standard," Ning Zhuo, breathed a sigh of relief.

Seeing this ranking list, he too broke out in a cold sweat.

Ning Zhuo's own ranking barely made it to the last spot.

"The Buddha Heart Demon Seal represents one-third of the Lava Immortal Palace's power and will surely be heavily rewarded with merit." "But unexpectedly, after submitting it, my merit still ranked behind Zhou Zhu and the others." "It shows how big the pit was when I caused the beast tide and destroyed the Historical Records Pavilion!"

"Additionally, the passing of Ning Xiaohui and Zheng Jian was a key factor. If they were alive, I might have been squeezed out of this list." Ning Zhuo was very grateful he had eliminated some competitors in advance.

This wasn't his original intention.

It was purely a matter of fate.

"Perhaps, it's also because I planted the Life Hanging by a Thread on them early, and fate energy favored me." Fortunately, the ring's timely reminder, otherwise Ning Zhuo would have missed this only opportunity!

"Brother Zheng Jian, thank you." Ning Zhuo expressed his gratitude inwardly.

"Looking at it this way, even if I submitted the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, the name change had already happened, so the name didn't change." This was relatively good news for Ning Zhuo.

Staring at his "Ning Zhuo" name, was Sun Lingtong.

This was Ning Zhuo's previous arrangement.

"Will the public's misconception about this be advantageous for my upcoming Palace Examination?"

"Having an extra layer of concealment doesn't seem like a bad thing!"

On the other side.

Yang Chanyu stared at Sun Lingtong: "So, you are the 'Entry Standard'?" "How did you change your name?"

Sun Lingtong giggled: "That's my secret. Now you know why I'm confident in vying for the Lava Immortal Palace, right?"

Yang Chanyu shook her head: "I only know you've fooled the entire upper echelon of Fire Persimmon Immortal City. You're in trouble; they must hate you now. After this, make sure you don't get caught by them." Sun Lingtong's smile stiffened slightly.
