Chapter 89: Unfilial Son

Ning Clan cultivators entered one after another, pouring into Ning Zhuo’s small courtyard with expressionless faces.

They fanned out to the left and right, subtly placing themselves all around Ning Zhuo.

A few others were stationed along the perimeter of the residence, scanning their surroundings with vigilance.

Ning Ze and Ning Fan stood in front of Ning Zhuo.

Ning Ze concisely explained the purpose of their visit.

Ning Zhuo raised his eyebrows. “I do have a lot of spirit stones, but that’s my own business. What does it have to do with the clan?

“You came all the way here just to ask about this, Uncle?”

The youthful and tender face of the boy was full of confusion and disbelief.

Ning Fan remained silent.

Ning Ze shook his head slightly. His expression was solemn as he said, “Little Zhuo, you’re still young. It’s understandable that you don’t grasp these things. Just tell us the truth and explain where all that money came from.”

But Ning Zhuo shook his head, troubled. “Sorry, Uncle, but I can’t say tell you.”

Ning Ze and Ning Fan were momentarily stunned.

Ning Ze lowered his voice and his face grew graver. “Why can’t you tell us? At a critical moment like this, you’re still hiding things?”

Ning Zhuo shrugged. His tone was casual, yet also revealed the stubbornness characteristic of youth. “What’s the big deal? It’s my own money. I’ll spend it however I want.”

Ning Ze became agitated. “Little Zhuo, you don’t comprehend your current situation!

“Do you think you’re still the same as before?

“You’re not!

“Now, you are someone the clan is focusing on cultivating, the second most important figure in the recultivation team. Don’t you understand?

“Someone has reported you, claiming that you’re squandering money and in possession of a mysterious fortune of unknown origin.

“Just when the clan is investing in you, offering you every kind of support, this happens! Don’t you think you owe everyone an explanation?

“Little Zhuo, your view of the world is too simple.

“In the past, you were unknown and unremarkable. No one paid attention to you, so these things didn’t matter. But now that you’re at the peak of the third level, everyone is watching you. Every little flaw will be magnified, seized upon by those with ill intent, and used against you with full force to bring you down!

“Now that you’re acting so suspiciously, they’ll spread rumors about you, saying that you’re secretly being funded by another clan, that you’ve turned traitor, or that you’re a spy sent to infiltrate our family. Doesn’t the clan have to investigate this thoroughly? How else can we be at ease?”

Ning Ze spoke at length, his tone both firm and earnest.

Ning Zhuo fell silent for a long while before finally saying, “Uncle, there are indeed hidden reasons behind this. But I can assure you, I’ve done nothing wicked or immoral. The money was obtained righteously. My conscience is clear!”

Ning Ze shot him a glare and almost grabbed Ning Zhuo by the ear. “Damn it, was I wasting my time talking just now?

“Did you even hear me?

“You say your conscience is clear, but who can prove that? Who will believe it?

“Fine. If you really didn’t do anything wrong, say it clearly. Right now, you need to prove yourself to the clan!”

Ning Zhuo still said nothing.

“Are you listening to me?” Ning Ze raised his voice, his brows furrowing in frustration as his face twisted in barely restrained anger.

Ning Zhuo sighed and finally revealed a bit more. “Uncle, you are my closest relative. Please believe me, I really haven’t done anything wrong.

“But this matter is something I really can’t speak of.

“I made a contract with someone. If I speak, I’ll suffer backlash from the contract.”

Ning Ze was stunned, then his brows furrowed even tighter. “What kind of situation would lead you to sign a contract like that?

“Aiya, you kid, you’re driving me mad!”

Ning Ze pointed at Ning Zhuo, his finger trembling with urgency.

Ning Zhuo just lowered his head and stayed silent.

Ning Ze looked at him, then turned to Ning Fan beside him, forcing a smile. In a low voice, he said, “Brother Ning Fan, could you give us a moment? I’d like to speak with my nephew alone.”

Ning Fan looked conflicted. “You know I was sent here specifically to supervise...”

At this point, Ning Ze couldn’t afford to care and quickly sent a voice transmission, offering some benefits for the favor.

Ning Fan hesitated for a moment, then nodded. “You two have promising futures. I’d rather not offend you. Fine, I’ll give you half a cup of tea’s worth of time.”

Ning Ze led Ning Zhuo into the house.

“Speak. Whatever you couldn’t say before, say it now.

“It’s just the two of us here.” Ning Ze’s face was grim.

Ning Zhuo said, “Uncle, I told you the truth already. I’m not lying. I really did sign a contract and can’t say anything about it.”

Ning Ze glared, jabbing his finger at Ning Zhuo’s forehead. Through gritted teeth, he said, “Ning Zhuo, do you understand how serious this is?

“The clan values you now, extremely so. That’s why they’ve sent out a special investigation team.

“To prevent any misunderstandings, they even sent me to talk to you personally.

“This is your best chance to come clean. If you miss it, the consequences could be huge!”

Ning Ze inhaled deeply. “Fine. Even if you’re bound by a contract, it’s not the end.

“You must understand, where there’s a lock, there’s a key.

“Just tell me what kind of contract it is. With the clan’s strength, removing it might still be possible.”

Ning Zhuo shook his head. “Uncle, I think this matter is best left untouched.

“Sigh, if you insist, I’ll tell you just one thing – this involved a Golden Core stage cultivator!”

“What?” Ning Ze was shocked and subconsciously took a step backward. “You… you’re not lying to me?”

The strongest person in the Ning Clan, the old ancestor, was also at the Golden Core stage.

Ning Zhuo sighed. “Why would I lie to you, Uncle?

“That’s why it’s better to leave this matter alone. Let’s end things here.

“If the clan can’t trust me, I’ll withdraw from the recultivation team and will no longer participate in the exploration of the Lava Immortal Palace.”

Ning Ze stomped in anger. “Little Zhuo, how can you spout such nonsense?

“I had to spend a lot of money to get you into the recultivation team.

“You think you can quit just because you want to?

“Even if you quit now, the clan will definitely investigate everything about you.

“You, you... just what have you been doing?

“How did things end up like this?!

“Tell me, just who is that Golden Core cultivator. It… it’s not the black shadow demonic cultivator, is it?”

At these words, Ning Ze’s pupils contracted violently, and a chill ran down his spine. He took another step backward.

The next moment, he sent a voice transmission to Ning Zhuo, demanding sharply, “Quick, tell me! Does it have anything to do with the black shadow demonic cultivator?”

Ning Zhuo frowned. “Uncle, don’t force me. I can’t say it.”

“How could you... actually sign a contract like that. Aiya, aiya. You… you’ve doomed our whole family… our whole clan!” Ning Ze slapped his thigh in frustration.

Ning Zhuo sighed. “Uncle, I had no choice.”

Upon hearing that, Ning Ze could not help but become even more convinced that the black shadow demonic cultivator was indeed involved.

He paced back and forth with his hands behind his back, then suddenly stopped and stared intently at Ning Zhuo. “Little Zhuo, this matter is extremely serious. You can't avoid it just because you want to.

“Today, we must get to the bottom of things.

“Don't blame me. It's all because you did something wrong!”

Ning Zhuo was startled and quickly said, “Uncle, it’s not as serious as you think...”

But Ning Ze shook his head, eager to distance himself from Ning Zhuo and prove his own innocence. He strode outside and said to Ning Fan, “My nephew did indeed sign a contract. What should we do next?

“Does the clan have any means to break the contract? The key point is that this matter involves a certain Golden Core cultivator.”

Ning Fan was shocked.

He paused for a moment, then his expression darkened. “This is a major issue, but as long as the contract wasn’t personally formed by a Golden Core cultivator, we can try breaking it.

“But are you certain?

“Right now, Ning Zhuo can’t reveal any details about the contract, and we’ll have to test different things. In the process, he may receive unavoidable harm.”

Ning Ze hesitated for a moment, then nodded firmly. “This investigation was ordered from above, and the entire clan is watching. If we don’t go this far, how can we give a proper report? Do it!”

Ning Fan’s eyes flickered. “You are Ning Zhuo’s uncle and the chief officer of this investigation. It’s your call.

“However, it would be best if Ning Zhuo cooperates voluntarily. Things would go much easier then.”

Just as Ning Fan finished speaking, Ning Zhuo said, “I refuse!”

Ning Ze turned back and glared. “Unfilial son, this is not up to you.”

Ning Ze looked around and shouted in a low voice, “Still not making a move?”

Ning Fan sighed and gave a discreet hand signal.

Two sturdy men from the investigation team stepped forward, one on each side, and grabbed Ning Zhuo. With a burst of magical power, they easily subdued him.

Ning Fan took out a magic artifact and handed it to Ning Ze. “This is the Thought-Capturing Father-Son Bracelet. You wear the father bracelet, and place the son bracelet on Ning Zhuo’s wrist. You’ll then be able to extract his thoughts.

“As the saying goes, none know the son better than the father.

“Although Ning Zhuo is bound by a contract and cannot speak the truth, his thoughts are not restricted.

“As long as we forcibly extract the related thoughts from his divine sea, we can learn the truth.

“But doing so may trigger the backlash of the contract. Our investigation team will do its best to suppress it.

“Moreover, the act of forcibly capturing thoughts itself can damage the divine sea. To avoid that, it’s best if young friend Ning Zhuo cooperates willingly.”

Ning Zhuo was pinned down and could only struggle in place. “I refuse. I absolutely refuse!”

Ning Ze snorted coldly and placed the bracelets on himself and Ning Zhuo. “Little Zhuo, you’re being stubborn. As your elder, and the closest person to you in this world, how can I allow you to continue down this errant path?

“Cooperate. It’ll be less painful that way.”

Ning Zhuo refused.

Ning Ze’s face turned icy, and he activated the Father-Son Bracelet.

The pair of bracelets on their wrists emitted a bluish-white glow.

A powerful suction force entered Ning Zhuo’s divine sea. Just as it was about to rampage within, it collided with the Buddha Heart Demon Seal.

If the suction force was a fierce wind, then the treasure seal was an unmoving mountain, perfectly guarding Ning Zhuo’s divine sea.

Ning Zhuo’s eyes rolled back, his body convulsed in the chair, and two streams of blood flowed from his nostrils.

With an expressionless face, Ning Ze continued urging the Father-Son Bracelets.

Some thoughts that Ning Zhuo had prepared ahead of time offered themselves up. Just as they were about to be captured by the suction force…

Boom.

A loud sound echoed out, and the doors to the house were flung open.

Seeing the scene in the hall, junior patriarch Ning Xiaoren immediately flew into a rage and roared out, “Stop!”
