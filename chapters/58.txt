Chapter 58: Ning Zhuo vs Yuan Dasheng

Yuan Yi said, “Don’t worry, humans like me don’t need to eat that much. We don’t get hungry easily.”

Then he smiled. “We’re brothers, aren’t we? Thanks for protecting me before. In the future, those Beggar Gang guys might bully me again, so I can’t afford to let you go hungry!”

But the ape opened its mouth and spit the food it hadn’t swallowed into its palm. Then, it held its hand out to Yuan Yi.

Yuan Yi waved his hand. “No, no.”

But his throat bobbed involuntarily.

The ape insistently stepped closer, pressing its palm near Yuan Yi’s mouth and letting out a cry.

“Hehe, then I won’t be polite.” Yuan Yi’s eyes were moist. Holding the ape’s hand, he bowed his head and quickly ate the last handful of leftovers.

“Delicious, delicious!” Yuan Yi laughed. He was all skin and bones, wearing ill-fitting clothes he’d gotten off someone else. Along with his messy hair and dirty face, he looked just like a human monkey.

The ape laughed too, squeaking happily.

One man and one ape, immersed in happiness together.

…

“Uncle Dasheng, Uncle Dasheng…”

At last, Yuan Er awakened the ape.

In the instant it opened its eyes, the ape almost mistook Yuan Er for its former master – that was how much the father and son resembled each other.

As its vision cleared, the ape’s nose twitched, and its brows immediately furrowed.

It smelled something unpleasant.

Yuan Er swallowed nervously and hurriedly explained the situation.

Halfway through listening, the ape stood up and walked out of the tent.

It stood over one zhang tall, massive and muscular like a war elephant. The scars covering its body were medals of honor, proclaiming its countless victories.

“Greetings, Lord Monkey!”

The elders all saluted.

The ape didn’t even look at them. It only had eyes for the monkey corpses on the ground. After a brief silence, it suddenly raised its head and roared in fury.

The roar was deafening. The shockwave blasted several elders off their feet.

Yuan Dasheng’s eyes turned red—it was truly enraged!

Every elder broke into a cold sweat.

Yuan Er had been purposely hanging back. When he saw the elders groveling, he felt deeply satisfied.

Seeing that the time was ripe, he stepped forward. “Uncle Monkey, don’t worry. Now that such a huge disaster has occurred, we’ll find out who did this and punish them severely!”

Yuan Dasheng slowly stopped roaring, looking down at Yuan Er. The familiar face helped it gradually calm down.

It slowly reached out a finger and gently tapped Yuan Er’s chest.

Yuan Er’s heart pounded. He took a small step back and nodded quickly, “Uncle Monkey, trust me. I won’t let you down!

“But right now, the gang is in big trouble. We absolutely must perform well at the Fire Persimmon Festival.

“Right now, we’re short on hands. Uncle Monkey, you’re the only one we can rely on.”

“Please rest well in the coming days. You are our pillar!”

Yuan Dasheng didn’t respond. Slowly turned around, it went back into the tent and disappeared from view.

Yuan Er looked at the elders scattered on the ground, smiled faintly, and flicked his sleeves. “Rise.”

All the elders obeyed his commands.

Once he left, the elders started whispering via sound transmission.

“Yuan Er is just riding on that monkey’s coattails. Does he have any leadership skills at all?” one said with disdain.

“Lord Monkey didn’t kill anyone. It seems its temper has softened.”

“What, were you hoping for it to go berserk?”

“I’m just saying, maybe it’s gotten old. Don’t you think it might have weakened?” an ambitious elder mused.

Hearing this, the oldest elder sneered inwardly and turned to leave.

The others knew nothing. He had seen Yuan Dasheng fight during an exploration of the Scarlet Flame Monster Volcanic Cavern.

“That Fire Snake’s power was almost a half-step into Golden Core.

“But Yuan Dasheng ripped it apart…

“Yuan Dasheng might be old, but its battle prowess is terrifying. It definitely has an innate talent, and at least a high-grade one at that.

“The fact that it doesn’t have a cultivation technique is its only shortcoming, and also our gang’s greatest blessing.”

…

The chirping of birds echoed out.

Stirred from his sleep, Ning Zhuo opened his eyes.

The chirping came from a mechanical parrot. A 一-shaped control rod protruded from its back, controlling its chirping to awaken Ning Zhuo on time.

“It’s about time.” Ning Zhuo activated the imprint in his chest and entered the immortal palace.

He quickly assembled a puppet body and blew through the levels.

Along the way, he spotted traces left by others. After checking the surveillance mechanical component, he saw that Zhou Zhu and Zheng Jian were now cooperating.

“For now, they’re not a big threat.

“The real problem is Yuan Dasheng. Even Meng Chong isn’t as big an issue.”

Ning Zhuo continued advancing.

He could now wield over twenty spells with high proficiency. As long as his spiritual energy held out, clearing the challenges was easy.

Once he reached as far as he could, he stopped moving forward and started retreating.

He came all the way to Room 8 before stopping and waiting.

Before long, the door burst open, and a massive ape puppet walked in.

“It’s here,” Ning Zhuo thought to himself, slowly rising to face the ape.

When their eyes met, Yuan Dasheng immediately realized that the puppet in front of it wasn’t ordinary.

It examined the puppet Ning Zhuo, then scanned the rest of the room, considering whether there would be hidden traps aside from the visible ones.

“Looks like it’s mistaken me for a gatekeeper puppet, like those kung fu puppets in earlier rooms.” Ning Zhuo nodded inwardly.

This was exactly the impression he wanted to give.

His alias on the ranking list had done its job, making Yuan Dasheng believe that it was the only one in the immortal palace.

After a moment of observation, Yuan Dasheng began moving forward.

Ning Zhuo struck immediately.

Spell – Icy Embrace Art.

Mechanical component — Wandering Flight Hand.

Spell — One Gust of Air.

Mechanical component — Air Ejection Ring.

A mechanical arm shot toward Yuan Dasheng, cold air seeping out from its palm.

Normally, the chill would only harm on contact. But with the spinning Air Ejection Ring and One Gust of Air blowing the freezing aura outward, a fan-shaped wave of chilly air swept out across the room.

Yuan Dasheng quickly dodged. Although it avoided most of the cold air, frost still covered part of its left leg.

Yuan Dasheng’s eyes lit up with savagery!

A gatekeeper puppet that could cast spells—this was a first.

Without hesitation, Yuan Dasheng charged forward, rushing at Ning Zhuo with overwhelming ferocity.

Ning Zhuo leapt lightly and activated the One Gust of Air spell. Combined with the Air Ejection Rings on both his ankles, air burst out and propelled him backward.

This quickly widened the distance.

And as he retreated, Ning Zhuo also attacked simultaneously.

Over a dozen Wandering Flight Hands launched continuous attacks, casting spells like the Icy Embrace Art, Fiery Grasp Art, Metal Plucking Art, Wood Grafting Art, and more. All these spells turned into mid- to long-range attacks thanks to the power of One Gust of Air.

Yuan Dasheng minimized its body’s surface area, using both arms to guard its face as it smashed through all the spells and charged at Ning Zhuo’s body at all costs.

Tactically speaking, this choice was absolutely correct!

But it couldn’t save Yuan Dasheng from being defeated.

Moments later, Yuan Dasheng’s puppet body collapsed. Some parts were scorched, others frozen into ice blocks, some sprouting tangling trees and creating grand obstacles…

Just before shattering, Yuan Dasheng raised its head and roared. The sound was filled with reluctance, rage, and helplessness.

Stifling, unbearably stifling.

This wasn’t its true strength at all!

…

“I stopped it.” Ning Zhuo exhaled in relief.

The mechanical traps he had set were almost useless against Yuan Dasheng. Only by personally taking action could he bring the ape’s advance to a halt.
