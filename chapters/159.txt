Chapter 159: Branch Support

Ning Zhuo took the lead, pushing open the courtyard gate first.

Behind him were over twenty fellow students, with Ning Chen and Ning Yong following closely.

Wang Lan was the last to step out, closing the gate behind her. 

In fact, before they even left the courtyard together, numerous communication talismans had already flown out.

This was because Ning Zhuo had requested everyone to spread the news as widely as possible before heading to the clan's ancestral hall, believing it would be beneficial for everyone to know.

These talismans quickly dispersed in the air, like countless small stones falling into the large pond of the Ning family estate.

The impact began to spread.

"Young Clan Leader Ning Xiaoren wants to make Ning Zhuo his dog, so he framed Ning Zhuo's uncle?" "The Young Clan Leader imprisoned Ning Ze and used his life and freedom as leverage?" "This news must be fake!"

"Ridiculous, who spread this rumor?" "Hmph, hasn't Ning Xiaoren done enough outrageous things already?" "Even so, if he really did this, it's too much!"

Even members of the main branch, upon hearing this news, felt that Ning Xiaoren had gone too far, completely crossing the line!

According to the rumors, Ning Zhuo's father, Ning Zhong, was Ning Xiaoren's savior.

Ning Xiaoren had promised to support Ning Zhuo before Ning Zhong died in battle.

However, in the years that followed, Ning Xiaoren did not provide any resources to Ning Zhuo, breaking his promise.

Ning Zhuo displayed exceptional talent and potential, catching Ning Xiaoren's eye.

To make up for his previous neglect, Ning Xiaoren schemed to frame Ning Zhuo's uncle, falsely accusing him of embezzling resources meant for Ning Zhuo, causing a rift within Ning Zhuo's family.

Ning Zhuo achieved significant success in exploring the Immortal Palace, but Ning Xiaoren's rewards were unjust.

Angered, Ning Zhuo quit the reformation team, prompting Ning Xiaoren to threaten Ning Ze's life and freedom, forcing Wang Lan to kneel publicly, coercing Ning Zhuo into submission.

Is this something a Young Clan Leader should do? Is this something a righteous cultivator would do? If true, Ning Xiaoren, as the Young Clan Leader of the Ning family, using such methods against his own clan members, is absolutely unworthy of his position.

"If Ning Xiaoren really did this, it's utterly outrageous!" "He wouldn't be that foolish, would he?" "I think it's more likely Ning Zhuo's slander."

The name Ning Zhuo had become well-known among the Ning family members recently.

Ning Zhuo, once an insignificant figure from a branch family, had risen to prominence in the joint test of the three families. 

If his exceptional compatibility with the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique made people envious of his luck, then his display of talent made most people optimistic about his future.

After Ning Zhuo helped his classmates, more and more people developed a favorable impression of him.

Recently, Ning Zhuo's exploration of the Immortal Palace, reaching the eighth level, made him a sensation! Such achievements completely overshadowed Ning Xiaohui.

The key point was that Ning Zhuo came from a branch family, while Ning Xiaohui was from the main branch.

This made the branch family members, who had long been oppressed, secretly rejoice.

Their joy was short-lived, as they soon heard of Ning Zhuo's unfair treatment and his voluntary departure from the reformation team.

Despite Ning Xiaoren's attempts to twist public opinion, the branch family members continued to discuss the "unfair treatment."

Many branch family members sympathized with Ning Zhuo's actions and admired his courage.

However, some secretly resented him. "When I faced oppression from the main branch, I retreated and conceded. But you, Ning Zhuo, stood firm and resisted publicly. Compared to you, what does that make me?"

Human nature is subtle.

Ning Zhuo's situation had been a hot topic within the clan.

Now, with the explosive news about Ning Xiaoren and Ning Ze, public opinion was like a splash of oil on a burning fire.

With a roar, the flames exploded, burning fiercely!

One person told ten, ten told a hundred, a hundred told a thousand...

"If the Young Clan Leader really did this, his character is truly deplorable." "Is it really true?" "Ning Zhuo and his group are heading to the ancestral hall. Let's go see for ourselves!" "Let's go, I'm from a branch family too, and I've suffered oppression from the main branch. I want to support Ning Zhuo!"

Many clan members set off, heading towards the Ning family's ancestral hall.

From a bird's-eye view, one could see clan members emerging from their residences, converging on the streets and paths, forming streams of people heading towards the ancestral hall.

"What's going on?" The elder guarding the ancestral hall sensed something amiss.

Before Ning Zhuo's group arrived, other clan members had already gathered at the hall.

"How dare you! Gathering here without reason, disturbing the ancestors' peace, what are you trying to do?" The ancestral hall elder stepped forward, scolding the gathered clan members.

Some showed signs of fear.

A branch family steward stepped out, saluted the elder, and said, "Elder, something major has happened. We must get to the bottom of it today. Otherwise, if someone is wronged, the ancestors will be furious and criticize us for being unfilial."

The elder frowned.

He invoked the ancestors, but the steward did the same.

The elder's expression turned displeased. "Ning Xiangguo, what exactly happened?"

Ning Xiangguo, speaking out of righteousness, briefly explained the situation.

The elder's face changed slightly.

As a core member of the main branch, he was well aware of Ning Xiaoren's ways.

"Given the Young Clan Leader's nature, he might actually do such a thing." "Is there still time to remedy this?"

Thinking this, the elder nodded slightly, his expression softening. "As the elder of the ancestral hall, I have always acted impartially. Since this matter has escalated, let the Clan Leader and the other elders witness it. You all have the right to supervise, but gathering at the entrance is inappropriate. Disperse and let my subordinates open the three gates and prepare the hall for you to enter."

"You, go notify the Clan Leader and the elders!" The elder openly instructed a subordinate to inform the others.

As he spoke, more clan members arrived at the hall.

The elder was secretly astonished. "This is definitely a major event that has alarmed the entire clan. It's hard to imagine that it was stirred up by a Qi Refining Stage youth."

The elder knew he could only go with the flow.

Covering it up was impossible, and even a slight delay might earn the clan members' scorn.

As a member of the main branch, he could only hope that Ning Xiaoren was falsely accused and had not done these things.

The Clan Leader quickly learned of the situation and stood up in shock.

As a father, he knew Ning Xiaoren's ways too well.

He immediately cast a spell, sending a talisman to notify Ning Xiaoren.

Ning Xiaoren, in seclusion to replenish his qi, was annoyed by the interruption.

However, recognizing his father's talisman, he became curious. "What does Father want? It seems urgent..." "Ah!" Seeing the talisman's content, Ning Xiaoren jumped up as if his seat was on fire.

"Ning Zhuo, that little brat, wants to ruin me!" Ning Xiaoren had no mind to continue cultivating.

He pushed open the secret room door and rushed out, heading straight for the private prison.

In this critical moment, Ning Ze was the key figure.

If Ning Ze compromised and denied everything, Ning Xiaoren still had hope.

However, upon reaching the private prison, he saw a group of branch family members surrounding it. "Move aside!" Ning Xiaoren shouted, "Gathering here, are you trying to cause trouble?" The branch family members, seeing the Young Clan Leader, were momentarily flustered.

At this moment, an elderly voice spoke, "Young Clan Leader, you're a step too late. I've already brought Ning Zhuo's uncle out." Ning Xiaoren's heart sank as he saw the crowd part, revealing an elder slowly walking out, with a bewildered Ning Ze behind him.

Seeing the elder, Ning Xiaoren's vision darkened.

He bowed and greeted, "Elder Fu." The elder, Ning Youfu, was a respected figure from the branch family, having once served as the elder of the Talisman Hall.

Ning Xiaoren tried to explain, "Elder Fu, you may not know, this is all Ning Zhuo's scheme. Ning Ze is suspected of multiple counts of embezzlement and is under investigation. Ning Ze's wife, Wang Lan, has repeatedly asked me to release Ning Ze, but I refused as the investigation is ongoing."

Ning Youfu smiled at Ning Xiaoren, "I've personally taken Ning Ze away, Young Clan Leader. If you want to stop me, you'll have to step over my dead body."

Ning Xiaoren quickly said, "Of course not, Elder Fu, you misunderstand me." "Misunderstanding or not, the ancestral hall will reveal the truth. Young Clan Leader, please." With that, Ning Youfu led Ning Ze out of the crowd, approaching Ning Xiaoren.

Ning Xiaoren gritted his teeth, wanting to persist, but under the watchful eyes of the crowd and facing the highly respected Ning Youfu, he had no choice but to step aside.

Ning Youfu laughed heartily and continued walking.

As he passed Ning Xiaoren, Ning Xiaoren's expression changed, glaring at Ning Ze as if warning him not to say anything inappropriate.

Ning Ze quickly lowered his head, avoiding Ning Xiaoren's gaze, filled with confusion.

Ning Youfu hadn't explained much to him. "So, what exactly is happening?!"

Ning Zhuo and his group marched through the clan estate.

Compared to when they left their residence, Ning Zhuo's team had more than doubled, with at least fifty more people.

As they continued, more people joined their ranks.

People chattered, asking Ning Zhuo many questions, full of curiosity.

Ning Zhuo, with an angry expression, kept responding.

Ning Yong, dissatisfied, whispered to Ning Zhuo, "Brother Zhuo, stopping to explain to everyone is delaying our progress."

Ning Zhuo glanced at Ning Yong without explaining.

Ning Chen transmitted his voice, "Fool! In this situation, the more people know and support us, the better our chances of success. Do you understand?" Ning Yong nodded repeatedly, "Got it, got it."
