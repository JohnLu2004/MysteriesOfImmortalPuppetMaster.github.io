Chapter 404: Receiving the Ten Thousand Year Water Crystal

While the Fairy Queen Jingyu was speaking, she was also controlling the The Mirror Wall's Mechanisms.

Everyone's vision quickly expanded, approaching the legendary demon pear tree. They saw numerous spiritual bodies outside the demon's nest, constantly battling with demon beasts.

Various demon beasts of strange shapes emerged endlessly from the demon pear tree, trying to break through the seal and return to wreak havoc in the human world. They were all blocked by countless spiritual bodies of the ancestors.

"It's Senior Brother!" Lin Shanshan cried out.

Everyone also saw Linghu Jiu.

At this time, Linghu Jiu could only fight at the outermost edges, using all his strength to entangle with the small demon beasts that were deliberately left behind from the front lines.

Although he was only at the Foundation Establishment level, he had the fighting power of a Golden Core cultivator.

In front of the legendary demon pear tree, he could only be considered a minor figure, only able to deal with the weakest class of demon beasts.

Wood, water, and wind spells were used in rotation by his hands, yet the situation remained quite dangerous.

Only by using the Lonely Sword Scripture could he turn the tide.

After watching the battle for a while, Ning Zhuo also noticed Linghu Jiu's fatigue.

"Senior Brother Linghu's Lonely Sword Scripture cannot be used frequently or continuously.

Previously, when he sparred with Linghu Jiu's projection, the latter also only used the Lonely Sword Scripture at the last moment, using it together as a final burst.

"Looking at it this way, the Lonely Sword Scripture and the Bitter Cold Scripture have similar principles. Both need to draw upon certain genuine emotions from the sea of consciousness to possess unique power.

Those who practice the Bitter Cold Scripture, like Hanzhou, are like this. They must suffer and seek out suffering, making themselves cold and hungry, barely clothed, to continuously generate bitterness in the upper dantian of their sea of consciousness. Under the enhancement of this bitterness, the various techniques of the Bitter Cold Scripture can have extraordinary power, and the suffering body grows stronger with practice.

"Senior Brother Linghu's Lonely Sword Scripture, since it's named 'Lonely,' and all its sword techniques are filled with lonely and solitary meanings, probably works the same way."

Linghu Jiu had clearly been fighting for a long time and was exhausted. Finally, he caught a weakness in his opponent and executed the Lonely Sword technique, beheading the demon beast.

Everyone who witnessed the latter half of Linghu Jiu's bitter battle remained silent.

Linghu Jiu's fighting power was impressive enough, but here, he was just a minor player.

The person truly moved was Ning Jiufan.

This Golden Core ancestor of the Ning family felt bitter in his heart, realizing that if he were in Linghu Jiu's position, he would probably struggle just as much.

"Those of us at the Golden Core level are as weak as ants in front of the legendary demon's nest. Our Golden Cores and bodies wouldn't even be enough to fill the teeth of these fierce demon beasts."

Ning Zhuo suddenly thought of something and, feeling moved, bowed to Fairy Queen Jingyu and said gratefully:

"Since the Martial Emperor's era, Fairy Queen and the other ancestral seniors have guarded this place, resisting demons and protecting the world for endless years. Today, our human race can dominate the world thanks to the great achievements of these ancestors!"

"However, the Linglong Mirror Wall is hidden in underground caves, covered by layers of historical mist, unseen by the sun. The glorious achievements of the great ancestors are unknown to most people. Only now do I understand that today's happiness and peace come from the quiet dedication of these great ancestors in the shadows."

"The first formation I entered was called the Jade Water Drop Formation. As it is said, 'Before the golden gates open, the jade water clock still drips; under the canopy, one descends from the chariot to rest with heaven.' The legendary demon's nest cannot be completely eliminated, only suppressed and sealed. This night has continued unbroken since the Blood Remnant Dynasty, never resting. Only the ancestral seniors guard this night, preventing darkness from returning to the world and disasters from spreading. The ancestral seniors' merits will shine forever!"

Ning Zhuo spoke what was in everyone's hearts, and the others all showed solemn expressions in agreement.

How many years had passed since the suppression of the legendary demon pear tree began in the Martial Emperor's era and continued until today?

These spiritual bodies in the Linglong Mirror Wall had never slackened, firmly containing the demon beast plague without letting it spread. This was a great service to all races in today's world!

The jade water clock still drips, the night hasn't passed, but it is because these people have been constantly fighting for tens of thousands of years that the world remains bright.

Fairy Queen Jingyu looked at the bowing Ning Zhuo and smiled slightly: "Young friend Ning Zhuo, please rise. The river's waves flow endlessly, and gaining your recognition means we ancestors can give an account of ourselves to future generations."

A spiritual body suddenly appeared: "Haha, I heard what was just said. With such recognition, I feel that guarding this place, even for endless years, has been worth it!"

The laughing person wore a gray robe, had a pale face, ape-like fangs, and blue eyes - he was actually a zombie. Though his appearance was frightening, his bearing was magnificent, and his gaze was clear and steady.

Sun Lingtong exclaimed: "Isn't this Lord Sima Zhong?"

Ning Zhuo immediately showed respectful reverence and bowed to the newcomer.

Sima Zhong was a historically renowned scholar in this world. In his time, he was a court historian recording the rulers' words and actions. Because he maintained justice and recorded truthfully, he suffered persecution from the ruler and was imprisoned, losing his freedom.

To preserve historical truth, Sima Zhong didn't hesitate to destroy himself, cultivating from a living person into a zombie to gain longevity. Throughout his life, his pen remained sharp, maintaining justice, exploring historical sites, restoring original truths, earning the respect of countless generations.

Unexpectedly, the Sima family had also left an image in the Linglong Mirror Wall.

Sima Zhong, with his blue eyes and fangs, looked Ning Zhuo up and down, having a good first impression of this big-headed youth: "What fine jade and talent. Each generation produces its talents, and seeing excellent younger generations like you makes me happy."

He glanced at Ning Zhuo's waist, then looked at Zhu Xuanji, and laughed again: "Good, good, good."

"Before you three, along with Linghu Jiu, leave this place, each will receive a Ten Thousand Year Water Crystal."

Ning Zhuo thanked him again.

Zhu Xuanji also bowed in gratitude.

The Ten Thousand Year Water Crystal was a Nascent Soul level cultivation resource. Even Zhu Xuanji, a member of the royal family, was delighted to receive such a treasure.

Sun Lingtong, poking his head out from the Ten Thousand Li Flying Dragon, giggled and thought: "Giving gifts upon meeting, truly a good senior!"

He was very familiar with Sima Zhong because when his master was alive, he had been told to study Sima Zhong's works thoroughly.

Sima Zhong had deep experience in exploring ancient tombs and excavating historical artifacts.

When Sun Lingtong traveled with his master, they often used knowledge from Sima Zhong's works to increase their wealth.

The Five Elements Divine Lord also materialized at this time: "Besides the Ten Thousand Year Water Crystal, if you want other materials, you'll have to get them yourselves."

"These endless demon beasts are each a treasure trove."

"You can rely on your own abilities to slay demons and obtain treasures!"

"Or, you can leave your spiritual bodies here, letting them eliminate demons. We'll keep the spoils of war for you, and during your lifetime, when you return here, you can collect eighty percent of them."

Ning Zhuo laughed: "Five Elements Divine Lord Senior, seeing how Lord Sima Zhong is, couldn't you give me something too?"

The Five Elements Divine Lord glared: "Brat, I've already passed on my Five Victory Temple Spirit Technique to you, no, you stole it."

"You've also stolen and studied my Five Elements realm for a long time, learning countless things."

"You still want my spoils of war?"

"Your face is too thick!"

Hearing these words, Sima Zhong immediately turned his curious gaze to Ning Zhuo: "So this is Five Elements Divine Lord's successor across generations? Congratulations to you, senior."

The Five Elements Divine Lord quickly waved his hands: "No, he's not my disciple, he just stole everything, stole it all!"

Fairy Queen Jingyu smiled gently: "In the past, the Divine Lord nurtured five spirits within his body, monopolizing the principles of the five elements of heaven and earth, becoming the Five Elements Divine Being. Replacing heaven with human will invited heaven's anger, and his fortune declined extremely, bringing misfortune in his later years."

The Five Elements Divine Lord cursed with a laugh: "Damn it, actually my original body hadn't even reached old age before being sacrificed."

Ning Zhuo immediately understood that Fairy Queen Jingyu was using the Five Elements Divine Lord as an example to warn him not to imitate the Divine Lord's past actions of nurturing the five organ spirits to monopolize the positions of heaven's gods, which would invite heaven's anger.

Ning Zhuo quickly bowed, indicating that he had learned the lesson and would definitely keep this warning in mind!

Fairy Queen Jingyu slowly nodded and spoke again: "The Linglong Mirror Wall was initially just a spirit treasure. After countless years, it has now reached the level of a quasi-immortal treasure."

"This is all because the spiritual bodies eliminated these demon beasts, refined their demon materials, and merged them into the wall, continuously deepening the foundation of this spirit treasure. Over time, they used the most profound foundation to forcefully push its grade upward."

"We are all spiritual bodies, constrained by the spirit treasure itself. So we can only follow the quota system for distributing the spoils from demon slaying."

"As for our inheritance, and the Ten Thousand Year Water Crystals in the cave outside the wall, these are items outside the rules, so we can give them according to our own will."

At this point, the Fairy Queen paused, turning her gaze to Zhu Xuanji: "I know your identities and backgrounds. Among the spiritual bodies in the wall, many are skilled in divination."

"The world has been peaceful for long, but in several hundred years, there will be a catastrophe, ushering in an era of great contention."

"This great era will at least be an Imperial Dynasty, and might even possibly be the fourth Emperor Dynasty in history!"

"An Imperial Dynasty is one thing, but whenever an Emperor Dynasty comes, the Linglong Mirror Wall will seal itself and sink into the depths of the earth, avoiding the world..."

"Before this happens, the Linglong Mirror Wall must use these mere hundreds of years to actively absorb the projections of talented future generations to counter the legendary demon nest's counterattack."

The legendary demon pear tree came from beyond the heavens, immortal and indestructible, with endless demon beasts evolving along with the external environment.

Therefore, unchanging formations cannot contain the demon nest, because the demon beasts might evolve life forms that can adapt to the formations and drill through their holes.

The Linglong Mirror Wall using humans to control the pear tree was both an innovation and a desperate measure.

Similarly, the legendary demon nest was still constantly evolving and adapting to face these spiritual bodies.

Though powerful figures like the Five Elements Divine Lord's techniques were still effective, their impact was far less than before.

Therefore, the Linglong Mirror Wall needed to continuously absorb strong future generations, create their spiritual bodies, to maintain suppression over the legendary demon nest.

This was why Fairy Queen Jingyu and others valued excellent descendants like Ning Zhuo and Linghu Jiu.

Ning Zhuo felt confused and asked: "Junior doesn't understand, throughout the dynasties there have been many wise and capable people, wouldn't they better help the Linglong Mirror Wall suppress the legendary demon nest?"

"Why does the Mirror Wall have to avoid the world whenever an Emperor Dynasty comes?"
