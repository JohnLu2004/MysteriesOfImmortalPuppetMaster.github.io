Chapter 612: Not Truly Dual Cultivation!

White Paper Immortal City.

Qing Chi and Jiao Ma (Ning Zhuo) stepped into the secluded chamber together.

“Do you think they can succeed?” Jiao Ma’s father asked, his face full of worry.

Standing beside him were Qing Yan, Li Xiangshang, and Wen Ruanyu.

Li Xiangshang let out a sigh. “Refining military spirit into a cultivation seed is no easy feat. Jiao Ma and Qing Chi are both very young - how much experience do they even have in refining tools?”

Jiao Ma’s father gave a slight shake of the head, his expression growing even more anxious.

Qing Yan said, “Even if the chances are slim, what other choice do we have? We’ve come this far - there’s no turning back.”

But Wen Ruanyu chuckled. “I actually think the two of them can pull it off.”

All three turned to him, waiting for an explanation.

Wen Ruanyu simply smiled again, offering no further comment, playing the part of the inscrutable sage.

Ning Zhuo scanned the chamber.

This was the private cultivation room personally lent out by the City Lord - usually reserved for her own use. With a time-acceleration formation inscribed inside, the setup was naturally of the highest quality.

After he and Qing Chi had finished looking around, Ning Zhuo began channeling his divine sense to inspect every component of the room, especially the time-acceleration array.

Qing Chi, meanwhile, was staring at Ning Zhuo, her heart filled with bliss. Being alone in the same room with Little Ma, refining a military seed together... it’s just too wonderful!

With him by my side, I’m sure I’ll succeed this time!

Once the military seed is refined, even if White Paper Immortal City is swallowed up by the ghost tide in the future, Little Ma and I can escape together.

Her resolve was absolute, her heart filled with anticipation for the future.

Ning Zhuo conducted several thorough inspections and found nothing amiss, then asked Qing Chi to check as well.

But she didn’t know how to read the formations - she had to consult the relevant jade slips and have Ning Zhuo explain the basics before she could understand how to operate the array.

After a short rest, the two sat down cross-legged and formally began their refinement process.

At a thought from Ning Zhuo, the array activated.

Space trembled, and translucent ripples shimmered through the air. Before their eyes, a mound of green sandalwood appeared, piled like a small hill.

The century-old wood gleamed with a bronze sheen, exuding an ancient and weighty aura. From its cross-sections, amber-colored resin slowly seeped outward.

“Let’s begin,” Ning Zhuo said, turning to Qing Chi.

Qing Chi gave a resolute nod. With focused expression, she released her divine sense and channeled her spiritual energy, beginning to process the aged sandalwood.

As the bearer of the military spirit, Qing Chi had to lead the entire refinement process.

Even with the reduced standard - thanks to Li Xiangshang’s low-tier talent cutting the requirement by about thirty percent - the volume of sandalwood was still immense for her alone.

If she were refining it solo under normal conditions, it might take two or three years to finish.

But here, in this sealed cultivation chamber, she could rely on the array’s support - and Ning Zhuo’s assistance - to save ninety-nine percent of the effort.

And with the time-acceleration array, the process would be vastly shortened.

Whoosh!

Suddenly, clusters of blue-green flame rose from the array, blooming into a roaring blaze.

The chamber filled with flickering azure fire.

The intensity of the flames startled Qing Chi.

“What a huge fire,” she said, instinctively moving to process the green sandalwood.

But Ning Zhuo stopped her. “Hold on. Turn the flame down a bit.”

“Okay,” she replied, immediately obeying.

The blaze quickly subsided, reduced to less than half its original strength.

Then Ning Zhuo sent a message through divine sense. “Adjust it more slowly. Raise it just a little.”

His mastery over fire was far more advanced, and his foundation in artifact refinement was solid. Compared to Qing Chi, he could control the process with greater finesse.

Once the blue-green flames reached an ideal intensity, Ning Zhuo got to work, feeding the green sandalwood piece by piece into the fire.

His role was to assist; Qing Chi would lead the refinement.

The ghostman girl’s spiritual power steadily declined, and beads of sweat soon appeared on the tip of her nose.

She focused all her attention on controlling the array.

In the roaring blaze, the green sandalwood began to melt like bronze, transforming into thick pools of dark wood pulp.

When the last of the wood had dissolved, Ning Zhuo immediately retrieved a stash of Chenzhou cinnabar.

Sprinkling it into the wood pulp, countless violet flecks bloomed within the deep-ink mixture.

Qing Chi was panting, her divine sense nearly depleted.

“Save your strength,” Ning Zhuo told her. “I’ll take over.”

He stepped in - and was quickly taken aback.

The burden of the refinement was heavier than he’d expected.

Fortunately, Ning Zhuo’s soul was vast, forged to the power of million man soul. His divine sea housed one of the Three Sects Supreme Arts, the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique, making his divine sense far stronger than others at his level.

Moments later, he had completed this critical step.

The hundred thousand jin of wood pulp condensed into a mass of translucent green jade marrow. It swirled into concentric rings like the growth rings of a tree. Scattered throughout were countless violet-black points of light, like stars strewn across a galaxy.

Qing Chi, given a brief chance to recover, had already regained most of her strength.

She looked at Ning Zhuo with gratitude, sending a message via divine sense: “Little Ma, if it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t have made it through the first step.”

Ning Zhuo glanced at her, reevaluating her in his mind. Her skill in refinement was clearly stronger than he’d thought.

“Let’s keep going. You’re the one bearing the military spirit. The final steps have to be done by you.”

“Mm!” Qing Chi nodded firmly, then bit the tip of her tongue and spat out a mouthful of her lifeblood.

The blood landed in the jade marrow and instantly turned into a stream of red light, seeping into it.

Within a few breaths, the entire jade marrow was glowing blood-red.

But just as the light began to fade, Qing Chi still hadn’t made the next move.

Ning Zhuo called out sharply, “Qing Chi!”

Gritting her teeth, she replied with difficulty, “Little Ma... I can’t activate it...”

Without hesitation, Ning Zhuo stepped in, flooding the formation plate with divine sense. He activated the sigil-imprinting array embedded within it.

In an instant, ten thousand glowing talisman imprints descended into the blood-red jade marrow.

The jade marrow shattered, transforming into strips of green-violet spirit currency.

Ning Zhuo repeated the process again and again, imprinting more sigils until he had created one hundred thousand pieces of green-violet currency.

Only a small portion of jade marrow remained.

“This time, let me try.” Qing Chi’s tone was full of defiance.

Ning Zhuo stepped aside, letting her take the lead.

It was tough going, but Qing Chi managed to refine over three thousand more of the green-violet coins.

“It’s too hard... It’s really too hard to forge even one military spirit,” she muttered, her confidence badly shaken. “I gave it everything I had, and I still couldn’t manage even a single imprint.”

She looked over at him. “Little Ma, how is your divine sense so strong?”

Ning Zhuo shook his head. “Now’s not the time to get into that.”

His expression grew solemn. “At this rate, we’re likely going to fail.”

Qing Chi nodded. “I could rely on you for the earlier steps, but the next part - offering incense - I have to do from within my divine sea. You can’t help me there.”

“Damn it!”

She clenched her teeth, furious and unwilling to accept failure looming so close.

Ning Zhuo stared at her and sent a message through divine sense. “There’s still one way. But for it to work, you’ll need to completely open yourself to me - no resistance. Whether it’s controlling your physical body or entering your divine sea and dantian, you’ll need to fully cooperate.”

Qing Chi froze at his words. Then, to his surprise, she gave him a shy yet sweet smile. “Little Ma, you can do whatever you want to me. Go ahead!”

Ning Zhuo: ......

A swirl of emotions rose in him.

Qing Chi urged him on. “What are you waiting for? Hurry up.”

He let out a quiet sigh, steadied himself, and activated his trump card.

Divine ability - Life Hanging by a Thread.

With his current strength, Ning Zhuo could use this ability even on peak Golden Core cultivators. And Qing Chi, still in Foundation Establishment, had no way to resist.

Not that she tried. Her trust in Little Ma ran deep - perhaps as deep as Sun Lingtong’s trust in Ning Zhuo himself.

The connection formed instantly, unhindered.

Ning Zhuo split his focus in three directions.

One part of his mind manipulated Qing Chi’s body via the Life Hanging by a Thread.

Another sent his divine sense flooding into her divine sea.

The third controlled the formation, continuing the artifact refinement process.

The incense of the Southern Sea lit, its smoke rising in thick, purple coils like writhing dragons.

The smoke-dragons entered Qing Chi’s divine sea, surging in like crashing waves of violet mist.

The heart-shaped military spirit rose into her divine sea, endlessly absorbing the purple smoke.

Once it had taken in enough, the military spirit suddenly exploded, shattering into countless blue points of light that scattered into the vast, stormy violet mist.

At that moment, both Ning Zhuo and Qing Chi could hear the clash of battle - the ring of armor, the crash of weapons, the roar of voices, the beat of war drums.

Blood ran from Ning Zhuo’s nostrils. In that instant, he’d given everything he had.

Qing Chi poured in her strength too, though her help was minimal.

They both heard the battle cries fade, the sounds of war growing more and more distant. In the violet smoke, the blue lights were drifting apart, growing more scattered.

They must not be allowed to drift too far.

If they did, the blue lights would be completely severed, no longer part of the military spirit’s core.

At the critical moment, Ning Zhuo immediately activated the formation, burning the freshly refined green-violet coins.

As the paper coins turned to ash, the smoke they produced flowed into Qing Chi’s divine sea.

Within that smoke, the scattered blue light particles stirred as if summoned. One by one, they gathered again and reformed into a complete military spirit.

But this time, the spirit was markedly different - more condensed, and at least fifty percent larger than before.

It continued to absorb the violet smoke in the shape of flood dragons, until once again, the military spirit burst apart. The countless blue points bathed in the violet mist, undergoing further transformation.

Ning Zhuo waited a moment, then burned another batch of green-violet coins, forging the military spirit anew.

This time, it emerged vibrant with blue light, vividly lifelike.

So the cycle continued.

After burning a full hundred thousand green-violet coins, the military spirit had undergone a complete transformation.

Now the heart-like object was the size of a carriage, solid as coral crystal, half-transparent, with green-violet veins pulsing from core to surface.

Thump. Thump. Thump...

Each beat sent out a ripple of force, saturated with the murderous energy of a battlefield formation.

The once chaotic sounds of war - clashing steel, battle cries, the thunder of drums - had all faded into silence.

At this point, the military spirit had nearly completed its transformation into a military seed.

Ning Zhuo gazed at it and willed it forward.

In the next instant, the military seed was forcibly drawn out, lifting away from Qing Chi’s divine sea.

But as soon as it entered Ning Zhuo’s divine sea, a powerful force pulled back. The seed was yanked away and flung back into Qing Chi’s dantian.

Ning Zhuo sighed inwardly. “I took a major role in forging this seed, and I’ve established some control over it. But in the end, it still leans toward Qing Chi.”

“If more members of the Jiao Clan joined the army and pledged themselves fully to me, perhaps one day my control could surpass hers.”

“But this military seed isn’t suited for my divine sea. The one it truly matches is Qing Chi’s.”

Qing Chi’s core cultivation focused on tempering the middle dantian and qi sea. Throughout this forging process, her divine sea had been deeply transformed by the green-violet smoke, now creating an environment compatible with the military seed.

Ning Zhuo’s divine sea was already tied to his primary cultivation path and was completely unsuited to housing a military seed. Forcing it would not only harm him, but severely reduce the chance of success.

Putting those thoughts aside, Ning Zhuo softly called her name. “Wake up.”

Qing Chi had lost consciousness midway through, unable to endure the strain.

Fortunately, the chamber’s formation was thorough. A healing array had already activated, protecting her body and soul.

When she stirred and saw the military seed within her divine sea, her eyes lit up. “Little Ma, you did it!”

Ning Zhuo gave a quiet reminder. “Not yet. There’s still one last step.”

The stone tiles in the center of the chamber slid open, revealing a massive underground well.

From deep within it surged a tremendous yin aura, rushing out like a roaring river.

After a brief period of rest, Qing Chi had regained her strength and was back at her peak.

Carrying the nascent military seed within her divine sea, she leapt into the well.

Inside, the yin energy spiraled into a vortex, wrapping her at the center. The immense yin force engulfed her from head to toe.

The sheer volume of it poured directly into her divine sea, and the military seed absorbed it madly.

In moments, Qing Chi was shivering violently from the cold, but her willpower surpassed all norms. Gritting her teeth, the ghostman girl endured without a single word.

Ning Zhuo kept his eyes on her, while doing everything he could to recover.

His condition was poor, and every second counted. Even a sliver of strength regained was worth it.

Things quickly took a turn for the worse.

As the vessel for the military seed, every trace of yin energy the seed absorbed washed through Qing Chi’s body in turn.

Being of the ghostrace, the girl naturally possessed an abundance of yin qi, and her physique was far more attuned to it than a human’s.

But the problem was, she was only at the Foundation Establishment stage - and the yin energy here was simply too immense, too overwhelming.

Before long, her face turned bluish-green, her teeth sharpened into fangs, claws sprouted from her fingers, and her hair grew wild and long. Her human features rapidly faded, while ghostly traits asserted themselves more and more strongly.

Ning Zhuo narrowed his eyes, struck by a troubling thought. “If this continues unchecked... will she completely turn into a ghost creature?”

That was absolutely unacceptable.

Without hesitation, Ning Zhuo struck. He expelled a surge of pure yang energy.

The yang qi flowed along the thread of life connecting them, precisely entering Qing Chi’s body.

At once, she felt a warm current flood through her limbs and bones, spreading swiftly throughout. Her mind cleared, and her ghostly traits rapidly receded until her original appearance was restored.

“Little Ma, you - are we... are we dual cultivating?!” Qing Chi was flustered, but her delight was plain.

“Don’t get distracted,” Ning Zhuo said coolly. “Focus on refining the military seed.”

“Right, right! Got it!” Qing Chi beamed, nodding eagerly.

The icy, bone-piercing yin energy that had just been tormenting her now seemed utterly adorable.

“If it weren’t for all this yin qi pressing down on me, how would Little Ma ever dual cultivate with me?!”

“Heavens - we really dual cultivated!!!”

Her heart raced with giddy joy, overwhelmed by a happiness she’d never known.

No one knew how long it went on, but at last, the military seed was complete.

“It’s finally done.” Ning Zhuo felt like he might collapse from exhaustion.

Qing Chi, on the other hand, looked as though she could keep going.

Ning Zhuo pulled her out of the well and gave her a stern warning: she was not to speak a word of the refinement process to anyone.

He added, “And don’t get any strange ideas. This wasn’t dual cultivation in the proper sense - we didn’t exchange primordial yang or primordial yin at all.”

Qing Chi immediately asked, “Then when are we going to exchange them?”

Ning Zhuo: ...
