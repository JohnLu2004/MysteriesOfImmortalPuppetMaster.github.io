Chapter 162: A Petal Unfolds

Ning Ze listened quietly, his gaze flickering slightly.

"So that's how it is." Only now did he understand part of what had transpired.

Ning Ze slowly nodded, "Lan'er, you did well."

Wang Lan said, "I'm still trembling with fear. Today was too dangerous. I never thought Xiao Zhuo would actually pull it off! I... I don't know how to face him."

"After all, he saved you and brought down that damned Ning Xiaoren." Ning Gui sighed, "This is exactly what I wanted to talk to you about. Xiao Zhuo..."

"I misjudged him before. I underestimated him too much."

"No matter if he had guidance from a higher power this time, just his demeanor and conduct at the banquet show that he is no ordinary person. From now on, we must follow closely behind him and support him as much as possible. Let Ji'er follow him. After all, they are cousins." Wang Lan was shocked, "Ah? Husband, you mean..."

Ning Ze glared, "Can't you see it? With Xiao Zhuo's reputation and talent, he will at least be an elder in the future. Didn't you see the elders from the other branches like Ning Houjun and Ning Youfu personally stepping in to support Xiao Zhuo and show goodwill?"

"Does Ji'er have talent? Xiao Zhuo's future is not something Ji'er can compare to. Let Ji'er follow Xiao Zhuo now, and the latter, out of past affection, will help Ji'er, saving him countless hardships." Wang Lan was worried, "But Ji'er and Xiao Zhuo's relationship, husband, you know it well. Although they are cousins, they have never gotten along since childhood. Their relationship is not good at all." Ning Ze shook his head, "You, you, you are just a woman after all."

"You haven't seen it clearly."

"Let me ask you, how is Xiao Zhuo's relationship with us as a couple?" Wang Lan hesitated and shook her head, "Not close."

Ning Ze snorted, "To be precise, it's very bad!"

"But this time, he cleared my name and saved me. Why? Is it because he is filial to us? Because he remembers our upbringing?" Wang Lan blinked and hesitated, "Although we favored Ji'er more, we did raise Xiao Zhuo."

Ning Ze shook his head, "The biggest reason Xiao Zhuo saved me is that he could rely on me to bring down Ning Xiaoren."

"Another reason is that I am his closest relative in this world."

"He wants to progress and rise high, so he must be impeccable in character. Therefore, he will certainly take care of us because of this blood relationship."

"From the banquet just now, I have confirmedâ€”Xiao Zhuo has this understanding and magnanimity!" Wang Lan said, "If that's the case, then why do we need to curry favor with Xiao Zhuo?"

Ning Ze shook his head again, "Xiao Zhuo will treat us well because our blood relationship is extremely close."

"By the same token, the main family will also see us as being on Xiao Zhuo's side because of this."

"Especially today, we testified against Ning Xiaoren! This means that even if we don't want to, we are seen as Xiao Zhuo's people."

"We are already tied to Xiao Zhuo. We share honor and disgrace together."

Wang Lan's eyes widened, "So that's how it is."

Ning Ze continued, "Since we are already deeply bound to Xiao Zhuo, why not go all out and support him fully?"

"He has talent and such magnanimity. Relying on him is not a bad thing."

Wang Lan fell into silence.

The boy she once looked down upon had now become the person their entire family needed to curry favor with and rely on.

This made her mindset difficult to adjust for a moment.

After a long time, she slowly nodded, her tone desolate, "Husband, you are right. We... we will rely on Xiao Zhuo."

Ning Ze nodded, "Tomorrow morning, I will explain this decision to Ji'er."

The couple discussed and then went to bed.

In Ning Zhuo's cultivation chamber, he was still completing today's practice.

Amidst layers of floating clouds, his entire body was covered in a blood-red glow, forming membranes that covered his upper body, with a few covering his lower body, making him look as if he was wearing a layer of blood armor.

The Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique had already reached the peak of the sixth layer.

But the Demonic Blood Vein Technique and Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique still had plenty of room for improvement.

Ning Zhuo focused on the Demonic Blood Vein Technique.

Because according to his estimation, "By bringing down Ning Xiaoren, I will be a prominent figure for a while, the focus of the clan's discussions."

"The main family won't be foolish enough to withhold my rewards."

"Ning Xiaohui's achievements are far inferior to mine. My chances of obtaining the Ice Jade Wine are very high!"

Ning Zhuo planned to use the Ice Jade Wine to boost his cultivation, so the Demonic Blood Vein Technique, which had no shortcuts, became his current focus.

The arduous task of refining blood essence was over.

Ning Zhuo slowly opened his eyes and exhaled a breath of turbid air.

He began to ponder the current situation.

"Today, I brought down Ning Xiaoren, becoming famous throughout the clan, widely known."

"In the coming period, I need to recruit as many branch family members as possible to formally rise."

"I need to complete this quickly, the sooner the better."

"Once this favorable wind passes, it will be much harder to rise again!"

"As for the account with Ning Ze's family, it can be settled slowly in the future."

Sun Lingtong had always taught him to repay kindness and avenge grievances.

Ning Zhuo had grown up in the Ning family and was very familiar with its dynamics.

It was precisely because he understood the conflicts between the main and branch families so well that he could easily exploit them to bring down Ning Xiaoren.

Ning Xiaoren's existence had already hindered Ning Zhuo's progress and had to be removed.

Ning Zhuo had never thought of leaving the family and rashly cooperating with outsiders.

He was very clear about the value of his identity as a Ning family member.

The identity of a Ning family member helped him grow steadily and make progress.

If he were not a Ning family member, Zheng Jian, Zhou Zesheng, and others would treat Ning Zhuo very differently.

The pressure from Zhu Xuanji's investigation also made Ning Zhuo choose to continue hiding within the family.

After obtaining the embryonic form of the Life-Hanging Thread Divine Ability, Ning Zhuo was even more certain that his Ning family identity could not be easily discarded.

Because once the Life-Hanging Thread was planted, it could exist for a long time.

It was very beneficial for fate energy, making Ning Zhuo understand that uniting more clan members around him was greatly advantageous!

"Speaking of the Life-Hanging Thread... today I accidentally observed that many of my classmates' Life-Hanging Threads have become thicker and more laborious."

"I clearly haven't used the embryonic form of the divine ability on them again."

"Could it be that because I brought down Ning Xiaoren and my reputation increased, they are more inclined to follow me?"

With a turn of thought, Ning Zhuo thought of another key point.

"Has my communication jade slip already been transferred from Chen Cha to Fei Si?"

Ning Zhuo had secretly used his relationship with Fei Si to deal with Ning Xiaoren.

Fei Si had previously appreciated Ning Zhuo, and causing internal strife in the Ning family was beneficial to the City Lord's Mansion, so the possibility of Fei Si requesting the City Lord's Mansion to use their insider in the Ning family was high.

As a result, it worked!

However, the City Lord's Mansion would not expose their key insider to Ning Zhuo because of this.

So, Ning Zhuo could only guess at the banquet which branch family member present might be the insider for the City Lord's Mansion.

"The Ning family's main and branch families... and the City Lord's Mansion's insider..."

"I didn't even need to use the Buddha Heart Demon Seal or the Life-Hanging Thread, and I achieved this."

"Everyone's desires, the conflicts between groups, the rules of the righteous forces' operations, aren't they all strings?"

"I just need to follow the trend to make them act as I wish."

"Each action combined can shape the situation as I want."

"Isn't this another level of 'following the spirit'?"

Ning Zhuo thought of how he had previously taken measures to strengthen his control over Yuan Dasheng during the Wisdom Spirit Stage by constantly aligning with his spirit.

"The reason I succeeded this time was that I guided them according to their thoughts."

"Life-Hanging Thread..."

As Ning Zhuo thought of this, a flash of inspiration appeared in his mind.

The inspiration flickered, and when Ning Zhuo subconsciously tried to grasp it, it disappeared.

"Was it my illusion?"

"I seemed to feel that the lotus bud of the embryonic form of the divine ability trembled slightly, as if it opened a petal?"
