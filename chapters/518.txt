Chapter 518: The Whiskered Dragon King vs. Du Tiechuan

Dragon King Giant Wood Mountain!

This was the tallest, upright mountain peak in the entire Thousand Peaks Forest.

It was as high as a thousand zhang, standing between heaven and earth, having endured the honing of wind and rain and the erosion of time.

When it began to tilt, the entire world seemed to lose its balance in an instant.

The mountain’s ridge was as straight as if carved by a knife, the cliff walls were precipitous, the cliffs were rugged, and every rock and every crevice of the mountain had accumulated countless years of buildup.

In addition to the rocks, there were tens of thousands of temples on the mountain.

These temples came in various sizes; the small ones were nothing more than niches, while the large ones could cover a hundred mu, clustered around the mid-mountain, like a gigantic belt.

However, all this splendor was ultimately unable to withstand the sudden twist of fate and the ferocity of war.

Boom—!

At the foot of the mountain, it was directly crushed by the Iron Flow strategy, and the entire mountain body toppled, with a force of billions of jin crashing onto the mountain ground.

The tremendous noise was deafening, resounding throughout heaven and earth.

The dust swept up by the raging wind soared into the air, rising to several hundred zhang, like a layer of thick black fog that almost swallowed the entire sky.

The dust in the air spread for several miles, covering all around, and between heaven and earth everything turned a dull yellow, with even the brilliance of the sun being obscured at that moment.

The collapse of the mountain propelled countless rocks and chunks of earth to fall, with dust swirling in the air and fragments flying about, and the ensuing mudslide swept crazily, as a massive amount of soil, sand, and vegetation rolled down like a flood, and countless dull sounds emanated from the valleys.

The surrounding mountains and vegetation, which had once been lush with greenery, were rendered non-existent in the face of this earth-shattering disaster. Clusters of trees were knocked down and torn apart, falling like straw under the fierce impact of the collapsing mountain.

Those shattered stone blocks, numbering in the millions, poured down from the sky like a torrential rain, and the impact force generated when they struck the ground made everyone shudder with fear.

Every stone that fell brought with it a storm, raising dust and scattering hundreds to thousands of fragments in every direction.

The nearby mountain masses shook violently, and some connected peaks also collapsed, or were struck and broken in half.

Boom, boom, boom!

Yet again, a series of roaring sounds erupted, and the land within a hundred-mile radius trembled violently.

The mountain's outline was no longer complete, the piled-up rocks completely obscured the valleys and forests. The air was filled with the smell of earth and dust, unbearably choking.

And amidst the smoke and debris, the heavy-armored main force continued to march proudly, their charge never pausing for a moment!

“Crush the Dragon King Giant Wood Mountain!” Du Tiechuan ordered in a cold voice.

Although the Dragon King Giant Wood Mountain had collapsed, countless Dragon King temples on the mountain radiated divine light, enveloping the mountain and providing heavy protection.

Therefore, while the surrounding peaks were ravaged into complete ruin, the Dragon King Giant Wood Mountain itself remained relatively intact. At least on the sides that had not collided with the ground, it was basically unscathed.

At the command of Du Tiechuan, countless heavy-armored soldiers were filled with fervor, united as one, charging towards their target.

If they were truly to charge through, the Dragon King Giant Wood Mountain would absolutely be unable to withstand them.

At the critical moment, the Whiskered Dragon King had no choice but to take action.

Countless dragon whiskers pierced through the mountain, heedless of sacrifice, launching an unending encirclement attack.

Although the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King was powerful, the Iron Flow Levels the Plains military strategy was like an integrated whole, showing no sign of disintegration in a short time.

As it appeared that the Iron Flow was about to sweep through the Dragon King Giant Wood Mountain……

At that moment, an overwhelmingly powerful pressure suddenly spread, and even heaven and earth seemed to dim a bit; the air was torn by a tremendous force, and almost every cultivator had their heart skip a beat, feeling an inexplicable fear and sense of crisis.

The ground suddenly rose steeply!

A few breaths later, the surface of the earth suddenly burst open, and the massive main body of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King broke through the soil!

The dragon head, as mighty as a mountain, resembled a fortress; its dragon pupils were of a golden-orange hue, exuding a terrifying pressure, such that anyone could feel His overwhelming roar!

The sturdy dragon body, lacking metallic dragon scales and not as agile or slender as a normal dragon, instead appeared bloated and corpulent.

Hundreds upon hundreds of Ginseng whiskers tore through the air, dancing wildly in midair.

A surging wave of qi surrounded Him, sweeping out in all directions.

The Dragon King's body kept rising, standing proudly on the battlefield, and his gigantic dragon body gave an overwhelming sense of oppression, as if it could block out the sky and the sun.

Roar—!

He opened his mouth and exhaled a stream of earthy-yellow dragon breath.

Great Earth Breath!

The Soul Formation level dragon breath, carrying the terrifying power of the earth, hit the Iron Flow military strategy dead center.

Countless soldiers, including Ning Zhuo, simultaneously let out a painful groan, feeling the incomparable heavy pressure suddenly strike them.

The jet-black steel torrent came to an abrupt halt, stirring up thousands of ripples, as the part struck by the dragon breath rapidly spread out in all directions.

And the large groups of heavy-armored soldiers that were hit head-on by the dragon breath were all turned into stone statues, and then shattered into the finest fragments of soil.

Du Tiechuan and the others had already withdrawn from the forefront, and upon seeing this scene, their pupils contracted in alarm.

The combat power of the Iron Flow had long been at the Soul Formation Level.

Now, with morale as high as a rainbow, their combat power soared, reaching the high end of the Soul Formation Level.

Even so, they were still struck by the Whiskered Dragon King's full-force blow, which immediately wiped out 30% of their troops on the spot!

Du Tiechuan did not act to protect the main force, but instead was formulating military strategies.

He held his sharp sword, unleashing a brilliant sword light.

Military Strategy – Swords Drawn and Crossbows Bent.

Sword Technique – Ten Thousand Zhang of Sharpness.

Sword Technique – One Sword Seals the Throat!

A move in which military strategy and sword technique intermingled; this was Du Tiechuan's full-force strike.

The sword light, though seemingly slow, was actually fast, and in an instant, hit the main body of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King.

The Dragon King let out a wail; although at the critical moment he tilted his head to avoid the vital point, there was still a huge sword wound on his neck.

Du Tiechuan's sword cut through more than half of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King's neck!

The earthy-yellow dragon blood gushed out like a waterfall.

Wherever the dragon blood reached, it quickly solidified and formed a scab, rapidly healing the wound on the neck.

Although the Dragon King suffered a heavy blow, at that moment he demonstrated the formidable healing power of his true body!

The Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King gasped for breath, then once again exhaled the Great Earth Breath.

Du Tiechuan still did not choose to protect the main force, and unleashed a second sword light, continuing his full-force attack.

Boom……

The heavy-armored main force was once again reduced, instantly losing 10% of its troops, and with the bonus from military strategy nullified, the jet-black iron flow's afterimage suddenly disintegrated.

Countless soldiers reverted to their true form, fell to the ground, with sounds of painful groans and agonized screams.

Everyone was injured, and some were mortally wounded on the spot.

On the body of the Whiskered Dragon King, another terrifying wound was added.

Du Tiechuan nearly cut him in half at the waist!

“Prepare to die!” Du Tiechuan roared as he broke away from his troops and lunged forward.

He raised his sword high and brought it down overhead.

The Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King's aura was now less than half of what it had been before, and he suddenly leaned forward, with countless dragon whiskers attaching themselves to the body of the Dragon King Giant Wood Mountain.

Dao Field – Earth Dragon Nest!

In an instant, the battlefield within a hundred-mile radius was tainted, becoming a world of earthy yellow.

The earth rolled, and giant dragons formed from converging rocks and soil burst out of the surface, charging towards the diminutive Du Tiechuan.

Du Tiechuan wanted to take flight, but was soon sucked back down to the ground.

The gravity of this Dao Field was altered and targeted according to the Whiskered Dragon King's will.

Not only was it difficult for Du Tiechuan to take a step, but even raising his hand, speaking, and other movements, he felt as if he were being dragged by an invisible enormous force, making every action extremely laborious.

Du Tiechuan snorted coldly, not surprised.

The intelligence collected by the two nations had long since detailed the might of the Whiskered Dragon King.

He was originally a demon cultivator, and his true body was extremely powerful. He had also become the indigenous deity of the Thousand Peaks Forest, enjoying worship, possessing a Dao Field, making him even more formidable!

Du Tiechuan took out his command seal and threw out a token: “Come out and fight!”

Accompanied by his command, the dispatched military order token suddenly emitted a dazzling brilliance.

In the next breath, the brilliance completely dissipated, and out of thin air appeared a monstrous demon beast as huge as a small mountain.

Soul Formation level National Beast — Two-Headed Badger.

Its body length was a full three zhang, with a shoulder height of about two zhang.

Both of its heads, one on the left and one on the right, had huge fangs that shimmered with a cold light.

Its neck was sturdy, with layers of fleshy ridges, and its muscles were as firm as a crescent moon.

Its limbs were like four gigantic pillars, solid and powerful; each claw was like a sharp steel pincer, with nails about one foot long, capable of easily slicing through steel armor.

Its tail was extremely robust, about two zhang in length, and at the end of its tail were spikes, resembling hundreds of long spears gathered together.

Once the Two-Headed Badger was released, it immediately went into battle.

One head spewed fire, the other exhaled frost, targeting the main body of the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King, scorching the left side of his dragon body to jet black, and freezing the right side into an icy layer.

Boom, boom, boom……

Du Tiechuan, the Two-Headed Badger, and the main body of the Whiskered Dragon King engaged in the most intense battle.

No one dared to enter the Dao Field to participate in this battle. The mere aftershocks alone caused all the Nascent Soul-level cultivators to shrink back.

Du Tiechuan was bolstered by both military might and national strength, while the Whiskered Dragon King also had the advantage of his powerful Dao Field. From the very beginning, the attack and slaughter between both sides was fought with utmost effort.

Every move was executed with all-out effort, aiming precisely at the vital points. If a single move could kill the opponent, a second strike would never be used!

The Two-Headed Badger howled in agony, and soon fell from grievous injuries.

Although it was aided by national strength, its overall combat ability was not on par with Du Tiechuan or the Whiskered Dragon King.

Even at the Soul Formation Level, there was a gap.

Demon Technique – Dragon Whisker Bind the Heavens.

Divine Technique – Dragon King Divine Prison.

Demon God Technique – Burial Life Dragon Abyss!

Countless dragon whiskers in the Dao Field transformed into innumerable talismans.

The talismans connected one after another, forming chains that bound Du Tiechuan.

For a moment, Du Tiechuan was as if trapped like a tiny mosquito in a vast spider’s web.

Du Tiechuan snorted coldly, his body covered in blood, and mustered his remaining strength to unleash his final strike.

Sword Technique – Heaven-Cleaving Sword Qi.

Sword Technique – Thunderous Azure Edge!

Military Strategy – Tian Gang Dao Soldier Battle Formation.

Military Strategy – The Empty City Ruse.

His sword qi surged towards the heavens, accompanied by azure lightning. The aura of his robust energy erupted all around him, transforming into thirty-six Tian Gang Dao Soldiers, who swiftly formed a battle array around him.

In the end, the three powers merged under the Empty City Ruse military strategy, transforming into a martial battle sword —Tian Gang Slash the Empty Thunder!

Boom!

Thunder roared, breaking countless talisman chains.

The dragon whiskers shattered, scattering earthy-yellow dragon blood all over the sky.

The semi-transparent sword light struck the main body of the Whiskered Dragon King, causing a terrifying internal explosion.

On the spot, it blew a huge hole in the Whiskered Dragon King, and his dragon body was nearly split into two pieces.

His dragon body was shattered in countless ways, and from hundreds and thousands of wounds, extremely sharp martial sword qi was ejected.

The Whiskered Dragon King let out a wail, transformed into a streak of yellow light, and escaped underground!

On Du Tiechuan’s body, there still remained a dozen or so talisman chains, and he did not have time to pursue.

He could only strike again, severing the Whiskered Dragon King’s Dao Field.

As the Dao Field disintegrated into pieces, from deep underground, another pained roar of the Dragon King resounded.

The roar quickly faded, indicating that the Dragon King was retreating deeper underground.

“We have won!”

“We won!!”

“Quickly retreat, quickly retreat.”

The two national armies cheered in unison, while on the side of the Thousand Peaks Forest allied forces, they retreated without a fight; even some Nascent Soul-level cultivators looked dismal and their hearts were in panic.

Countless adoring gazes converged upon Du Tiechuan.

This Soul Formation level general, with a face like iron and a determined expression, dragged along a dozen or so talisman chains, and floated above the battlefield.

He ordered loudly that a military camp be established right here.

Over forty formation masters floated into the air, brandishing the talismans in their hands.

Countless talismans fell like raindrops.

Beams of light interwove in the air, quickly converging into a massive three-dimensional formation array. The array covered over a hundred mu, and was extremely magnificent.

Then, over sixty artifact refiners, paying out of their own pockets, took out the semi-finished treasure materials that they had already refined.

They threw the treasure materials into the formation array, fitting each light point or ray, and filled various magical treasures, weapons, and military flags in places like the array’s foot and the array’s eye.

Soon, the formation array turned from illusion into reality, becoming a gigantic military camp.

Though it was called a military camp, it looked more like a small city.

The main structure of the city used Canghai wood, Shendiao stone, and Qingcheng iron, with an overall bronze-like hue, solemn and dignified.

There were numerous watchtowers along the edges of the city, and military flags fluttered on the walls.

Inside the city, there were numerous barracks, as well as open spaces and training fields.

At the very center was the Commander-in-Chief’s main hall; on the red-copper pillars around the hall, there were totems of the Four Symbols—the Black Tortoise, the Azure Dragon, the White Tiger, and the Vermilion Bird—carved separately, exuding majestic grandeur.

Du Tiechuan landed in the Commander-in-Chief’s main hall, and threw out a series of military order tokens.

The city’s gates on all sides opened wide, emanating a strong suction force, which, according to the markings on the military order tokens, sucked in each heavy-armored main force unit into the city for detailed arrangement.

Meanwhile, the formation masters continued to set up fortifications.

They first set up a Blue Sea Soldier Tide Array around the small city. Then, in the middle ring, they set up a Thunder Net Locking-the-Sky Array. Finally, in the outer layer, they formed an integrated offensive and defensive Blue Moon Flying Shield Array.

The three layers of formation complemented each other, forming a complete defensive barrier with no blind spots.

Once the formation array was set up, it was successfully activated.

The cultivators in charge of logistics then left the city and began to clean up the battlefield.

Du Tiechuan gathered all the main generals into the command hall.

He coughed a few times, spat blood in front of everyone, and stated plainly: “The Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King and I fought to the death, resulting in mutual grievous injuries. In a short time, we must actively recuperate and strive for a swift recovery.”

“You must actively sweep through every mountain top, and with all your might, exterminate the Dragon King’s followers, raze the mountains and destroy the temples, severing the source of their worship.”

“Only in this way, by accumulating little by little and gathering advantages, can we ultimately achieve victory!”

The main generals exchanged glances, and for a moment there was silence in the hall.

Du Tiechuan snorted coldly and immediately announced that in the upcoming battles, rewards and promotions would be given based on merit without delay.

The generals were greatly encouraged and responded in unison.
