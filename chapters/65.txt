Chapter 65: The Fire Persimmon Festival

Every time the Fire Persimmon Festival arrived, Fire Persimmon Immortal City would become a ghost town. The city residents would leave the immortal city and head into the wilderness along the mountainside and foothills.

At that time, Fire Persimmon Forest would be partially opened to the public.

Both mortals and cultivators would participate in the harvest of fire persimmons.

It was a grand celebration for the entire city. Since the year it was founded by the very first City Lord, the festival had never once been suspended.

This year’s Fire Persimmon Festival was quite different from those in the past.

Some months ago, Chi Dun’s pursuit of the black shadow demonic cultivator had shaken the entire city.

Even those residents who didn’t witness it personally had heard from others how the black shadow demonic cultivator had been driven into Fire Persimmon Forest and sealed within the layers of formations.

Before this year’s Fire Persimmon Festival even began, Fei Si had already taken charge of the city’s defense, placing the entire city under martial law.

On the day of Fire Persimmon Festival, the City Lord sat high atop Fire Persimmon Mountain and personally activated the immortal city’s grand formation.

Countless green formation patterns appeared in the air, throughout the city, and on the ground, crisscrossing in majestic lines.

And that was only the portion visible to the naked eye; the majority of the formation existed deep in the body of Fire Persimmon Mountain, continuously drawing in earth energy and lava and channeling it into every corner of Fire Persimmon Immortal City to power various alchemy rooms, artifact crafting rooms, mechanical workshops, and other facilities.

The place that consumed the most lava and earth energy was none other than Fire Persimmon Forest.

The fire persimmon trees absorbed the lava and earth energy and turned it into fire persimmons.

Fire persimmons could serve as fuel like fire essence, could be eaten, could be used for alchemy or artifact crafting… there were countless uses.

When the city was first built, Fire Persimmon Forest was just a small patch of trees. Now, it had spread across almost the entire mountain base, wrapping the foot of Fire Persimmon Mountain in a magnificent fiery red ring.

Under the watchful gaze of countless city residents, large numbers of Foundation Establishment stage cultivators headed out of the city.

These cultivators were mostly from the City Lord Mansion and the three major clans. A few came from trusted factions like the Monkey Head Gang.

Each Foundation Establishment cultivator brought with them several mechanical monkeys.

Yuan Dasheng followed beside Yuan Er. Its massive and burly figure stood out among the cultivators leaving the city.

“Let’s move out too.”

Ning Zhuo, Chen Cha, and other mechanical cultivators also secretly left the city.

These cultivators were there for on-the-spot repairs; this was one of Fei Si’s measures to prevent accidents.

After exiting the city, they didn’t go directly down into Fire Persimmon Forest, but instead entered a well-hidden and well-protected formation on the mountainside.

The formation also displayed the scene within Fire Persimmon Forest, making it easier for the mechanical cultivators to monitor the mechanical monkeys in real time and identify any issues.

On the mountainside, Zhu Xuanji concealed his presence and quietly gazed at Fire Persimmon Forest.

Chi Dun did the same, hiding who knows where.

The Golden Core cultivators of the three major clans also remained out of sight, secretly deployed by the City Lord Mansion and stationed around Fire Persimmon Forest.

A net to capture the black shadow demonic cultivator had already been deployed.

“Begin.” Fei Si, the only Golden Core cultivator appearing out in the open, oversaw the entire operation.

With a single command, the many Foundation Establishment cultivators charged into Fire Persimmon Forest with their mechanical monkeys.

In the past few days, the Foundation Establishment cultivators of the three major clans had been rigorously practicing mechanical arts and honing their skills at controlling mechanical monkeys.

Generally speaking, a single Foundation Establishment cultivator could control at least three mechanical monkeys to pick fire persimmons.

Seeing the countless mechanical monkeys leaping into the flaming red persimmon forest, Yuan Er grew slightly anxious and gave a final rallying cry: “Brothers, it’s all up to you now.

“Give it everything you’ve got, and show everyone that our Monkey Head Gang is the best at harvesting fire persimmons!”

Fire Persimmon Forest was divided by formations into countless layers according to the age of the fire persimmons.

At first, only the areas with fire persimmons under ten years old were opened.

The mechanical monkeys constantly harvested persimmons. Every time they picked one, it would be absorbed into the storage formation embedded in their chests.

Looking from above, it could be seen that the fire persimmons were vanishing rapidly, leaving only the fiery red leaves clinging to the branches.

Once the mechanical monkeys reached max capacity, they were remotely recalled by the Foundation Establishment cultivators.

They returned to a massive circular formation and spit out the stored fire persimmons, piling them on the ground.

Once a pile reached one zhang in height, the formation activated and teleported the fire persimmons directly into the City Lord Mansion’s granary.

After all the fire persimmon under ten years old were harvested, Fei Si opened the section with those over ten years old.

Once those were gathered, it was time for the twenty-year fire persimmons, then the thirty-year…

The age kept increasing, until it reached one hundred years.

Boom!

With a loud sound, a fire persimmon exploded.

Almost instantly, it triggered a chain reaction among the surrounding fire persimmons.

Terrifying flames swiftly engulfed over a dozen explosive fire monkeys. As for the Foundation Establishment controllers, they were far enough away and suffered no casualties.

In that moment, countless gazes turned toward the scene of the explosion.

Fei Si frowned and immediately ordered an investigation.

A Foundation Establishment cultivator from Zhou Clan was quickly brought forward.

Fei Si’s face was expressionless. “You were the one who mishandled the mechanical monkey?”

The Zhou Clan Foundation Establishment cultivator’s face was pale as he nodded weakly. He wanted to defend himself, but he knew clearly that with the grand formation active, everything was being recorded from all angles. Any lies would be exposed immediately, and he would have to suffer even more severe consequences.

Fei Si’s brows furrowed slightly. “You’ll be paying for all the destroyed fire persimmons later. You have half a cup of tea’s time to calm your mind, then resume your duties.”

“Yes.” The Zhou Clan cultivator accepted the order and stepped back.

Boom.

After a short while, a mechanical monkey suddenly malfunctioned. While retrieving a fire persimmon, it bumped against another and triggered an explosion.

Fei Si reviewed the footage and confirmed it was a fault in the mechanical monkey itself. He immediately traced the monkey’s serial number back to its manufacturing workshop.

It was the Flying Disk Workshop.

Fei Si promptly ordered his men to notify Chen Cha and Ning Zhuo.

A messenger was sent, carrying a reprimand from Fei Si.

Inside the formation where the mechanical cultivators were stationed, a replay of the moment before the explosion was being shown. The focus of the footage was the malfunctioning mechanical monkey.

After watching the footage, Chen Cha quickly came to a conclusion. “That mechanical monkey had been in use for too long. Its structure melted and degraded, which is what caused the malfunction.”

Chen Cha turned to look at Ning Zhuo.

This mechanical monkey was one of the low-quality ones produced from Ning Zhuo’s revised blueprint.

Ning Zhuo mused, “The temperature in the hundred-year area of Fire Persimmon Forest seems a bit higher than in previous years. Have the Foundation Establishment cultivators pause for now. Crush some Clear Dew Pills and mix them with water, then pour the solution over the mechanical monkeys. Be sure to soak them thoroughly, to the point that water collects on the surface.”

After giving these instructions, Ning Zhuo resumed repairing mechanical monkeys.

Ever since the festival started, damaged and malfunctioning mechanical monkeys had been continually sent over for repairs before being rushed back into the field.

As time passed, more and more mechanical monkeys were breaking down, causing Ning Zhuo and the others to get busier and busier. Eventually, they started struggling to keep up.

Sweating profusely, Chen Cha took the chance to remind Ning Zhuo, “Little Zhuo, do you see now? This is what cutting corners gets you.”

Ning Zhuo sighed. “Old Chen, isn’t this failure rate exactly what I was aiming for?

“Besides, many of these mechanical monkeys were damaged due to operator error. That’s not my fault.”

The hardship was only temporary. Soon, the number of mechanical monkeys being sent for repairs began to decrease.

This was because the teams had finished harvesting the hundred-year fire persimmon and were now entering the thousand-year area of Fire Persimmon Forest.

Thousand-year-old fire persimmons were as big as washbasins, born from the boundless earth energy and lava drawn out by the grand formation. Each one was extremely valuable.

The Foundation Establishment cultivators all became cautious, each putting all their focus into operating a single mechanical monkey.

If any of these fire persimmons exploded and triggered a chain reaction, it was enough to wipe out all of a Foundation Establishment cultivator’s savings!

Since each person was only operating one mechanical monkey, it was only natural that the number of monkeys sent in for repairs decreased.
