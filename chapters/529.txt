Chapter 529: If Fate Brings You Harm

The water waves surged, churning ceaselessly.

Golden rays shot forth, and soil and rocks flew everywhere. Occasionally, flames took shape and wooden strips danced in the air.

The Five Element Spells were alternately employed in Ning Zhuo’s hands, pressing the Golden Core cultivator Yan Jin so that he could not raise his head.

“Damn it!”

“Even with the treasure artifact big bell in hand, he could only end up at a disadvantage.”

“This kid -was he really only sixteen years old?”

Yan Jin gritted his teeth and did his best to hold on.

In the next moment, he widened his eyes in shock and discovered that the big bell before him had begun to crack all over.

He could still hold on, but the treasure artifact big bell was nearing its limit.

After all, this big bell was never meant to be a weapon of assault; rather, it was an auxiliary tool specifically crafted for refining artifacts.

“Oh, it’s about to give out.”

Ning Zhuo’s heart stirred, and he keenly noticed this scene.

He decisively reduced the force of his strikes and the frequency of his spellcasting.

Yan Jin immediately felt his pressure greatly eased.

A surge of sorrow and indignation arose in his heart: “I, a senior cultivator, have ended up as nothing more than a live target in the face of a sixteen‐year‐old boy.”

“This kid is not even a proper human, so I’ll rehearse his spells!”

Yan Jin felt deeply humiliated.

Ning Zhuo grew even more excited.

“So, could I really be this powerful?”

“It was all because my physical foundation had grown far stronger, allowing me to receive further augmentations from the Hero's Return Technique and Martial Strategy.”

“The stronger my strength, the greater the might of my spells.”

“Now, my only weakness was my insufficient spiritual power. However, I also had military power available to expend in its stead.”

Having experienced numerous wars firsthand, Ning Zhuo understood that an army’s military power functioned as a public pool of spiritual power -one whose capacity often far exceeded that of an individual.

Ning Zhuo’s mechanized army’s combat power, of course, was no match for the Red Flower Battalion or the Three Generals Battalion, but don’t forget-Ning Zhuo had built an army on his own.

The entire military power was at his disposal!

“Boss, speaking of which, you’re still the most formidable.”

“Had it not been for you thinking of the proper usage of the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat, I would never have advanced so greatly in such a short time!”

Inside the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, Sun Lingtong chuckled and said without any humility, “Of course!”

Ning Zhuo did not know that at that moment, Sun Lingtong’s mood was even happier than his.

“Little Zhuo, I hadn’t seen your so cheerful a smile for such a long time.”

Sun Lingtong’s gaze, like drifting clouds and mist, seemed in a daze to see the past.

When he first conversed with Ning Zhuo, the latter had burst into tears.

In order to save his mother, his tiny body had borne a heavy shackle. From as early as the age of two, he had begun plotting the Lava Immortal Palace; facing the City Lord’s Residence, the three major clans, and numerous Golden Core-level as well as even Nascent Soul-level cultivators, it was as if an ant were challenging a mountain.

What an enormous pressure that was!

However, Sun Lingtong could not persuade Ning Zhuo to change his mind.

Because he himself was of the same kind.

In order to rescue his own master, Sun Lingtong had, on numerous occasions, disregarded his own life and safety, risking death to infiltrate the Lava Immortal Palace.

Time after time he was injured, narrowly escaped death, was disappointed repeatedly, and drew ever closer to despair.

“Now, I have come out, but Little Zhuo has not yet!”

Ning Zhuo had never hidden his plan to save his mother from Sun Lingtong.

“Relying solely on spiritual essence for resurrection?”

Sun Lingtong knew well that this plan was so impractical, with hope being extremely slim.

“Even if it were a matter of soul usurpation, there were enormous drawbacks -it would have the soul constantly pulled by the netherworld. On the day it fell into the netherworld, the soul would suffer even more excruciating punishment!”

“Resurrecting the dead, even within the path of demons, was a grave taboo. To succeed was extraordinarily difficult, and the price paid was often far greater than the rewards!”

But Sun Lingtong could not persuade Ning Zhuo, because he himself had done the same before and had no such qualification.

He once had devoted his heart entirely to retrieving his mentor -even at the risk of death, he had no hesitation.

But gradually, a new worry arose in Sun Lingtong’s heart -if he died, what would become of Little Zhuo?

As he spent more and more time with Ning Zhuo, that worry increasingly dominated his heart.

“My life, my destiny, was saved by you, Little Zhuo!”

“Therefore, no matter how difficult this path to save your mother might be, I would always accompany you.”

“It’s just that……”

Being experienced, Sun Lingtong sincerely did not wish for Ning Zhuo to go down a path alone into darkness.

Therefore, even if Ning Zhuo only had the modest Foundation Establishment level, as long as he went out to travel, Sun Lingtong extended wholehearted welcome and support.

“Little Zhuo, the Fire Persimmon Immortal City was like a cage -a heavy shackle on your body and mind.”

“The longer you stayed in the city, the more you schemed about the Lava Immortal Palace.”

“You had lived in the Fire Persimmon Immortal City for too long; you had grown up there, enduring in silence for sixteen years -but endurance was by no means the main flavor of life, Little Zhuo.”

The experiences of venturing out allowed Ning Zhuo to see many different vistas and ways of life.

In the war of the two nations, Ning Zhuo felt both fear and excitement.

Fierce battles and wars were the most ardent longing hidden within every male being.

“Your past self was like a suppressed volcano; your anger, your unwillingness, your schemes, your ambitions -all had to be forcefully restrained and hidden deep within your heart, until one day when they erupted, it was as if a stone broke the heavens.”

“But now the heroic spirit of the battlefield had already infected you, Little Zhuo.”

Ambush battles, scouting battles in the Thousand Peak Forest, and the grand battle of the Iron Flow across the Plain…

Liu, Guan, Zhang, Mu Lan, Shuang Jing, Gu Ya, Tu Ming…

These battles and these people all had an imperceptible influence on Ning Zhuo.

The onlooker sees things clearly.

Ning Zhuo believed that his strength had greatly improved, and he felt extremely delighted.

However, Sun Lingtong knew that if it was the Ning Zhuo who had just left the Fire Persimmon Immortal City encountering such matters, he would only have a slight upturn of his lips, secretly pleased that such changes would help in resurrecting his mother.

And there would never be such a cheerful smile.

“You are only sixteen; this is the smile a youth should have.”

“Just continue venturing on like this.”

“Go and witness all the ugliness and beauty, go and experience all kinds of thrills and interesting things.”

“Life inherently has infinite possibilities, with countless different ways to live.”

“Your life cannot consist solely of arduous and grand goals; it must also be fun, brilliant, and radiant!”

All along, Sun Lingtong had this concern -if in the future Ning Zhuo’s plan to resurrect his mother completely failed, what kind of heavy blow would he suffer?

Would he, like the former Sun Lingtong, become heartless and devoid of the joy of life?

Therefore, Sun Lingtong very much hoped that Ning Zhuo could experience the many beauties of life.

He wanted to see Ning Zhuo interact with Lin Shanshan, and also wanted to see Ning Zhuo engage in dual cultivation with Mu Lan -not merely to watch the spectacle.

And as Sun Lingtong accompanied Ning Zhuo on his journey, his motive was very simple and pure-

“Little Zhuo.”

“If a cruel fate inflicted harm and hardship upon you, deprived you of happiness, and burdened you with heavy loads.”

“Then, let me make up for it all!”

This was a decision long made deep within Sun Lingtong’s heart.

Collapse.

Under Ning Zhuo’s increasingly fierce assault, the treasure artifact big bell finally reached its limit and collapsed with a tremendous roar, shattering into countless pieces.

Having continuously propelled the big bell, Yan Jin -who was closely connected -was then counterattacked, spitting blood as he knelt on the ground.

“Little Zhuo, here’s a good opportunity.”

Sun Lingtong shouted, “Capture him alive!”

“Okay, Boss!”

Ning Zhuo took a deep breath, formed hand seals with one hand to release deep green vines, and with the other hand took out a stack of talismans, directly activating them and launching them forth.

The vines quickly entwined, binding Yan Jin in a myriad of knots, restraining him in place.

The talismans consecutively struck him, adhering to every part of his body, firmly sealing him. Not only could he not mobilize his spiritual power, but even his divine sense could not be emitted -leaving him unable to move.

“Hahaha. I did it; this is the first enemy I’ve captured alive.”

Ning Zhuo rejoiced with a delighted laugh.

Amidst the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, Sun Lingtong gave a thumbs up, sincerely happy for Ning Zhuo: “Little Zhuo, impressive! You only had Foundation Establishment cultivation, yet you captured a Golden Core!”

Ning Zhuo flew down, and without rashly approaching Yan Jin, he instead mobilized his divine sense to observe and also cast a detection spell for confirmation.

While casting spells, he secretly communicated with Sun Lingtong: “What a pity -the big bell shattered first; I haven’t yet measured my own limit of endurance.”

Sun Lingtong chuckled, “Little Zhuo, you fool. This actually doesn’t have much significance, does it?”

Ning Zhuo was slightly stunned, and then immediately understood the implication in Sun Lingtong’s words.

Indeed.

Through the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat, his corporeal cultivation would continuously soar.

Now, so what if I measured my combat power limit?

In a while, it would change again.

Ning Zhuo’s expression turned serious, and he gradually walked over to Yan Jin: “Boss, you are right.”

“I did get a bit carried away.”

“The progress and achievements I have attained now are nothing.”

“Capturing a Golden Core? I merely relied on military tactics and the Five Elements realm -the former being bestowed upon me by the soldiers’ shared helmet and Gao Sheng's Posthumous Writings, and the latter taught by the Five Elements Divine Master.”

“Even my corporeal realm was achieved thanks to you, thanks to the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat; my own efforts accounted for very little.”

“Thank you, Boss.”

“You always manage to remind me in such a clever and tactful way!”

Sun Lingtong scratched his head, “Little Zhuo, this…”

At another battlefield.

Liu, Guan, and Zhang took turns deploying military tactics, continuously bombarding the fire curtain.

Three layers of fire curtain!

The Flowing Flame Fairy furrowed her brows and exerted the full might of her grand array.

Scorching heat waves rolled in, and many soldiers suddenly burst into flames -screaming as they were burned into human sticks.

The three generals -Liu, Guan, and Zhang -were either solemn, calm, or roaring with anger, and they all continuously deployed military tactics.

The Flowing Flame Fairy was invigorated in her heart, “We can hold them off!”

“The Three Generals Battalion had insufficient training, inadequate elite soldiers, and subpar equipment -so their military power was insufficient.”

“Their total military power simply could not support them in continuously launching three successive fierce tactical offensives.”

“Moreover, they had to reserve some military power to fortify themselves, in case they were completely incinerated by flames!”

However, in the next moment, Liu Er suddenly shouted, “At this very moment, launch a full-scale attack!”

Guan and Zhang obeyed without question.

Blade light split one layer of the fire curtain, the black spear pierced through the second layer, and sword light shredded the third layer!

“How is that possible? You actually saw through the key point of the fire curtain?!”

The Flowing Flame Fairy looked at Liu Er in disbelief.

Guan and Zhang, with overwhelming momentum and power, had expended more than half of their military power -so breaking through the fire curtain was not surprising.

The key was that Liu Er’s sword light, though very weak and having barely utilized any military power, had nevertheless precisely pierced the key point of the fire curtain, using ingenious force to shatter the final layer of defense.

Liu Er did not reply, but continued to swing his sword.

The sword light flew, aiming directly at the Flowing Flame Fairy’s throat.

“Don’t even think about it!”

The Flowing Flame Fairy shouted sharply, revealing her trump card.

Suddenly, intricate talismans appeared on her body, the talismans glowing crimson and burning like flames.

In an instant, the Flowing Flame Fairy transformed into a mass of humanoid flame.

Although the sword light struck the humanoid flame and directly severed its head, in the next moment the flames connected with one another and reformed into a complete humanoid shape.

“If you think you can kill me, you’re still far off.”

The Flowing Flame Fairy was about to retreat.

Talent -Purple-bearded Astonishing Hong!

Guan Hong finally regained his composure, releasing his innate talent, and immobilized the Flowing Flame Fairy.

“Ahhhhh!”

Zhang Hei leapt out of the battle formation, holding the Black Snake Spear high above his head, and fiercely stabbed down at the humanoid flame.

Martial Art -Black Python Strangulation!

Military power, spiritual power, and vigor blended together, forming on the spear tip a thick, black serpent-like aura of battle energy.

The raging, jet-black battle energy, like a black python spiraling in a flying thrust, in an instant pierced the humanoid flame.

Guan Hong suddenly half-kneeled on the ground, gasping for breath.

The Purple-bearded Astonishing Hong was retracted, and in an instant the Flowing Flame Fairy regained her mobility-only to see that she had been pierced by the Black Snake Spear.

“It’s useless, I am now the Fire Walking Magic Body, uh!”

In the next moment, the jet-black battle energy exploded forth like a black python opening its enormous jaws, directly devouring its prey.

The flames soared upward, erupting with dazzling brightness.

But it was nothing more than the Flowing Flame Fairy’s final, futile struggle.

The jet-black battle energy strangled all the flames, and they dissipated entirely.

Only a dim, broken Golden Core remained, drifting in midair before being snatched by Zhang Hei.

Zhang Hei landed on the ground, grasped the Golden Core in his fist, and raised it high: “The enemy has been slain by me!”

Alas!

The Three Generals Battalion erupted in enthusiastic cheers.

“Victory.”

Guan Hong exhaled a mouthful of turbid breath and slowly straightened his body.

Liu Er then quickly scanned the entire army, estimated the losses, and immediately issued orders to clear the battlefield and take over the array.

“Beneath this ground, there is an empty chamber, within which is hidden the Vermilion Bird Incense Burner.”

Following Liu Er’s instructions, the soldiers indeed unearthed this treasure that served as the core of the array.

“In this way, we would have control of the Ten Li Burning Forest grand array.”

Guan Hong smiled, feeling extremely gratified.

Zhang Hei then curiously asked, “Big brother, how did you discover its hidden nature? This underground chamber is so well arranged that it can shield against divine sense scans.”

Liu Er hesitated for a moment, but did not answer.

It was his innate talent for Spirit Sound Probe at work.

This talent enabled Liu Er to have exceptional hearing, to listen to distant sounds, to trace the origins and developments, and to discern the underlying matters.

The key was to trace the origins and developments.

Therefore, the investigative ability of the Spirit Sound Probe was weak, but its strength lay in getting to the root of things.

Not until the battle had reached this point did Liu Er slowly discern the origin of the fire curtain and the details of the array.

Previously, it was in the same manner that the key points on the fire curtain were discovered.

“No, we cannot control this Guardian Forest array for now.”

The three generals tried for a while, but all ended in failure.

“First, put away the Vermilion Bird Incense Burner and the like, and seal the grand array.”

Liu Er ordered, “We must immediately go to support the military strategist!”

Zhang Hei said boldly, “Rest assured, the sound of the bell has just ceased; the military strategist must have won!”

Guan Hong stroked his beard, “Precisely because of that, we should all the more go to support the military strategist.”

Zhang Hei: “Huh?”

Liu Er explained, “Just as we can no longer hear the bell, the military strategist would no longer be under attack from the fire curtain, and the fire in the Burning Forest would greatly subside. He would then realize that we had also defeated the Flowing Flame Fairy.”

“What do you think he would do?”

Zhang Hei said, “We found this place under your guidance, big brother. The military strategist, not knowing our location, would either return to the original separation point, or… directly strike at the central Fire Crown Divine Fir?”

Liu Er nodded, “That’s right. Up until now, Luo Chen has not appeared; he must have encountered some change or mishap.”

“Given the military strategist’s capability, it’s highly likely that he would rush there to investigate the military situation.”

Recalling how previously Ning Zhuo had faced Du Tiechuan’s summons without fear, while he himself had worried about being punished for slaying the Iron Eagle, Zhang Hei wholeheartedly agreed, “The military strategist really has guts! Then let us immediately head to the Fire Crown Divine Fir and join forces with the military strategist, hahaha!”
