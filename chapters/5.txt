Chapter 5: An Outstanding Mechanical Construct

The Flying Disk Workshop was a small and inconspicuous little workshop.

Inside this simple workshop, Chen Cha frowned as he looked at a semi-finished mechanical construct on the table.

Chen Cha was a black-robed old man with a gray beard and sunken eyes. Currently, he was sitting on a mechanical chair that floated several chi[^1] off the ground. His thoughts turned rapidly, but he couldn’t come up with a solution.

His blueprint had encountered another wall.

“Just how long will this one take to solve?” Chen Cha sighed.

There was no certainty when it came to designing mechanical blueprints. Sometimes, a problem could be figured out after one or two days, while other times, it might take weeks or months. In fact, the last time Chen Cha ran into a problem like this, it took a whole year to overcome it.

Chen Cha looked at the account book on his desk, and his expression darkened.

Designing an outstanding mechanical construct always required inspiration to come up with creative ideas. Chen Cha had a solid foundation and was particularly skilled in formations, but his creativity was lacking and flashes of insight were rare.

Back then, he didn’t think that this would be the case, so he had borrowed money to open this mechanical workshop. Unfortunately, reality gave him a hard slap in the face.

Not only had he used up his family’s assets, he was even burdened with external debt. When riding a tiger, it’s hard to get off; by now, even if he sold the whole workshop, it wouldn’t be enough.

It was too late for regrets. Chen Cha knew that his only way out was to design a breakout mechanical construct. Only something that would sell for tons of money in the market could save him.

Knock, knock, knock.

There was a knock on the door.

Chen Cha frowned slightly: "What is it?"

A voice came from beyond the door: "Master, a visitor has come and wants to ask you for advice."

Chen Cha nodded: "Bring him to me."

He was currently short of money and desperately needed to pay off his debts. Under normal circumstances, he wouldn’t take on any consultation requests, but he had no choice now but to make money wherever he could.

A while later, Ning Zhuo slowly walked into the workshop: “This junior is called Ning Zhuo. I’m here to meet Master Chen Cha.”

The old man grunted, appearing dignified but secretly looking Ning Zhuo up and down.

Ning Zhuo was wearing a clean white robe. His eyes were calm and clear, and his face was tender with youth.

Chen Cha’s gaze lingered on the jade pendant at Ning Zhuo’s waist.

That jade pendant was engraved with a single word – “Ning”.

“The Ning Clan?” Chen Cha’s eyes flickered.

Fire Persimmon Immortal City had four major forces. The first was the City Lord Mansion; the current city lord was a cultivator in the Nascent Soul stage. The other three were “Formations” Zhou Clan, “Artifacts” Zheng Clan, and “Talismans” Ning Clan.

Chen Cha felt slightly happy as he thought: “Since he’s from a big clan, this young man could be quite rich. I might be able to make a lot. I’ll point out some of his shortcomings later so he keeps asking questions.”

After signing a business contract, Chen Cha invited Ning Zhuo to take a seat. This contract bound both parties and ensured that they would keep the conversation strictly confidential.

Chen Cha took a sip of bitter tea, then asked Ning Zhuo for details with a calm expression.

Ning Zhuo explained that he was designing a blueprint for a mechanical construct and had run into a problem.

Chen Cha immediately smiled internally and thought to himself: “You too?”

However, he didn’t take it seriously.

As a mechanical arts cultivator, workshop owner, and purveyor of knowledge, he had encountered many people like this Ning Zhuo.

“Youngsters always think that they’re special.

“But the mechanical constructs they design are unbearably bad! Some even have contradictory structures, causing them to immediately collapse the moment magical power enters them.”

Of course, these were just Chen Cha’s private thoughts. On the surface, he nodded slightly and indicated for Ning Zhuo to continue.

Ning Zhuo said, “There are always casualties during the annual Fire Persimmon Festival, so I designed a mechanical construct that can pick fire persimmons.

“I named it the explosive fire monkey, and the blueprint is almost complete, except for one last thing…”

Chen Cha grew impatient and waved his hand. “Okay, okay. Let me take a look.”

Ning Zhuo took the mechanical monkey out from his storage bag.

Chen Cha was slightly stunned and couldn’t help but exclaim internally.

The explosive fire monkey’s smooth fur was a gorgeous red, drawing Chen Cha’s attention the moment it appeared.

As a cultivator in the Foundation Establishment stage, Chen Cha naturally had divine sense. He immediately unleashed his divine sense to investigate.

A moment later, his eyebrows were about to rise high, but he barely managed to suppress it in time.

“This mechanical monkey isn’t simple!” Although Chen Cha’s design skills weren’t very good, there were no problems with his vision. He immediately noticed that this explosive fire monkey had many special features.

Chen Cha reached out and touched the explosive fire monkey’s smooth and sleek fur, admiring internally: “It’s sewn together so tightly, like one cohesive whole. The fur is lined with talisman runes, making it extraordinarily tough. The craftsmanship is exquisite and meticulous, comparable to an old tailor with many years of experience.”

He wanted to point out some flaws, but couldn’t.

All he could do was lightly say: “This basic fur stitching isn’t bad.”

Ning Zhuo nodded in agreement and said: “Mm, I did it according to the traditional spiritual embroidery method, using the pelts of some fire velvet rats. Since the rat pelts were too small, I could only use threads to sew many of them together. Unfortunately, this means that the heat resistance along the seams is much weaker.”

“Oh, this is your work?” Chen Cha raised his eyes and looked at Ning Zhuo in surprise.

Design skill didn’t equate to crafting skill.

Ning Zhuo was this young, but already so skilled?

“Perhaps this is his specialty,” Chen Cha thought to himself as he continued scanning with his divine sense.

He looked at the mechanical monkey’s skeleton and thought: “Is this sky gold? Sky gold is light, durable, and has certain spatial qualities. Since it’s being used for the skeleton, is it meant to store things?”

He continued looking. Noticing the formation patterns on the bones, Chen Cha thought, “Sure enough, this is a storage formation. It’s arranged well, making full use of the skeleton and compressing the formation’s size to the limit.

“Compressing the formation to this extent requires great skill!

“Thanks to that, this mechanical monkey can still be upgraded. The creator obviously has big future plans.”

Chen Cha gave praise internally. He looked at Ning Zhuo again, then looked back at the mechanical monkey on the table.

There was nothing to criticize about its skeleton.

Chen Cha thought for a moment and said, “Choosing sky gold for the skeleton is just mindlessly following convention, nothing special. As for the minor adjustments to the formation, they’re merely building on the works of the predecessors, which doesn’t count for much.”

Chen Cha was mentally prepared for Ning Zhuo to argue back, but Ning Zhuo just nodded and said, “Actually, my first choice was the hollow snail. I planned on boiling the snail powder and mixing it with iron essence, then molding the mixture into the shape of the bones. This way, the storage capacity would be much greater than it is with sky gold. Unfortunately, hollow snails are hard to get in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.”

Chen Cha was stunned for a moment and thought, “He even knows this stuff?”

Indeed, hollow snails mixed with iron essence would be a perfect complement to the fire velvet rat pelt.

Chen Cha coughed twice, took a deep look at Ning Zhuo, and calmly said: “It’s good that you know.”

Then, he lowered his head and continued to scan with his divine sense.

Looking at the muscles of the mechanical monkey, he guessed internally: “These muscles are made of petroleum mud in order to increase the heat resistance?

“No, it’s different… This should be a new material made with petroleum mud as the base and refined through alchemical processes.

“This… is an original formula? This was actually created by the young man in front of me? What was his name again?

"Ning Zhuo?"

Chen Cha couldn't help but feel a little suspicious.

This Ning Zhuo was too young. Could his alchemy skills really be so incredible?

How difficult was it to create an alchemical formula? Even if it wasn’t a true pill, being able to create a brand-new material was also incredibly rare.

Chen Cha suppressed his doubts and continued his investigation, sighing internally: “Aside from the material, the skill involved in shaping these muscles is also incredible. Just based on this, it’s enough for the crafter to serve as the second hammer in an artifact workshop. For some minor magic artifacts, being the main hammer isn’t impossible either.”

Seeing this, Chen Cha couldn’t help but feel slightly vexed.

This mechanical monkey was more or less perfect. No matter how much he wanted to point out some flaws, he couldn’t even find any.

If he couldn’t find any flaws, how could he expand this business deal?

Many people who came to Chen Cha for consultation ended paid many more spirit stones than they had planned. This was because Chen Cha pointed out many flaws and led them to ask more questions.

Apart from stressing over the high consultation fees, these people had no other complaints.

After all, Chen Cha’s advice was indeed effective.

Chen Cha gritted his teeth and continued scanning.

He opened the monkey’s hand, and his eyes immediately shone brightly.

Sighing internally, he thought: “This hand is exquisitely designed. Micro-formations are nested within each other, allowing the hand to move flexibly and perform complex finger movements.

“This combination is quite novel. The one who arranged these formations is very talented!

“Was this also done by Ning Zhuo?

“Who is he? A young genius from the Ning Clan? How come I’ve never heard of him?”

Chen Cha tried to remain calm as he scanned the mechanical monkey’s skull.

At this point, he finally couldn’t hide it anymore and revealed a hint of surprise.

The magic artifact inside the skull was actually a set of three stroll bullets!

“Stroll bullets are supposed to be offensive artifacts whose trajectory can be controlled at will. But these ones have been modified to fly around each other in the monkey’s brain, acting as receivers for divine sense. I’ve never seen, no, I’ve never even heard of something like this before!

“There are also many talisman runes engraved in the monkey’s skull to link up with them.

“How original! How creative!”

Chen Cha thought about it quickly and knew that this setup would be effective.

“Isn’t this kind of creativity and inspiration precisely what I’m lacking?”

Chen Cha felt slightly sour and couldn’t help asking Ning Zhuo: “How did you come up with this idea?”

Ning Zhuo said: “I had no choice but to turn the stroll bullets into divine sense receivers. After all, this explosive fire monkey is something that needs to make me money. If I equipped each one with a formation disk, the cost would be too high. That’s why I designed it this way.

“However, I’ve always felt that this isn’t an ideal solution. There are still unknown hidden dangers and unstable factors.”

Chen Cha's eyes lit up.

"Cost! Right, without a formation disk, this mechanical construct is extremely cheap to produce.

“Isn’t this exactly what I’m looking for? With this thing’s performance, it will definitely sell like crazy!

"Wait a minute…"

Chen Cha suddenly looked at Ning Zhuo and felt a little angry.

This mechanical construct could be considered flawless. What need was there to come ask him for advice?

What intentions did this young man have?

“Don’t tell me he’s doing this to mock me?”

But after the surge of anger, doubts arose in his heart.

“Such an incredible mechanical construct… was it really designed by this boy in front of me?

“If I were the one who designed something like this at that young of an age, I would have raised my head up high and proudly paraded it everywhere.

“This is an expression of his own ability. It’s not something any ordinary person can compare to!

“But this kid is a bit too humble…

“It’s almost as if he’s feeling guilty about stealing someone else’s work.”
