Chapter 563: The Manifestation of the Dragon’s Graceful Might

As Elder Long openly challenged Du Tiechuan, the entire battlefield fell momentarily silent.

The Thousand Peaks Forest Alliance’s morale, previously on the verge of collapse, subtly shifted.

Simultaneously, the Two Note Kingdom, which had been pressing forward aggressively, slowed their offensive and turned their attention to the core battlefield.

Du Tiechuan, naturally, was not in the commander’s tent. He specialized in military strategy and had long since relocated.

"Hmm?!" From a dark corner, Du Tiechuan's eyes suddenly emitted a sharp gleam, piercing through the surrounding darkness.

Elder Long’s open challenge sparked anger in Du Tiechuan, swiftly replaced by caution and a deep sense of crisis.

“Such confidence, deliberately provoking me - could it be that the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King lies hidden nearby?”

“It’s suspicious that he didn’t act during the earlier defeat! Could he be planning something monumental?”

Du Tiechuan was intimately familiar with such strategies. In their initial confrontation, he’d gained the upper hand against the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King precisely because he’d prepared meticulously and employed the Iron Flow Leveling the Plains military art.

Utilizing that particular strategy required extensive preparations, immense resources, and the establishment of a special command platform.

Fundamentally, it was a method of extreme potency once executed.

Without seeing Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King appear, Du Tiechuan felt immense unease.

"Or perhaps, it's merely a bluff..." Du Tiechuan considered this possibility but ultimately refrained from acting, opting instead for patience and concealment.

Given his current unfavorable condition, being caught off-guard would spell disaster for the overall situation.

In a certain sense, one cannot lose if one does not gamble.

"Now is not yet the time to be forced into action," Du Tiechuan quietly closed his eyes, continuing to hide his presence.

A renowned military commander, a cultivator at the Soul Formation stage, was openly challenged by a mere Nascent Soul stage cultivator yet chose not to respond. This immediately affected the entire battlefield.

"Du Tiechuan didn't respond; perhaps he's in poor condition! Could this battle still turn in our favor?" The Thousand Peaks Alliance noticed this nuance, rapidly regaining their morale.

On the other side, worry began to appear within the ranks of the Two Note Kingdom.

In the cultivation world, it's common knowledge that powerful individuals often determine the outcome of large-scale battles. History books are filled with such examples.

Therefore, the strongest individuals often have the greatest influence on morale.

"The gamble paid off!" Elder Long exhaled deeply. He was keenly aware of Dragon King’s actual movements, so the pressure on him had been immense.

Provoking Du Tiechuan was extremely risky, but since he had succeeded in temporarily deterring him, Elder Long erupted into laughter. "Hahaha…"

His laughter echoed throughout the battlefield, bold and fearless.

He swiftly charged toward the nearest Nascent Soul cultivator.

The targeted Nascent Soul cultivator from the Two Note Kingdom immediately retreated, eyes flickering nervously.

Elder Long shouted fiercely, "Face me directly, coward!"

Divine Ability - Dragon King's Majestic Presence!

This Divine Ability, originating from Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King, combined a dragon's might and prestige, divine authority, and even carried traces of royal decree.

The more fearful and cowardly the target, the more powerful the effect!

Elder Long activated this Divine Ability solely targeting one cultivator, instantly immobilizing the Nascent Soul cultivator attempting to evade.

"This is bad!" the Nascent Soul cultivator paled in fright, further amplifying the restrictive effect of the Dragon King's Majestic Presence.

Like a fierce dragon breaking free into the sea, Elder Long reached the cultivator in an instant, punching through his chest and tearing the body apart.

The exposed Nascent Soul screamed in terror yet remained bound by the Dragon King's Majestic Presence.

Elder Long's eyes flashed divine light, instantly destroying the Nascent Soul.

Without pause, Elder Long lunged towards the next Nascent Soul cultivator.

Repeating his tactic, the second Nascent Soul cultivator's will crumbled, leaving him frozen mid-air.

Shuang Ling and others swiftly reacted, providing assistance.

Protective spells enveloped the Nascent Soul cultivator, while various offensive spells and treasures rushed toward Elder Long.

Yet, Elder Long charged forward relentlessly!

Using his powerful divine dragon body, he forcefully breached the concentrated fire, blood scattering as he arrived directly before his target.

With support, the Nascent Soul cultivator barely regained mobility. "I won't die!" he shouted, unleashing his ultimate techniques against Elder Long.

Elder Long simply extended his hand calmly. "Futile struggle."

The Nascent Soul cultivator's eyes widened. At this moment, Elder Long's palm suddenly expanded in his vision, rapidly growing until it covered the sky and earth.

The massive palm obscured the heavens and earth, and along with it, all his vitality.

Martial Technique - Ambition Seizing Decapitation!

Elder Long and the Nascent Soul cultivator passed each other; when they separated, Elder Long held an additional head in his hand, while the cultivator's headless body spewed blood from its neck, collapsing powerlessly to the ground.

Bang.

Elder Long applied slight force with his right hand, directly crushing the cultivator's head.

He spread his arms, puffing out his chest and lifting his head high as if embracing the heavens, roaring, "Who else dares come to their death?!"

In an instant, he stood like a battle flag, deeply embedded into the hearts of everyone present.

Although Thousand Peaks  Forest was clearly facing complete collapse, their spirits surged at this sight, with many initiating a counterattack.

"Elder Long!!!"

"With Elder Long here, we cannot lose."

"See that? Elder Long can still fight - we can still win!"

Nearby, Lu Hongtu couldn't conceal his astonishment. Elder Long's towering figure reflected clearly in his eyes, causing his heart to tremble uncontrollably. "Turning the tide against all odds! That's exactly what Elder Long is doing!"

The second major battle between the two states, Two Note Kingdom and Thousand Peaks Forest, had now reached its climax.

At this critical juncture, the Thousand Peaks Forest Alliance demonstrated its strengths. General Elder Long, despite the disadvantageous situation of an impending defeat, stepped forward courageously, using both wit and bravery to rally morale and inspire the hearts of his soldiers. Through his solitary efforts, he altered the course of the battle.

In contrast, Du Tiechuan remained hidden, and his acting supervisor Zhao Xi had long been "injured and unconscious," retreating to the sidelines.

Someone from Two Note Kingdom needed to step up!

Someone needed to crush Elder Long's momentum!

"Insolent mountain savage, enough arrogance!" With a crisp rebuke, Shuang Ling soared into the sky.

At this decisive moment, the ingenious Princess of Two Note Kingdom once again stepped forward.

Surrounded by numerous mechanical creations, she formed a mechanical army in the sky, unleashing a barrage of mechanical techniques against Elder Long.

"Good timing!" laughed Elder Long boldly, neither dodging nor evading, charging straight toward Shuang Ling.

Divine Ability - Dragon King's Majesty!

In Shuang Ling's spiritual sea, an umbrella immediately formed, protecting her consciousness.

Martial Technique - Dragon Roar Palm.

Divine Ability - Divine Dragon Body!

Martial Technique - Withered Dragon Claw.

Divine Ability - Vitality Collapse Explosion!

Elder Long aggressively pushed forward, destroying every costly mechanical creation in his path with brute force.

"He can still use Vitality Collapse Explosion again?" Shuang Ling, aware of his abilities from gathered intelligence, was shocked.

This was already the third Vitality Collapse Explosion.

Elder Long's bones fractured with fine cracks, his body swelling like an overinflated balloon, nearing rupture.

Blood erupted from all seven orifices, clouding his vision with a hazy red mist.

Seeing such a desperate and frenzied opponent approaching, Shuang Ling immediately sensed his fatal resolve and madness.

"He has no intention of surviving!" Shuang Ling screamed sharply, choosing to flee.

As a princess, there was no need for her to exchange her life with a mountain barbarian.

At this moment, Elder Long's combat prowess was nearing the Soul Formation level. He charged like a blood-soaked dragon from the depths, easily smashing through mechanical defenses. Golden Core-level mechanical constructs couldn't withstand even one exchange with him.

Elder Long, astonishingly swift, collided into Shuang Ling's back.

In this moment of life and death, Shuang Ling's protective treasure activated, attempting to teleport her through space.

"Don't even think about escaping!" roared Elder Long, unleashing a Divine Ability to freeze a portion of the surrounding space.

"No - !" Shuang Ling shrieked.

If she forcibly moved through space, her body would be torn apart. If she stopped to fight, she risked being directly obliterated by Elder Long.

At the critical juncture of the Princess's life, a sword qi suddenly pierced forth!

The seemingly ordinary sword qi deeply penetrated Elder Long's immense body effortlessly.

Although Elder Long's Sacred Dragon Body provided formidable defense, even spreading the power of Spirit Treasure-grade shoulder armor across his form, the sword qi cut through easily, as if through thin paper.

"Du Tiechuan!" Elder Long turned sharply, eyes blazing with divine light, simultaneously roaring with thunderous force.

The combined force caused the surrounding air to violently explode, forcing a figure to appear.

The figure was tall and lean, with sharp, angular features and blade-like eyebrows. Wearing a silver-threaded crown and grey-green robe beneath silver armor, it was Du Tiechuan!

Elder Long mocked, "A mighty Soul Formation expert sneak-attacking a mere Nascent Soul cultivator? Ha ha ha!"

Expressionless, Du Tiechuan locked a portion of his divine sense onto Elder Long, replying coldly, "All is fair in war - what could a barbarian understand? You've been rampant long enough. It's time to end this."

Du Tiechuan skillfully flicked his wrist, sending multiple sword lights toward Elder Long.

Elder Long fearlessly charged forward, laughing wildly.

Yet Du Tiechuan continued to retreat strategically, maintaining distance. Although Elder Long's strength approached Soul Formation, Du Tiechuan was far from an ordinary expert!

As a general and commander of Two Note Kingdom, Du Tiechuan was supported by elite treasures, armor, and national techniques.

Elder Long could quickly defeat figures like Shuang Ling, but couldn't successfully chase Du Tiechuan, instead falling further behind.

Swish, swish...

Continuous sword lights struck Elder Long, causing hundreds of new wounds in mere breaths.

Many cuts reached bone depth, flooding Elder Long in blood.

Though his vitality was abundant, residual sword qi prevented his wounds from healing.

Elder Long roared repeatedly, deploying countless martial and Divine Abilities, all countered effortlessly by Du Tiechuan.

Using his sword as a core, Du Tiechuan calmly mobilized various artifacts, weaponry, national arts, and strategies, neutralizing every move Elder Long made.

Across the vast battlefield, everyone slowed their pace, closely watching the pivotal battle between Du Tiechuan and Elder Long!

Du Tiechuan fully embodied the mastery of a strategist, never entering battle without meticulous preparation. After secretly observing for a long time, he had thoroughly grasped all of Elder Long's tactics and carefully devised various countermeasures.

Elder Long's strenuous efforts bore no fruit, and his injuries only grew more severe.

His vision, previously painted in bloody hues, was now shrouded by darkening clouds, with darkness creeping into his eyesight.

Simultaneously, an overwhelming fatigue and weakness, originating deep within his bones, overcame him.

At that instant, Elder Long felt a crystal-clear premonition: "Is this... the end?"

In that fleeting moment, an old memory surged up from the depths of his heart.

Within Green Forest Immortal City...

A young Elder Long knelt, desperately begging a physician in a medical hall: "Please, sir! My father is critically ill and near death. Have mercy and save him!"

The physician impatiently snapped back, "Kid, you want me to leave the city and journey deep into Thousand Peaks Forest without any spirit stones? Are you mocking me?"

Hurriedly shaking his head, Elder Long replied, "No, I have spirit stones. I do."

He took out all his possessions, nearly a hundred spirit stones, laying them on the ground to show the physician.

Glancing down, the physician was infuriated by what he saw as an insult: "You penniless brat! Less than a hundred low-grade spirit stones, yet you dare ask me to treat someone?"

He brushed Elder Long aside and began walking away.

Terrified, Elder Long instinctively clung to the physician's leg, begging, "Sir, please show mercy..."

With a violent kick, the physician shouted, "Get lost!"

Struck hard, Elder Long spat blood and fainted immediately.

When he regained consciousness, he found himself abandoned outside the city, his life savings of spirit stones stolen.

Desolate, Elder Long returned to Thousand Peaks Forest, to his tribe.

He wept uncontrollably at the bedside of his fever-ridden father, who remained unconscious.

Just then, a priest from Dragon King Temple visited his home, telling Elder Long, "If you sincerely wish to save your father's life, climb Dragon King's Heavenly Pillar Mountain. With true sincerity, the Dragon King's blessing shall be yours."

Young Elder Long trekked arduously, prostrating himself step-by-step for seven days and nights until, on the verge of reaching the summit, exhaustion overwhelmed him, and fierce mountain winds cast him off a cliff.

Landing on a protruding rock face with no way out, he continued bowing in desperate prayer.

A miracle then occurred.

Vines, like serpents, intertwined into a stairway. Hard rock cracked open, and a ginseng root protruded, willingly falling to him.

Elder Long swiftly picked up the ginseng root and safely descended along the vine stairway.

Back home, just one small bite of the ginseng root brought his father renewed vitality, curing his severe illness and saving his life.

This became the turning point of Elder Long's life, marking his unwavering devotion from then onward.

This memory flickered briefly within his heart, revitalizing Elder Long's spirit and restoring his strength, as if he had returned to his peak.

Yet, deep down, Elder Long knew this surge was merely the final burst of life.

His vision sharpened once more, allowing him to fix his gaze firmly upon Du Tiechuan.

“Two Note Kingdom? Ha!”

“I was born in Thousand Peaks Forest, raised in Thousand Peaks Forest, and have never received even the slightest mercy or charity from the Two Note Kingdom."

"Only our Lord, the Ginseng Dragon King, is the true sovereign of Thousand Peaks Forest - our sole and rightful ruler!”
