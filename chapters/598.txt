Chapter 598: Amnesty and Alliance Policy (Happy Mother’s Day!)

In the prison, the old scholar of the Ink Pool picked up a branding iron.

The front half of the branding iron was glowing red-hot from the charcoal brazier, and at its very tip was an engraved word.

Upon closer inspection, Ning Zhuo saw that it was the word “Benevolence.”

The old scholar of the Ink Pool held this branding iron with the word “Benevolence” and walked up to the Silent Ghost General.

The Silent Ghost General was bound and unable to move, staring calmly at the old scholar.

Without the slightest hesitation, the old scholar pressed the branding iron directly onto the Silent Ghost General’s forehead between his brows.

Sss...

The red-hot iron scorched the Ghost General’s brow, sending up thick black smoke.

For a moment, the scent of burning flesh filled the air.

The old scholar pressed the branding iron down for a full five breaths before slowly withdrawing it and returning it to the brazier.

The Silent Ghost General’s head drooped powerlessly, his breath now rough and heavy.

Seeing Ning Zhuo’s surprise, Wen Ruanyu explained in time, “We Confucian cultivators uphold the Five Constants: Benevolence, Righteousness, Etiquette, Wisdom, and Trust.”

“Benevolence means to love others. It is the foundation of Confucianism.

“If you desire to establish yourself, you must help others establish themselves; if you desire success, you must help others achieve success.

“A person of benevolence has a generous heart, with integrity as steady as a mountain. They bestow favor and offer tolerance, accumulating good deeds as a foundation and treating all things with sincerity…”

Ning Zhuo listened attentively.

Whether it was the old scholar Zheng Shoumo or the Myriad Manifestations true disciple Wen Ruanyu, both were Confucian cultivators.

To Ning Zhuo, Confucian cultivation was unfamiliar, so hearing such detailed explanations from these masters made him perk up and learn eagerly.

Seeing that the Silent Ghost General was only gasping heavily, the old scholar pulled out another branding iron from the brazier.

This time, it bore a different word – “Righteousness”.

Hiss.

Zheng Shoumo pressed the branding iron onto the Silent Ghost General’s left shoulder, creating another wave of scorched flesh.

The sharp pain caused the Silent Ghost General to suddenly raise his head and gaze at the ceiling, but his expression remained indifferent and his eyes calm.

Seeing this, the old scholar grew thoughtful. “Good, that gaze is not bad. I hope you can maintain this resolve for the next ones as well.”

Ning Zhuo: ...

Wen Ruanyu explained again, “Righteousness, or properness, is the anchor of the righteous path."

“A gentleman values righteousness above all and builds his conduct upon it."

“Righteousness does not lie in the body but in the heart. Even in times of adversity, one must uphold one’s integrity and not betray one’s original will…"

“To act with righteousness is to follow justice, unmoved by personal gain; to embody uprightness with no distractions in the heart.”

Ning Zhuo silently committed these words to memory.

The old scholar set down the Righteousness branding iron and took out a third one, bearing the word “Etiquette”.

He repeated the process, branding the word onto the Silent Ghost General’s left shoulder blade. The Ghost General tightly shut his lips and clenched his teeth, still refusing to utter a sound.

The old scholar examined him from head to toe, sincerely praising, “As expected, a true man of steel.”

Wen Ruanyu once more offered an explanation for Ning Zhuo, “Etiquette, or civility, is the code of conduct that humans must follow.

“It’s said that etiquette is order, the structure of heaven and earth and the foundation of a state.

“Further, etiquette is the respect in one’s heart and the method by which one interacts with the world. To act with etiquette is to hold reverence in the heart, be graceful in manner, and retain a measure in all things…”

Wen Ruanyu seemed to have studied this aspect the most deeply.

He even added some of his own understanding: “Etiquette is not hypocrisy, but the unity of internal respect and external expression in accordance with natural law and human morals. Knowing when to advance and when to retreat, judging weight and lightness, discerning right and wrong…”

Ning Zhuo gained much from this and hastily cupped his hands in thanks.

He recalled the earlier scene at the Nether Flood-Dragon River when Wen Ruanyu engaged in battle. His mastery of etiquette had indeed been profound, causing many water ghosts and underworld soldiers to lay down their weapons and begin speaking of manners, surrendering themselves.

“Benevolence, Righteousness, Etiquette, Wisdom, Trust... with Benevolence, Righteousness, and Etiquette already branded, only Wisdom and Trust remain.”

Ning Zhuo recognized the pattern and had already noticed that many branding irons were stuck in the brazier, just with their tips buried too deep to see the words on them.

The old scholar returned the branding iron to the brazier but did not immediately take out the fourth one.

He turned to Wen Ruanyu and said, “Sir Wen, this enemy commander is truly the toughest man I’ve encountered in my life. I’ve branded him with three words, and he hasn’t so much as furrowed his brow or groaned in pain. I fear the remaining two words won’t get him to talk either.

“I am ashamed.

“I was boasting just a moment ago, but now I’m eating my words.

“It was my mistake to underestimate the heroes of the world.”

Wen Ruanyu frowned, “Then what now?”

The old scholar replied, “I still have a method. We can use this man’s fortitude to extract even more intelligence.”

Moments later, the Green-Faced Ghost General, Bone Club Ghost General, Flower Life Ghost General, and Fang Tooth Ghost General were all brought into the cell.

The old scholar said, “Your commander truly is a tough man. He didn’t let out a single sound even after being branded with three words.

“Watch closely. I hope you all can show the same resolve!”

With that, the old scholar pulled out the branding iron with the word Wisdom and pressed it hard onto the Silent Ghost General’s thigh.

The Silent Ghost General trembled from the pain but still uttered nothing.

Seeing this, the faces of the other four Ghost Generals changed drastically. Some struggled desperately, letting out muffled cries, but they were tightly bound and couldn’t move freely.

Wen Ruanyu once again explained to Ning Zhuo, this time through divine sense, “The wise are those who have knowledge and can put into practice that knowledge. Theirs is the wisdom of penetrating insight.

“Knowing is not as good as liking, and liking is not as good as enjoying…"

“A wise person sees clearly, adapts to change, perceives the subtle, understands the big picture, is thoughtful in planning and decisive in action…

Ning Zhuo silently nodded, pleased at all he was learning.

Even the old scholar couldn’t help but give the Silent Ghost General a thumbs up. “Very good. You’re the toughest prisoner I’ve seen in my entire life.

“I’ve never encountered someone who could endure all five words. I hope you can break that record.”

Hiss.

In the next moment, the branding iron with the character Trust was also pressed onto the Silent Ghost General’s right thigh, searing the word onto his flesh.

Wen Ruanyu said, “Trust is ethos, the virtue of keeping one’s word and staying loyal.

“To speak and act as promised, to honor one’s commitments, unwavering in loyalty, winning the hearts of all, and thereby embodying true virtue.

“A gentleman focuses on the root, and once the root is established, the path emerges. Virtue is never alone; it always finds companions. Trust brings peace of mind to the people. A nation that is trustworthy wins the hearts of its citizens. It is both a moral pinnacle and the foundation of personal integrity.”

As he finished explaining, the Silent Ghost General finally reached his limit. His eyes closed, and he fainted on the spot.

“What a pity, what a pity.” The old scholar shook his head in sincere regret.

He turned and unbound the Green-Faced Ghost General, allowing him to speak.

With a gentle and refined tone, the old scholar said, “I recall that you once received a branding, but fainted halfway through the first word. I hope you’ll do better this time.”

The Green-Faced Ghost General, a hardened veteran of countless battles and a ghostly creature who licked blood from his blade, struggled even more violently at these words, shouting, “I already told you everything! I’ve confessed all I know!”

The old Confucian scholar of the Ink Pool nodded and smiled. "In a moment, we’ll summon Madam City Lord’s Soul Inquiry Scroll. I hope your words are true."

The old scholar resealed the bindings on the Green-Faced Ghost General, then successively released the restraints on the remaining three generals so they could speak.

The three generals had all witnessed with their own eyes how Silent Ghost General had collapsed in unconsciousness, and they had each experienced the pain of the branding iron. This kind of pain was not merely skin-deep but reached into the depths of the soul, a truly soul-searing, unbearable agony.

This time, when the old scholar interrogated them one by one, they all confessed military intelligence they had previously withheld. Their attitudes became considerably more proper.

Only when it came to Flower Life Ghost General did this ghost general stammer out tremblingly, "Sirs, Sir Silent didn’t truly resist to the end. He had long desired to return to the light. It’s just that his innate talent and cultivation technique made his expression remain calm and prevented him from speaking."

The old scholar of the Ink Pool: ......

Ning Zhuo and Wen Ruanyu: ......

The silence grew a little awkward.

With a wave of his hand, Mo Chi ordered the remaining four generals to be taken away.

He cupped his hands toward Wen Ruanyu, requesting permission to cast a spell.

Wen Ruanyu did not hesitate and nodded in approval.

Thus, in the next instant, Mo Chi activated a Confucian spell - Amnesty and Alliance Policy.

The old scholar stirred his spiritual energy, rapidly depleting it as he chanted softly under his breath, like reciting a beautiful literary piece.

Hand seals, oral seals, and heart seals - these were the main method through which spells were cast.

For a Confucian cultivator, oral seals were especially crucial.

As Mo Chi chanted, one by one, tiny silver-white words condensed from thin air and gathered together to form a refined and elegant passage of writing.

These silver-white words flowed like water toward Silent Ghost General.

The five branded words on Silent Ghost General’s body were infused with the silver-white writing and began to emit a gentle white glow.

The glow rapidly spread from the five origins, converging across the surface of the Ghost General’s body into crisscrossing lines.

Upon closer inspection, each silver-white line was formed by minuscule words joined together. From a broader view, these lines looked like tightly bound restraints completely binding Silent Ghost General.

The silver glow gradually faded until nothing remained.

After more than ten breaths passed, the silver lines themselves also disappeared without a trace.

Finally, the five branded characters - Benevolence, Righteousness, Etiquette, Wisdom, and Trust - also faded away completely. To the naked eye, there was no difference from before.

"Good. A complete success. Not bad at all." Wen Ruanyu clapped his hands and praised, "Old Brother Zheng’s insights into the Amnesty and Alliance Policy far surpass mine. If I had cast it, I certainly would not have achieved this level of effectiveness."

Ning Zhuo was slightly surprised. "Elder Zheng is in the late Foundation Establishment stage, while Senior Wen is a Golden Core stage cultivator. This can still happen?"

Wen Ruanyu nodded. "Of course it can. Throughout the long river of history, we Confucian cultivators are late bloomers. The reason we managed to rise and secure a share of the world is because our cultivation method incorporates the hundred arts of cultivation.

"For example, there are the traditional four scholarly arts - zither, chess, calligraphy, and painting - as well as the six gentlemanly disciplines of rites, music, archery, charioteering, writing, and arithmetic. These allow us to cross stages of cultivation.

"It is precisely because we blend these cultivation skills that Confucian cultivators are not judged solely by cultivation base. Sometimes, a Confucian cultivator deeply versed in the arts or classical texts can do things even those with a high cultivation base cannot."

Ning Zhuo thought of his own experience of using military strategy in battle to suddenly amplify his combat power, and he gained deeper understanding.

The Silent Ghost General slowly regained consciousness, his expression still as indifferent as ever.

The old scholar of the Ink Pool directly released his bindings and restored his freedom.

This was a bold move, yet Wen Ruanyu showed no intention of stopping it.

As the Silent Ghost General studied the three of them, silver-white radiance shimmered on his body. He half-knelt on the ground and bowed to the three, expressing submission with the most direct action.

Seeing this, Sun Lingtong could not help exclaiming, "This Amnesty and Alliance Policy is too effective, isn’t it? It’s about on par with your Life-Hanging Thread divine ability, Little Zhuo.

"But divine abilities are incredibly hard to control. Whereas Amnesty and Alliance Policy is just a Confucian spell. Even an old man like this can learn it!"

Ning Zhuo, however, had a different opinion and privately replied, "There is still a difference.

"My divine ability can forcibly control the enemy’s body and movements regardless of their will, and it works instantaneously."

"But the Amnesty and Alliance Policy requires extensive preliminary setup. Cultivating this spell must also have its own difficulties. Otherwise, Wen Ruanyu, a true disciple in the Golden Core stage, wouldn’t have deferred to a Foundation Establishment cultivator like Zheng Shoumo.

"I really am growing more interested in Confucian cultivation. I hope to find time to learn more about it in the future."

Sun Lingtong laughed, "Little Zhuo, is there any school or technique you’re not interested in?"

Ning Zhuo paused and replied, "Learning more is never a bad thing."

Through this experience, the two of them expanded their horizons and realized that Confucian cultivators were quite different from what they had imagined.

The Silent Ghost General had been won over, but the other four generals couldn’t endure the branding. They could only be branded one word at a time with intervals in between. Thus, even though the Flower Life Ghost General had expressed their willingness to surrender, they were still imprisoned.

When Wen Ruanyu and the others questioned the Silent Ghost General, they did not gain any valuable leads.

In response, the old scholar of the Ink Pool analyzed, "Since they were sent into the inner city on a death mission, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord wouldn’t have entrusted them with important intelligence.

"In that sense, the Golden Core Ghost Generals dispatched here must have not been considered very valuable.

"And precisely because of this, it is more likely that we can persuade them to surrender."

As for the Silent Ghost General, Ning Zhuo secretly felt it was a pity.

He had hoped to burn him and extract the spirituality of his innate talent.

However, since he had already surrendered, his value to White Paper Immortal City was naturally greater for the time being.

"Right now, the ghost tide is still assaulting the city. A major battle is inevitable.

"I’ll let Silent Ghost General continue making contributions. Once he eventually dies on the battlefield, I can take over then. There’s no need to rush."

With no further leads, Ning Zhuo decisively suspended the investigation and remained in the Hidden Yang Residence to focus on cultivation.

He used the four soul cultivation treasures one after another, causing his soul foundation to soar with each use.

He broke through from Ten Thousand Man Soul to Hundred Thousand Man Soul, and then kept advancing from Hundred Thousand Man Soul without the slightest decrease in speed.

On another front, Ning Zhuo also maintained his cultivation in the Three Schools Supreme Skills. Unfortunately, his progress in the Demonic Blood Vein Technique remained slow.

Ning Zhuo had the aptitude, and with the support of his Early Wisdom innate talent, his comprehension of Demonic Blood Vein Technique was already far beyond that of ordinary cultivators.

But comparison was the thief of joy.

From his perspective, his progress in understanding the Demonic Blood Vein Technique was simply too slow. It couldn’t compare at all to the cultivation of his physical body, and even his physical cultivation lagged far behind his soul cultivation.

"Jiao Ma, Jiao Ma, your family has come to visit you." When Ning Zhuo’s soul foundation reached Three Hundred Thousand Man Soul, he received a message from a paper puppet servant.

The visitor was the head of the Jiao Clan. Upon seeing Ning Zhuo, he immediately launched into a scolding tirade: "Ma'er, what are you doing? You still haven’t entered the Robust Yang Courtyard and are staying in Hidden Yang Residence?

"Speak up!

"Are you still hung up on Qing Yan’s daughter?"
