Chapter 407: Three Thousand Peach Blossoms, A Farewell Feast:

At Great Contention Peak, Ten Thousand Demons Cave.

"Haha, my dear brother has arrived!" Linghu Jiu laughed heartily as he walked out of the cave entrance, grabbing Ning Zhuo's arm and leading him inside.

After the negotiations, the Myriad Medicine Sect, Ning family, Zhu family, and Linglong Mirror Wall had formed a secret alliance, which had brought Linghu Jiu and Ning Zhuo much closer.

Linghu Jiu already had a good impression of Ning Zhuo, and now with their alliance ties strengthened, he treated the latter completely as one of his own.

As Ning Zhuo entered the cave, he found Lin Shanshan was also present.

"Lady Lin." He hurriedly bowed.

Lin Shanshan also smiled at Ning Zhuo. Although she had some misgivings about Ning Zhuo's recent actions, after Linghu Jiu's invitation, she knew this was a farewell feast for Ning Zhuo, so she attended with mixed feelings.

The dishes at the feast were very exquisite, all personally selected by Lin Shanshan.

However, Linghu Jiu and Ning Zhuo's minds were elsewhere.

Linghu Jiu brought over a wine jar and excitedly showed it to Ning Zhuo: "This is wine I personally brewed using water from the Peach Blossom Pool."

"Peach Blossom Pool?" Only after asking did Ning Zhuo learn that this deep pool was near the Ten Thousand Demon Cave, beneath the waterfall.

Lin Shanshan explained: "Every year during the appointed season, the upstream peach forests bloom. The peach blossoms fall in the wind, following the water flow and waterfall, finally gathering in the deep pool. The peach blossoms and pool water reflect each other, creating a scene of scattered petals dancing in the wind, thousands of red and purple hues entering the water. The white waterfall flows like the sound of a zither, the flowered surface of the jade pool reflecting the emptiness."

Ning Zhuo smiled at Lin Shanshan: "Today I learn that the deep pool where I first met Lady Lin is called Peach Blossom Pool."

This made Lin Shanshan pause, her thoughts seemingly returning to the scene of her first meeting with Ning Zhuo.

Time flows like water, so many days had passed!

Time went by too fast.

In the blink of an eye, they were about to part.

Suddenly, a feeling of reluctance to part swept through Lin Shanshan's heart, instantly dissolving her resentment toward Ning Zhuo.

Meanwhile, Linghu Jiu began pouring wine while proudly introducing: "Let me tell you, brother, this wine is called Three Thousand Peach Blossoms."

"It's made from peach blossom petals collected during the spring equinox, along with spring water from beneath Peach Blossom Pool, plus my special yeast. Using ancient brewing methods, it takes at least three years of fermentation to achieve even minimal success."

Ning Zhuo looked carefully and saw that the Three Thousand Peach Blossoms wine was crystal clear with a slight pink tinge, like newly blooming peach blossoms. When poured into the wine bowl, the liquid was clear, creating slight ripples that resembled the deep peach blossom pool itself.

He raised his wine bowl, clinked with Linghu Jiu and Lin Shanshan, and took a sip, immediately sensing something unique.

Three Thousand Peach Blossoms brought a distinctive sweetness, as if biting into a fresh peach blossom, with a gentle floral fragrance amid the sweetness.

Then, the wine spread across his tongue, full and mellow, with a hint of the cool pool water's sensation, leaving an endless aftertaste.

Ning Zhuo shook his head slightly and immediately praised: "Excellent wine! The flavor is delicate and long-lasting, having both the mellowness of aged wine while maintaining the fresh, elegant floral fragrance. The strength is moderate, making me unconsciously intoxicated."

Linghu Jiu laughed: "The wine itself is ordinary, but I added something special to make it presentable."

A light flickered in Ning Zhuo's mind, and he blurted out: "Could it be the Ten Thousand Year Water Essence?"

Linghu Jiu clapped and laughed heartily: "My clever brother, you got it in one!"

Ning Zhuo was speechless.

Previously, he had borrowed two portions of Ten Thousand Year Water Essence from the Myriad Medicine Sect, and had been wondering where Linghu Jiu's portion had gone.

As the head disciple and first candidate to become the next sect leader, it was very strange that Linghu Jiu hadn't produced his portion of the Ten Thousand Year Water Essence, which was extremely valuable to the entire Myriad Medicine Sect.

It turned out he had used it to brew wine!

Lin Shanshan snorted: "Wine, wine, wine, all you think about is drinking wine. Do you know how disappointed I am in you, Big Senior Brother, about this matter!"

Linghu Jiu rubbed his nose and chuckled, saying: "Shanshan, you don't understand. Do you know why Master named me Linghu Jiu? He had foresight and naturally knew wine's importance to me, so he deliberately gave me this hint."

"Haha, Master didn't force me to hand over the Ten Thousand Year Water Essence, which means he approved of my choice. Whatever else you say won't change anything."

This made Lin Shanshan roll her eyes dramatically.

Ning Zhuo quickly raised his wine bowl, clinked with both of them, and said a few amusing words to ease the atmosphere.

After they had been drinking for a while, Ning Zhuo looked at Linghu Jiu and Lin Shanshan with sincere eyes and sighed: "Brother Linghu is like a deep pool, noble and upright, accepting the waterfall without overflowing, deep and steady â€“ he is my drinking companion."

"Lady Lin's beauty is like blooming peach blossoms, gorgeous and moving, and she is helpful with a kind heart. In the past, my reckless actions in kidnapping Lady Lin and constantly opposing your respected father were truly shameful."

Lin Shanshan snorted: "Hearing these words, at least you still have some conscience."

Linghu Jiu laughed heartily: "Each serves their own master, struggling for benefits is common. Fighting without breaking, competing amicably, ending up with this secret alliance is already the best outcome. This is our destiny, and also the result of our individual efforts."

Hearing this, Ning Zhuo felt even more moved.

He knew very clearly that during the difficult negotiations at the Linglong Mirror Wall, while Linghu Jiu protected his own interests, he also did his utmost to help Ning Zhuo, building relationships and persuading Lin Bufan many times.

In contrast, Lin Shanshan, the lady who had helped Ning Zhuo so much in the past, was like a sharp sword during the negotiations, constantly attacking Ning Zhuo.

Under the watchful eyes of the various sage incarnations, in front of Zhu Xuanji, Shen Lingshu, and Lin Bufan, Ning Zhuo didn't dare use the Life-Hanging-By-A-Thread technique.

But he completely understood Lin Shanshan.

Fortunately, the outcome was good.

Now that the negotiations had concluded, the relationship between Myriad Medicine Sect and the Ning family was unprecedentedly close, and Ning Zhuo's relationships with Lin Shanshan and Linghu Jiu had also secured a very high bottom line.

"Come, let's drink!" Ning Zhuo raised his wine bowl again.

Linghu Jiu laughed heartily.

Lin Shanshan remained silent but raised her wine bowl in response.

The three drank wine and discussed the future.

Ning Zhuo asked Linghu Jiu about his experiences killing demons in the Linglong Mirror Wall.

These past few days, Linghu Jiu was still "confined" in the Ten Thousand Demon Cave, but his true body would secretly enter the quasi-immortal artifact to engage in life-and-death battles with various demon beasts.

Linghu Jiu was very enthusiastic in discussing this, speaking of the dangers of battle but also how it greatly tempered him, allowing him to clearly feel his combat power increasing step by step. Previously he was like rough stone, now being polished. Under great external pressure, various spells, sword techniques, and other skills were heavily compressed, producing many insights, eliminating many unnecessary moves, making his battle rhythm increasingly clear and quick.

"It's a pity you have other urgent matters and must leave. Otherwise, fighting demons shoulder to shoulder and drinking together afterward would surely be one of life's greatest pleasures!"

Ning Zhuo was quite moved by these words, and just imagining it made him smile, sighing: "If there's time in the future, I must train together with you, brother. Just thinking about it now makes me feel exhilarated!"

Linghu Jiu laughed heartily and drank three large bowls with Ning Zhuo.

Lin Shanshan: ......

At this moment, she suddenly felt somewhat superfluous.

Linghu Jiu's face turned red, breathing wine-scented breath as he grabbed Ning Zhuo's arm: "Brother, before you leave, you must leave your projection."

"In the future when I miss you, I can chat with your projection, which will help ease my longing."

"Moreover, I can take your projection with me to kill more enemies and demons. When you return to the valley, perhaps the bounty will be so rich it will greatly surprise you, haha!"

Ning Zhuo nodded repeatedly: "I was thinking the same thing!"

Lin Shanshan: "However, Big Senior Brother, it seems you won't be staying in the valley much longer either. I heard Master mention in passing that he wants you to personally lead a team to Fire Persimmon Immortal City to scout the battlefield in advance."

Linghu Jiu's smile diminished slightly as he sat back down. Looking at the two of them, he nodded and said: "Master did indeed mention this idea to me."

The real reason Linghu Jiu was always punished with confinement by Lin Bufan was that Lin Bufan wanted to use this to infiltrate the Linglong Mirror Wall. Additionally, by punishing the head disciple for protecting his junior disciples, it would help build Linghu Jiu's reputation and win people's hearts.

Now, Linghu Jiu knew the truth, and Lin Bufan had deeply realized that the quasi-immortal artifact was not something he or his sect alone could covet.

Moreover, in the alliance agreement, Ning Zhuo had already negotiated conditions with Lin Bufan, successfully inviting Lin Bufan to assist at Fire Persimmon Immortal City!

That's right.

In the coming days, Lin Bufan would actively prepare for battle, helping Ning Jufan and his Ape exert force in the struggle for the Ten Thousand Year Fire Essence.

As for the Ape's injuries, she had been taken over by the royal Zhu family, who were doing their utmost to heal her quickly.

Linghu Jiu said solemnly: "This battle requires the utmost caution. If handled improperly and the Great Ape of the Ning family falls, then the Ning family and royal family's control over Fire Persimmon Immortal City and Magma Immortal Palace would be greatly weakened."

After the alliance, the Myriad Medicine Sect side had gained a true understanding of the situation in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

But it still wasn't complete.

Ning Zhuo's preservation of the Dragon Fire Spirit remained a secret, even Ning Jufan didn't know about it.

Regarding the secret that Ning Zhuo possessed the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, Zhu Xuanji also actively kept this secret, with only a limited number of people including the Lord of the Southern Bean Kingdom knowing about it.

"I have decided to go to Fire Persimmon Immortal City," Linghu Jiu said. "Brother, what advice do you have for me?"

Ning Zhuo smiled slightly, already prepared. He handed over a jade slip containing detailed information about Fire Persimmon Immortal City and Magma Immortal Palace.

Linghu Jiu's divine consciousness entered it and found much clearer information, especially regarding the understanding of Magma Immortal Palace, which was very thorough. He was greatly pleased.

"With this jade slip, my battlefield reconnaissance is already half successful. Thank you, brother!"

Ning Zhuo quickly waved his hand and spoke several humble phrases.

He turned to look at Lin Shanshan, requesting her help in looking after the Spirit Concealment Willow, saying he would periodically send letters and asking Lin Shanshan to reply with updates about the Spirit Concealment Willow's condition.

Lin Shanshan nodded in agreement.

Ning Zhuo observed her mood and, seeing it was good, pressed further: "That Hua Guzi specializes in wood-element techniques. I intend to arrange for her to stay here, partly to represent me in looking after Spirit Concealment Willow, and partly to assist my clan members in successfully settling at Little Contention Peak."

Lin Shanshan immediately frowned.

"Hua Guzi?" She didn't have much fondness for this crazy woman.

Ning Zhuo showed a slightly embarrassed expression: "This female cultivator has an odd temperament and is extremely... attached to me, wanting to depend on me. If I don't give her something to do, I'm afraid she'll search for me all over the world."

"Moreover, her strength is considerable, not just her combat power, but she's also skilled in cooking."

"Oh, it was actually from consulting with her that I learned the Profound Thought Brew was fake wine."

At this point, Linghu Jiu immediately spoke up to defend his master: "Brother, your words are mistaken. Profound Thought Brew absolutely cannot be called fake wine."

"It has a unique taste and is indeed fine wine, just that the recipe isn't outstanding."

"It truly helped me communicate more easily with the sage incarnations in the Linglong Mirror Wall. Didn't you also benefit from this before, Brother Ning?"

Ning Zhuo had no intention of arguing with Linghu Jiu about this, so he immediately raised his wine bowl: "I spoke wrongly, I'll punish myself with a drink!"

Lin Shanshan showed a smile and said through gritted teeth: "Indeed you should be punished."

Linghu Jiu laughed heartily, pointing at Ning Zhuo: "Is this punishment or reward?"

Thus, the farewell feast concluded with both hosts and guest thoroughly enjoying themselves.
