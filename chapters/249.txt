Chapter 249: After Years of Struggle, Finally Arriving Here!

This is a world of orange-red hues.

The air is hot, and even standing still, one would naturally break into a sweat.

Ning Zhuo tidied up his bedding.

After setting up some talismans around the room, he pushed open the door and stepped out of his temporary residence.

Together with members of the three reformation teams, he entered the Lava Immortal Palace, bringing ample supplies for a long-term stay.

Ning Zhuo left the house allocated to him.

In the small courtyard, several cultivators from the Ning family were cleaning.

Upon seeing Ning Zhuo, they all greeted him with respect and admiration.

Through his hard work over the past months and various actions, Ning Zhuo's prestige within the Ning family reformation team had reached its peak.

Ning Zhuo smiled at them, nodded, and then, with seemingly slow but actually swift steps, left the camp.

According to recent orders, he needed to head to a secluded area to meet Zhu Xuanji.

As he walked, he looked up slightly, gazing into the sky.

The sky was covered by a massive spherical light shield, glowing a faint golden color.

From Ning Zhuo's perspective, he could vaguely see beyond the shield: a dense, endless tide of demon beasts.

Various types and sizes of demon beasts were frantically attacking the formation shield of the Lava Immortal Palace.

The shield was not absolutely secure.

In some places, where the attacks reached their limit, cracks appeared.

Through these visible cracks, flames seeped in.

Immediately, the flames reformed in mid-air, creating a Void Traversing Technique-level Fire Snake.

The Fire Snake hissed as it fell, but before it could hit the ground, a large group of mechanical constructs met it in mid-air, engaging in battle.

By the time the Fire Snake hit the ground, it had suffered significant damage, barely clinging to life.

Then, it was completely overwhelmed by more mechanical constructs on the ground.

Such scenes did not reassure Ning Zhuo.

On the contrary, he had already sensed the declining defensive power of the Lava Immortal Palace.

His recent bombardment had provoked an enormous tide of demon beasts! The Lava Immortal Palace was at a disadvantage, and the situation was worsening over time.

"Brother Sun's entry into the Immortal Palace is highly risky. I wonder how he managed to get in." "Did he rely on the Golden Core true disciple Yang Chanyu of the Void Sect again?" Thinking of Yang Chanyu, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but feel more worried.

Previously, when Sun Lingtong went to steal goods from the Cloud Merchant, he once again teamed up with Yang Chanyu.

Yang Chanyu's repeated assistance was quite troubling in Ning Zhuo's eyes.

He raised his estimation of the price Sun Lingtong would have to pay.

"Next, I need to find an opportunity to secretly meet with Brother Sun and hand over the Supreme Virtuous Water!" "Then see if I can subtly inquire from Yang Chanyu about the specific price Brother Sun has to pay for this cooperation." "That Seven-Colored Auspicious Cloud, Brother Sun is unwilling to give it to Yang Chanyu. I'll use it as a gift to see if I can get some information from her, and secretly help Brother Sun bear some pressure." Walking through the streets of the Lava Immortal Palace, Ning Zhuo was gradually drawn in by the scenery along the way, putting aside his thoughts.

This was his first time truly walking within the Lava Immortal Palace.

Countless times, he had imagined this scene in his plans...

Today, it was finally realized! In the Lava Immortal Palace, everywhere he looked, there were golden pillars and red bricks.

Under the firelight reflected by the surrounding magma, the golden pillars and red bricks shimmered with a dazzling glow, like an eternal immortal light.

Towering towers, majestic halls, and exquisite side halls were all laid out clearly and reasonably.

The solid architectural structure gave the Lava Immortal Palace a robust and ancient feel.

The statues of fire dragons and fire phoenixes were intricately carved and lifelike, adding a sense of grandeur.

Although the two architectural styles were contrasting, they blended harmoniously here.

Ahead of Ning Zhuo, a wall gradually appeared.

The wall was quite thick, and at intervals, large talisman patterns were drawn on it, resembling painted windows. "This is the Spirit-Hiding Wall," Ning Zhuo thought.

He reached out his hand, walking while touching the uneven wall.

The tactile sensation transmitted to his fingertips was so clear.

This was a profound feeling he hadn't experienced when his soul entered the Immortal Palace!

His eyes gradually reddened, and he couldn't help but think of his deceased mother. "Mother, I have finally reached the Lava Immortal Palace at this moment." Ning Zhuo had longed for this moment for over a decade, planning for it for just as long.

Once he decided to bomb the Immortal Palace and took action, there was no turning back.

Reaching this point was not easy for him.

He had exhausted his mind and energy, faced numerous life-and-death crises, and only then could he walk this path.

With only Qi Refining Stage cultivation, he had to navigate among the four major forces of Fire Persimmon Immortal City, enduring the immense pressure brought by Zhu Xuanji.

During this time, he used various means to survive each crisis.

Sometimes, he relied on over a decade of preparation, and sometimes he depended on luck.

In this process, any slight mistake could lead to his death without a burial place! Many who explored the Immortal Palace only began to fight for their lives when facing the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts.

But Ning Zhuo had already placed his life on the line from the very beginning. "If possible, I wouldn't want to do this," Ning Zhuo once again looked at the faint golden spherical shield in the sky.

He watched the dense tide of demon beasts outside the shield: "I have no choice, forced by circumstances, I had to overturn the table."

Of course, he controlled the intensity, not completely overturning the table.

This time, he used the demon beasts to create a situation where everyone had to give their all.

In this way, he could alleviate much of the pressure on him.

Once Ning Zhuo achieved this step, the entire situation became irreversible.

For the Lava Immortal Palace and for him, it was the same!

He was like a fledgling bird on the edge of a cliff, spreading its wings for the first time, either soaring to the sky or falling to the ground.

Following the wide street, Ning Zhuo finally arrived at a side hall. "Here." The people inside the side hall turned their heads upon hearing the knock on the door.

Zhu Xuanji spoke, "Come in."

The next moment, Ning Zhuo pushed open the door and entered.

The side hall was already occupied, and Ning Zhuo was the last to arrive.

Besides Zhu Xuanji, there were Zheng Jian, Zhou Zeshen, and Zhou Zhu. "Divine Constable," the white-clad youth Ning Zhuo first saluted Zhu Xuanji, then apologized to the others, "Sorry, I'm late." The geniuses from the Zhou and Zheng families all smiled at him.

"We haven't been here long." "You're not late; the timing is just right." By now, Ning Zhuo had not only gained immense prestige within the Ning family but also earned the admiration of the genius cultivators from the other two families through his actions and achievements.

Even the Golden Core Stage Zhu Xuanji regarded Ning Zhuo with newfound respect.

Ning Zhuo discreetly glanced at the heads of the three genius cultivators.

He noticed that during their time apart, the Life Hanging by a Threads above their heads had grown thicker and more solid. "It seems their recognition of me is deepening." Ning Zhuo looked at Zhu Xuanji and sighed inwardly, "If only I could plant the Life Hanging by a Thread on his head, my advantage would be significant." Unfortunately, with his current cultivation, even possessing the complete Life Hanging by a Thread Divine Ability, he couldn't achieve that.

"Perhaps, when I advance to the Foundation Establishment Stage, I might be able to plant the Life Hanging by a Thread on a Golden Core cultivator's head," Ning Zhuo speculated.

Zhu Xuanji was straightforward: "Now that everyone is here, let's sign the contract first." He briefly explained the contract's contents.

Zheng Jian and Zhou Zhu had no objections, but Zhou Zeshen and Ning Zhuo both frowned slightly.

Zhou Zeshen was doubtful but didn't dare to question directly, so he looked at Ning Zhuo.

As expected, Ning Zhuo cupped his hands, "Divine Constable, please wait a moment, I have some concerns." "If it's just to restrain our three families and the City Lord's reformation team members... this indeed achieves fairness, allowing us to focus all our energy and time on competing for various positions in the Lava Immortal Palace."

"But besides our four parties' reformation team members, many others are also soul-entering the Immortal Palace, competing for its treasures." "What about these people?" "What if a buried genius emerges among them, quickly rising due to this inheritance, and ultimately surpassing our achievements? What should we do then?" "If our four parties' reformation team members can't soul-enter the Immortal Palace, wouldn't that leave an opportunity for such individuals?"

"So I believe we should at least leave some people to monitor the trials in the Lava Immortal Palace, to prevent such dark horses from appearing." Zhu Xuanji nodded slightly, "We've already considered these situations." As he spoke, he took out a scroll.

Clearly, it was a decree scroll.

Zhu Xuanji handed it to Ning Zhuo first.

Ning Zhuo unfolded it and found that the decree scroll contained extensive content.

The text detailed the various terms of the four-party contract, perfectly addressing Ning Zhuo's concerns.

Each party would send a reformation team member to station at the trial checkpoints in the Lava Immortal Palace, recording and monitoring the exploration of the Lava Immortal Palace by the city's residents.

If a dark horse appeared, the four forces would promptly intervene.

The decree scroll also specified the contract's duration and how to handle various unexpected situations that might arise during the period.
