Chapter 389: Go Wild, Carbon! The Five Elements Realm!

The Five Elements Lord changed forms continuously, displaying various manifestations of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth before Ning Zhuo's eyes.

Green wood, red fire, yellow earth, white metal, black water.

Wood had the three-legged golden crow perching on the Fusang village, the sky-reaching Jianmu tree, the life-extending Ruotao, and the phoenix-resting Wutong tree...

Fire had the intense South Ming Lifire, the inextinguishable Samadhi True Fire, the civilizing Liaoren Fire, the karmic Red Lotus Karma Fire, the alchemical treasure Eight Trigrams Furnace Fire...

Earth had the endless Xirang soil, the heaven-mending five-colored stone, the eternally fertile Houtu, the sacred Kuncang earth...

Metal had the supreme forging Kunlun metal, the royal authority Xuanyuan metal, the otherworldly power of star-fallen iron...

Water had the all-engulfing Ruoshui, the star-studded Celestial River, the clear Jingwei water, the life-extending Penglai Immortal Spring...

These various treasures were the essence and limits of the Five Elements, representing the principles of each element.

Because so many principles were gathered, some cultivators who witnessed these objects generated true understanding in their spirit seas, comprehending the corresponding principles. Of course, this was strongly related to the cultivator's enlightenment ability.

Ning Zhuo observed the various Five Elements treasures, quickly mastering the manifestations of the Five Elements. His Five Elements realm thus advanced to the ordinary level of great accomplishment.

The Five Elements Lord's transformations continued.

This round, he no longer manifested the physical forms of the Five Elements treasures, but various conceptual and virtual images.

The white radiance of the metal element sometimes appeared like the edge of a sword, the blade of a knife, piercing, chopping, cutting, and slicing.

Ning Zhuo understood from this that the nature of metal was hardness, governing execution.

The green light of the wood element spread like vines, grew like grass leaves, from tiny to robust, then to greatness.

Ning Zhuo realized that the nature of wood was growth, representing development and vitality.

The ink-like flow of the water element sometimes transformed into towering waves wanting to engulf everything, sometimes spread out calmly without ripples, sometimes became a babbling brook, and sometimes a still pond.

Ning Zhuo gained some understanding that the nature of water was compliance, governing change, able to overcome hardness with softness.

The flame strands of the fire element transformed into lamp fire, seemingly soft and small, yet still able to burn moths. They became raging fires, spreading fiercely, and became radiance, illuminating all directions.

Ning Zhuo then understood that the nature of fire was intensity, it was light, it was heat, it was moving forward without looking back.

The yellow light of the earth element solidified into blocks, stone blocks piled up to become mountains. Mountains collapsed, turning into a vast expanse of land, boundless and profound.

Ning Zhuo then realized the nature of earth was heaviness. It bore everything, being the foundation of all things.

Ning Zhuo's seven apertures slowly oozed blood.

The characteristics and personalities of the Five Elements allowed him to directly advance his Five Elements realm from the ordinary level to the master level!

His mastery of the Five Elements became more profound.

The Five Elements Lord laughed heartily, pointing at Ning Zhuo: "Kid, you've comprehended to this extent, your enlightenment ability is not bad. You're one who knows how to use your brain. You can continue watching."

He continued to transform, more thoroughly demonstrating the principles of the Five Elements to Ning Zhuo.

The white light of the metal element transformed into a pill, full and firm, indestructible as a diamond.

Ning Zhuo's heart was moved: "So the nature of metal is not only killing, but also killing oneself, eliminating one's impurities and foreign matters one by one, constantly refining to oneness. Therefore, the nature of metal is killing, but also stopping, it is gathering."

The green light of the wood element evolved from a grass sprout into a big tree, and the big tree instantly shed leaves, withered, and decayed.

Ning Zhuo comprehended the true meaning: "So the nature of wood is life on the surface, but death inside. It is precisely because of death that life exists. With life, there is death. The cycle of life and death is like the sprouting and decay of wood, this is birth and destruction, reincarnation and impermanence."

The black river flowed quietly, the flora along its banks flourished, countless beasts came to drink, and people along the way dwelled and multiplied.

Ning Zhuo understood: "The nature of water is inclusiveness, it is compassion for all beings, it is non-action and non-contention, yet it is omnipresent."

This time, the red firelight burned into human form, the light of wisdom forming concentric circles one after another.

Ning Zhuo knew: "The nature of fire is not only fierce destruction, but also burning one's own heart, burning away the troubles and desires in the heart, illuminating the path of wisdom, guiding oneself and others. So the nature of fire is awakening, enlightenment."

The yellow earth chunks cracked into countless pebbles, the pebbles rolled down from the mountain, merging one by one into the ground, being trampled, worn away, but eventually still part of the earth.

Ning Zhuo felt: "The nature of earth is not only bearing, but also the final destination. No matter how high the stones fly, they will eventually fall to the ground. Profound virtue bears all things, bearing all things deepens virtue. Being originally part of the foundation, everything naturally returns to the foundation. The so-called bearing is also burying!"

At this point, Ning Zhuo deeply reached the inner foundation of the Five Elements, grasping the essential principles.

His Five Elements realm was elevated to the level of grandmaster!

From now on, following these inner foundations and essential principles, he could create spells and techniques corresponding to each element.

Ning Zhuo's head was empty, his stomach growling, his physical and mental energy completely drained.

He had no strength left!

The Five Elements Lord was surprised, clicking his tongue: "Strange, how close is this Spirit Concealing Willow to you? Did you plant and nurture it from small to large yourself?"

"It still wants to sacrifice itself for you!"

"Kid, it seems your destiny doesn't end here. Continue watching, haha."

The Lord laughed loudly and continued his demonstrations.

But this time, he no longer demonstrated each element separately, but merged and combined metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.

Ning Zhuo's pupils were already dilated, his face blank.

Various principles were unreasonably poured into the depths of his heart, like a flood cascading.

Wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal, metal generates water, water generates wood.

The Five Elements are mutually generative. All things in the universe can support and promote each other, life, the universe, and fate are continuously connected.

Therefore, the Five Elements are endless!

Wood overcomes earth, earth overcomes water, water overcomes fire, fire overcomes metal, metal overcomes wood.

The Five Elements are mutually restrictive. Among all things in the universe, if any aspect expands excessively, it will be restrained and regulated by the power of another aspect.

Therefore, the Five Elements are stable and balanced!

The Five Elements are classified separately, yet the Five Elements are also a whole. The myriad things are complex and vast, yet all things are a whole.

Ning Zhuo felt his whole body burning hot, as if on fire, his head about to explode, unable to think!

The Five Elements Lord also showed surprise and delight: "Kid, so you have dual talents. Besides early wisdom, you also have another..."

"So that's it!"

He seemed to have discerned Ning Zhuo's talent, his expression becoming somewhat strange: "Heaven gave you this talent, does it want you to walk an unorthodox path?"

"Interesting."

The Five Elements Lord's expression became complex. He looked up at the sky, sneering: "Well done, Heaven and Earth! Still resenting me for privately controlling the Five Elements? Even when I want to find a successor, I can't."

"Having the talent, able to catch my eye, yet I can't be his master!"

"Fine, fine, fine. Inheritance comes first, it doesn't matter if I can't be the master."

Saying this, the Five Elements Lord's eyes flashed with divine light, staring intently at Ning Zhuo, saying sternly: "Kid, remember, I am not your master! I was just demonstrating the principles of the Five Elements, not guiding you. You accidentally stole this knowledge."

Ning Zhuo was already mentally exhausted, his spirit depleted, completely unable to hear clearly what the Five Elements Lord was saying, but his left arm began to burn hot.

The Five Elements Lord's face showed solemnity: "Next is the profound principle of my created 'Five Organs Temple Divine Art'."

"Heaven has Five Elements, so does man!"

"Metal, wood, water, fire, earth; liver, lung, kidney, heart, spleen; anger, sorrow, fear, joy, worry!"

"The Five Elements rotate, the Five Organs flourish and decline, thus can regulate nature, all things transform and use, the Five Elements enter the body..."

When the Five Elements Lord created this divine technique, he directly advanced to become an unsurpassed grandmaster.

Unprecedented in the past, with successors in the future. Even if he were still alive today, he couldn't be called "unsurpassed", but he had reached an extremely profound and subtle level.

Ning Zhuo listened and felt as if his soul was about to leave his body.

Each sentence, each word of the Five Elements Lord turned into the primal sound of heaven and earth. This sound was both big and small, extremely contradictory.

What Ning Zhuo could understand was vast and boundless, what he couldn't understand became so faint it was nearly inaudible.

He was like a lone boat, tossing and turning in a stormy tsunami, dizzy and disoriented.

The Spirit Concealing Willow finally couldn't hold on, not a leaf left on the tree, as if not yet a dried corpse, dim and lifeless, with barely any vitality.

Ning Zhuo relied entirely on his mysterious talent and the Spirit Concealing Willow's boost.

After a great force, he suddenly spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, the lone boat in the tsunami finally fell apart, directly smashed and sunk by the huge waves.

Some time passed, and Ning Zhuo slowly opened his eyes.

His head was splitting with pain, his vision a blur of white, unclear, only able to see vague human shapes.

Although the face was unclear, Ning Zhuo recognized Sun Lingtong at a glance.

He was too familiar with Sun Lingtong.

Sun Lingtong had been guarding by the bedside, seeing Ning Zhuo open his eyes, she clapped her hands joyfully: "Great, Little Zhuo, you're finally awake!"

"I went to check on you after you entered the spirit plant cabin and took too long, unexpectedly finding you collapsed unconscious."

"I used the medical cabin of the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon to stabilize your life force. You've been in a coma for three days and three nights."

"What on earth happened to you?"

Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly: "The opportunity was too great, I couldn't digest it all, almost died from overeating."

Sun Lingtong: ?!

Ning Zhuo, in a weak voice, explained the details to Sun Lingtong.

Sun Lingtong scratched her head: "The Five Elements Lord took a liking to you? Wanted to make you his successor across generations! No wonder the Spirit Concealing Willow looks like it's dying."

"What? Boss, what did you say happened to the Spirit Concealing Willow?" Ning Zhuo jolted, wanting to sit up.

But Sun Lingtong was quick, directly pressing him down with one hand.

"Lie down properly."

"Your condition is still not good, you need to rest."

"This is bad news, don't get too excited... The Spirit Concealing Willow is dying."

Ning Zhuo struggled, very anxious: "Boss, the Spirit Concealing Willow is an important inheritance treasure, we can't let anything happen to it."

"Quick, help me go see it!"

Sun Lingtong couldn't stop Ning Zhuo, so she had to help him up and walk to the spirit plant cabin again.

Ning Zhuo circulated his energy, digesting the medicine's power, his vision becoming a bit clearer.

"This is bad!" Seeing the Spirit Concealing Willow, his heart instantly sank to the bottom.
