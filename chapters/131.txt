Chapter 131: The Death of the Spirit

Outside Fire Persimmon Mountain.

A demon beast, as large as a mountain, opened its bloodthirsty maw.

A powerful suction force immediately emerged, attempting to swallow the cultivators in front of it in one gulp.

At the critical moment, a ruler radiating sunlight-like brilliance descended like a meteor.

Slash!

The demon beast died miserably on the spot.

Zhu Xuanji descended from the sky.

The rescued cultivators recognized Zhu Xuanji's identity and hurriedly kowtowed, expressing their endless gratitude.

Zhu Xuanji glanced at them and looked towards Fire Persimmon Immortal City: "During this period, it's best for you to stay away from the Immortal City. Go now." The cultivators saw Zhu Xuanji's serious expression and dared not cling to him, retreating obediently.

Some of them heeded Zhu Xuanji's advice, while others had important matters and still returned to the Immortal City.

These movements naturally did not escape Zhu Xuanji's notice.

He did not persuade them further, his mood heavy.

After probing for a day or two, he was certain that this was Meng Kui's doing, who had secretly used the Sitting Mountain Divine Ability, forming a fate energy field centered around himself.

The fate energy field covered the entire Fire Persimmon Mountain, including the Lava Immortal Palace and Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

Moreover, the range of the fate energy field was still expanding, forcing Zhu Xuanji to repeatedly move outward.

The demon beasts encompassed by it became irritable and battle-hungry, causing countless bloody conflicts due to various accidents or trivial matters.

The more Zhu Xuanji saw, the colder his heart grew.

"Meng Kui..."

Meng Kui sat in the depths of the clouds and mist, coldly observing the turbulent external world.

His main focus had always been the Lava Immortal Palace!

And the offensive and defensive battle at the top of Fire Persimmon Mountain had been ongoing for several days.

Various Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts continuously assaulted the Immortal Palace, while the numerous mechanisms and constructs within the palace formed a solid defense line.

Suddenly, Meng Kui's eyes moved slightly.

At the edge of the Immortal Palace's defense line, a figure suddenly appeared, moving at an extremely fast speed, aiming to enter the palace.

Nearby demon beasts noticed and attacked the mysterious person en masse.

In the next moment, the mysterious person erupted with Golden Core qi, unleashing a chilling frost that froze and killed a large number of demon beasts, successfully entering the Immortal Palace.

The various mechanisms and constructs within the palace showed no intention of attacking the mysterious person.

"Oh, the Ice Heart Technique... It's a Golden Core from the Ning family," Meng Kui recognized.

The Zhou and Zheng families' four Golden Core cultivators had already entered the formation for a gambling duel, while the Ning family's Golden Core Patriarch took the opportunity to infiltrate the Lava Immortal Palace.

Meng Kui sneered coldly, "The Ning family's Golden Core cultivator possesses profound knowledge in mechanism techniques, allowing him to infiltrate the Immortal Palace. This is something we had never discovered before." "According to the Ning family, they only discovered the Lava Immortal Palace this year." "Is this statement true?"

It is possible that the Ning family's Golden Core Patriarch enhanced his mechanism techniques this year, reaching the standard required to enter the palace. 

Alternatively, he might have secretly infiltrated the palace long ago, with the Ning family's outward claims being nothing but a smokescreen.

"Could he be that Shadow Demon Cultivator?" Meng Kui quietly observed the Ning family's Patriarch, continuously playing with two walnuts in his hand. 

The walnuts rubbed and rotated against each other in his palm, occasionally flashing with complex runes on their surfaces.

New intelligence reached Ning Zhuo's hands.

"Someone outside Fire Persimmon Mountain was being chased by a demon beast and was saved by Zhu Xuanji?" "Zhu Xuanji is outside the city?"

Ning Zhuo's expression turned grave. 

This information greatly challenged his previous assumptions.

He had originally thought that the person who trapped Sun Lingtong was Zhu Xuanji.

After all, Zhu Xuanji had publicly questioned Sun Lingtong before, only to be temporarily dismissed by the latter's tantrum.

"In fact, this is indeed not Zhu Xuanji's style."

"If it really isn't him, then who could cause such a big trouble for Sun Lingtong?"

Ning Zhuo had lived here for sixteen years and was well-acquainted with all the important figures and forces in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

Sun Lingtong, being at the peak of Foundation Establishment and having controlled the black market for many years, had very few people or forces capable of dealing with him in such a manner!

"Han Ming?"

Once his thoughts opened up, Ning Zhuo immediately thought of the female demon cultivator he had captured.

This possibility indeed existed!

Ever since Ning Zhuo publicly displayed some of his strength, he no longer had the same freedom of movement as before.

After the three-family test, he hadn't seen Han Ming again.

Even when he replenished Yuan Dasheng's spirit, it was through controlling the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.

"At that time, I did hear Han Ming's call from the dungeon..."

Ning Zhuo was now similarly constrained in his movements.

"Should I send Yuan Dasheng to take a look?"

Ning Zhuo immediately dismissed this idea.

The matter concerning Bao Qiu had already spread widely.

This group was about to make a move!

At this critical juncture, if Ning Zhuo were to send Yuan Dasheng away and miss the opportunity to protect Yuan Er, what would he do?

"It seems like there are two choices, but in reality, there's only one."

Ning Zhuo calmly analyzed, "If Han Ming was truly rescued, causing Boss Sun to fall into a predicament, then they likely made arrangements at the dungeon." "If I send Yuan Dasheng over, it will definitely alert the enemy!" "This matter is not urgent to act upon."

Ning Zhuo chose to remain still, constantly keeping an eye on Yuan Dasheng.

The assassination attempt by Bao Qiu's group happened much earlier than Ning Zhuo had anticipated.

Night descended, the moon and stars sparse.

Through the lurking Yuan Dasheng, Ning Zhuo quickly discovered Bao Qiu's group moving through the Monkey Head Gang's base.

Yuan Er was cowering at the very center of the gang's headquarters.

However, the defenses and guards around him were constantly being pulled away by elders who had developed ulterior motives, creating many significant gaps.

Guided by insiders, Bao Qiu and his group smoothly reached the outside of Yuan Er's residence without alerting any guards.

It wasn't until someone climbed through the window, triggering a talisman, that the activated spell alerted Yuan Er.

"Help! Help! Assassins, assassins!" Yuan Er shouted, frantically activating the formation inside the house.

The formation lasted only a few breaths before being destroyed by Bao Qiu's group.

Clearly, the traitor's influence had reached the core areas.

"Father, Mother, your child avenges you today!!" Bao Qiu, upon being discovered, roared towards the sky and charged in first.

The group behind him followed without hesitation.

Yuan Er still had several close attendants and servants by his side, who formed a defensive line to fend off the assassins.

Bao Qiu and his group were extremely well-prepared, breaking through the defense after only a brief delay and reaching Yuan Er.

Yuan Er resisted while trying to escape.

"Useless." Ning Zhuo observed coldly.

Yuan Er was already panicking, losing his composure.

His escape completely disrupted their defensive arrangements, further shaking the morale of the close attendants.

Yuan Dasheng had long been eager to act.

Ning Zhuo silently called out in his heart, "Go."

The Tree Martial Ape Dasheng roared, leaping out to block Bao Qiu.

Yuan Er was overjoyed, "Uncle Monkey!"

Yuan Dasheng's combat prowess was extraordinary.

After a few rounds, he had Bao Qiu retreating step by step.

Several vengeful cultivators tried to bypass Yuan Dasheng, only to be ruthlessly slain by him as he moved to intercept!

By the time the Monkey Head Gang members arrived, Yuan Dasheng had already finished the battle.

Most of the cultivators were dead, though Bao Qiu survived with severe injuries.

Yuan Er stood tall and proud, walking up to Bao Qiu.

Bao Qiu was forcibly held down by the gang members, unable to do anything but kneel.

"Your father couldn't beat my father, so he was killed."

"Now, you can't beat me either. It's only natural for you to be killed."

"Heh, who gave you the courage to think you could kill me?" Yuan Er felt confident once again.

This confidence stemmed from the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng standing behind him!

Most of the onlookers occasionally glanced at Yuan Dasheng.

In the recent assassination battle, Yuan Dasheng had fully demonstrated his strength and bravery.

Bao Qiu and his heavily armed men couldn't gain any advantage and were utterly defeated by Yuan Dasheng.

Bao Qiu looked up, his face covered in blood and hatred.

"Ptui!" He spat, but the spit was blocked by a guard.

Yuan Er was very cautious, standing behind the guard, at least four people away, and taunting Bao Qiu excitedly.

Ning Zhuo was also delighted.

In this battle, he felt that the connection between him and Yuan Dasheng had become at least half clear.

"One more assassination attempt, and this hidden danger should be completely eliminated." However, Bao Qiu suddenly froze, his expression turning strange.

The next moment, he roared ferociously, "If not now, then when?!" Everyone else was puzzled.

The guard closest to Yuan Er suddenly acted, drawing his blade and turning around.

The blade flashed like snow, swift as lightning!

Yuan Er's head flew off on the spot.

This scene stunned almost everyone.

Yuan Er's head fell to the ground, and in his final moments, he looked at the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng.

Yuan Er was puzzled, why didn't Uncle Monkey save him?

He had forgotten: his Uncle Monkey was no longer a being of flesh and blood, but a mechanical creation, a soulless mechanical creation.

This wasn't like before, when he faced a life-and-death crisis, and Yuan Dasheng had ample time to react and make a grand entrance to fight.

The guard's attack just now was too fast.

Yuan Dasheng's spirituality needed a process of stimulation; it didn't have time to react.

Ning Zhuo reacted, "There's still hope!"

This was a world of cultivation; even if one's head was cut off, it wasn't impossible to save a life.

However, just as he was about to fully control Yuan Dasheng to retrieve Yuan Er's head and attempt to save him, Yuan Dasheng roared angrily and lost control once again!

It roared like a lion or tiger, furiously charging at the assassin.

The guard raised his blade to block, but Yuan Dasheng's fist smashed down, killing both the man and the blade on the spot!

The surrounding gang members scattered in all directions.

Bao Qiu regained his freedom and tried to escape, but in the next moment, he was grabbed by the head by Yuan Dasheng.

"Don't, don't kill me!" Bang.

A slight popping sound.

Yuan Dasheng directly crushed his head.

But that wasn't enough!

Next, Yuan Dasheng continued to violently assault the bodies of all the assassins.

Only after smashing them into a pulp did he slowly stop.

"Not good!" Ning Zhuo had a terrible premonition.

The green light in the mechanical eyes quickly dissipated, and Yuan Dasheng stood still in place, surrounded by a mess of bone fragments and flesh, head drooping, shoulders slumped, motionless.

No matter how Ning Zhuo tried to sense it, he couldn't feel its spirituality anymore.

A dead silence.

More accurately, it was as if it had never existed.
