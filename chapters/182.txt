Chapter 182: Ning Xiaohui, What Have You Done?!

Boom!

Flames soared into the sky as a violent explosion shattered several puppets rushing forward into pieces.

"Something's wrong! Everyone, be careful," Ning Zhuo shouted, warning the others.

"Did we really eliminate the Mechanical Apes?" Zhou Zeshen frowned deeply.

The next moment, the door before them was pushed open, and three Mechanical Apes, all resembling the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng, entered in single file.

"How can there be so many?"

"Is it because we have a large group, so the Lava Immortal Palace increased the difficulty?" "But this is too much, isn't it?"

Before the group could react, the three Mechanical Apes launched their attack.

"Change formation, use the battle array!" Zhu Xuanji commanded in a low voice.

The Zhou family cultivators stepped forward, forming a human wall to block the three Mechanical Apes.

However, before they could activate the battle array, another violent explosion occurred.

Amidst the flames and smoke, the Zhou family cultivators were covered in dust and ashes, but the casualties were minimal.

Their battle array greatly increased their defensive power, making them much more resilient than fighting individually.

However, taking advantage of the explosion, the remaining two Mechanical Apes had already charged to the rear line.

The rear cultivators were thrown into chaos.

Their coordination was no match for the Zhou family cultivators, and more critically, the middle of the team was filled with mechanical constructs.

Boom!

Another violent explosion.

The explosion directly destroyed over twenty mechanical constructs, rendering the previous efforts to create them useless.

The remaining Mechanical Ape rampaged through the crowd, causing everyone to retreat in fear of being blown up.

For a moment, the cultivators' formation was in disarray.

In the critical moment, Ning Zhuo stepped forward: "Everyone, move aside, let me handle this!" The crowd quickly made way, and Ning Zhuo, wielding a giant axe, charged forward.

The giant axe was larger than his entire puppet body.

Ning Zhuo swung the axe with great momentum, creating a fierce wind.

Floating around him were various floating hands, continuously casting spells, bombarding the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.

According to their secret rehearsal, the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng moved nimbly, dodging the spells with great agility, then charged at Ning Zhuo, delivering a powerful push.

Ning Zhuo quickly raised his giant axe to block the attack, but he was still sent flying.

The Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng was about to pursue when Zhou Zhu blocked its path.

After a few rounds, Zhou Zhu was also knocked down.

But at this moment, Zhou Zeshen, Zheng Jian, and Ning Xiaohui surrounded the ape.

Relying on the full strength of the genius cultivators, the three families barely managed to stabilize the situation.

"This is the real Mechanical Ape, the others are simple constructs meant to self-destruct!" In the midst of the fierce battle, a cultivator inspected the battlefield and discovered the truth, quickly shouting to inform the others.

Everyone's hearts sank.

They had been deceived!

They had wasted a large amount of resources, creating eight crossbow carts that were now useless.

"We're ready, lure it in quickly!" The Zhou family battle array was fully activated, exerting its maximum power.

Each member of the Zhou family in the formation bore the heavy burden of maintaining and operating the living array.

Zhou Zhu and the others fought while retreating.

Yuan Dasheng did not pursue, instead focusing on destroying the mechanical constructs.

Seeing that Yuan Dasheng was not falling for the trap, the crowd grew increasingly anxious.

"Damn it!"

"This guy has become too cunning."

Ning Zhuo said, "It's probably the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit controlling it!"

These words immediately infuriated the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, causing it to spew a mouthful of red fire in anger.

"Indeed, it's controlled by a spirit."

"No wonder spiritual treasures can guard families, sects, and nations." The combined forces of the three families immediately became more vigilant, facing the situation with full strength.

The crowd surrounded and blocked the ape, with many even sacrificing themselves to delay the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng for a few breaths.

Ning Zhuo fought fiercely while assisting Yuan Dasheng.

During special training, he understood the power of the Zhou family's battle array.

If Yuan Dasheng got trapped, it would be difficult to escape.

At that time, the various mechanical constructs prepared for him would be unleashed, and Yuan Dasheng would be doomed!

"Cheng Bai, join the battle!" Ning Zhuo secretly controlled the Life Hanging by a Thread, ordering Cheng Bai.

Cheng Bai pushed open the door and rushed into the battlefield, causing a collective gasp from the crowd.

"It's here!"

"The slave ghost puppet has appeared."

"Quick, follow the plan and contain it!"

Zhou Zhu took the lead, wielding the Mud Gate Earth Hammer, charging at Cheng Bai.

Zheng Jian temporarily used his bow and arrow components, shooting arrows at Cheng Bai's face before Zhou Zhu arrived.

But Cheng Bai merely lowered his head slightly, using his hat-like head to deflect the arrows.

Sparks flew as the arrows slid off the curved surface of his head, flying into the air.

Zheng Jian's pupils contracted in surprise.

According to the information, the slave ghost puppet's defense shouldn't be this strong.

"Its materials have been upgraded!"

"Not just it, but also the Mechanical Apes."

Zheng Jian turned his head, observing for a moment before confirming that Yuan Dasheng, though seemingly the same as the information, had undergone many material upgrades.

"Damn it, the Lava Immortal Palace has indeed increased the difficulty!"

In the original plan, Zheng Jian and Zhou Zhu were to engage in close combat to entangle Cheng Bai.

But now, with Cheng Bai significantly enhanced, Zheng Jian's confidence wavered, feeling that the original battle plan was flawed.

"Don't panic! I'll handle it!" Ning Zhuo shouted.

He donned the mechanical constructs he had created.

Two breaths later, he was equipped with modified hanging rings on his neck, wrists, ankles, and other parts.

Ning Zhuo, wielding the giant axe, charged at Yuan Dasheng.

During the fight, the hanging rings on Ning Zhuo's body continuously sprayed threads, attaching to the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.

Yuan Dasheng's movements slowed significantly, giving others an opportunity.

The Zhou family's battle array finally managed to trap Yuan Dasheng.

"Good job, Ning Zhuo!" Zheng Jian praised.

The Grasp Fire Technique further enhanced, bathing it in crimson flames.

"Hehe, Brother Ning, you are indeed reliable at critical moments," Zhou Zeshen transmitted his voice.

Yuan Dasheng roared, casting a spell for the first timeâ€”Grasp Fire Technique.

The flames burned, incinerating Ning Zhuo's threads.

Yuan Dasheng continued to roar, opening the door again, this time releasing a large number of Mechanical Wind Fire Wheels.

The Wind Fire Wheels moved at high speed, spewing flames as they rolled, with great power.

Many puppet bodies were burned to ashes.

The three families' cultivators were tormented by the Wind Fire Wheels, retreating step by step.

"Why are these wheels so agile?" Many cultivators cast spells, repeatedly missing their targets.

The Mechanical Wind Fire Wheels were more agile than anyone had imagined.

"How could they not be agile? I cremated them one by one, gaining their spirituality. They will all shine brilliantly in this battle," Ning Zhuo thought.

"We can't hold on!"

"The casualties are severe."

"Use the smoke carts!!" Some people loudly requested.

"No, those are prepared for the puppet's ghost army." Ning Zhuo immediately refused.

The fierce battle continued.

The Wind Fire Wheels rampaged, burning puppets one after another.

The casualties reached forty percent.

"Use the smoke carts, they can block these wheels!" Someone suggested again.

"No, if we use them, and the opponent releases ghosts, we won't have effective means to deal with them." Ning Zhuo refused again.

The casualties reached sixty percent.

"Ah!" A cultivator shouted, finally unable to bear it, about to activate the smoke carts.

But Ning Zhuo, with quick reflexes, stopped him: "Endure, endure! Small impatience spoils great plans!"

Before long, Yuan Dasheng broke through the Zhou family's battle array, about to escape.

"Where do you think you're going!" Ning Xie finally couldn't bear it, launching an attack.

"Senior Ning Xie, I'll assist you." Ning Xiaohui unleashed the Ice Jade Hand.

Ning Xie cast Snow Soul Ice Essence!

The two joined forces, unleashing peak Foundation Establishment level power.

The temperature dropped sharply, and ice crystals formed, quickly turning the entire room white.

Yuan Dasheng was heavily targeted, struggling to move.

The flames on its body fought hard against the extreme cold and ice.

"Let me deliver the final blow!" Ning Zhuo shouted, leaping high into the air.

He raised the giant axe above his head and then swung it down fiercely!

However, just as everyone watched with anticipation, Ning Xiaohui inexplicably changed the direction of her spell, enveloping Ning Zhuo as well.

Ice quickly formed on Ning Zhuo, freezing him solid.

Bang.

The next moment, Yuan Dasheng attacked, piercing Ning Zhuo's chest.

Then, it lifted its leg, sweeping Ning Zhuo's upper body, including his head, far away.

"Ning Xiaohui!" Ning Zhuo roared in extreme anger.

The crowd was shocked and furious, many unable to comprehend what had just happened.

With the enemy at hand, someone had taken personal revenge so blatantly.

"Ning Xiaohui, you disgrace the main family!" Ning Chen shouted.

Ning Yong roared, "Ning Xiaohui, what are you doing? Without Brother Zhuo, how can we deal with the Mechanical Apes?" Ning Xiaohui was stunned: "I, I did this?" She didn't know why she had done it.

In her daze, she exposed a huge flaw.

Three Mechanical Wind Fire Wheels came from three directions, crushing and colliding with her, shattering her body.

Without a host, Ning Xie roared in anger, about to be expelled from the Lava Immortal Palace.

But the next moment, Cheng Bai arrived, pointing a finger, releasing a group of mechanical ropes from his sleeve.

The mechanical ropes, like a swarm of snakes, bound Ning Xie tightly.

"Someone save me!" Ning Xie became powerless, his face changing dramatically.

The next moment, Cheng Bai arrived, standing before him.

The array and spells activated simultaneously, forcibly suppressing Ning Xie!

The battle continued for another tea's time.

Yuan Dasheng and Cheng Bai were both severely wounded, narrowly achieving victory.

The combined forces of the three families were defeated!

After the battle, countless people exited the Immortal Palace, glaring at Ning Xiaohui with intense hostility, their resentment like a volcano about to erupt.

Ning Xiaohui's face was ashen, and she quickly distanced herself from the crowd.

Many people stepped forward to comfort Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo's face was ironclad: "So close to success, so close!"

"This wasn't your fault."

"Cheer up, Brother Zhuo! You performed the best."

"Ning Zhuo, this time I'm on your side. Ning Xiaohui must give us all an explanation!"
