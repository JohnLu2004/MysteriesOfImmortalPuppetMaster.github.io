Chapter 215: It's All the City Lord's Mansion's Doing!

Zheng Shuangjun: "If the Immortal Palace hadn't emerged, our three families would have explored it in secret, and we were also prepared to accept the Ning family. The City Lord's Mansion deliberately destroyed this great situation, which makes no sense at all."

Zhou Nongying's eyes were deep: "No, it's not like that."

"Previously, when we were exploring the Immortal Palace, the City Lord's Mansion was at a clear disadvantage. Meng Kui couldn't enter the Immortal Palace, and his right-hand men, Chi Han and Fei Si, were also incapable. They didn't have an advantage at the Golden Core Stage. It was only at the Qi Refining Stage where their mechanical cultivators had an edge. In fact, the ones who had the upper hand before were your Zheng family!"

"With the explosion of the Immortal Palace, its defenses were greatly reduced, and the standards for recruiting cultivators were lowered to the Qi Refining Stage. At this level, the City Lord's Mansion had talents with immortal potential!"

"After the explosion of the Lava Immortal Palace, Meng Kui personally took action, stationed himself in the depths of the volcanic clouds, and sealed off the volcano's peak. From then on, we were all isolated and could no longer enter the Immortal Palace to explore." The Golden Core cultivators listened to this and fell into deep thought.

What Zhou Nongying said was true.

From this perspective, the explosion of the Immortal Palace was entirely beneficial to the City Lord's Mansion.

Zhou Nongying continued: "The explosion of the Immortal Palace and the appearance of the Transmission Bell and trial checkpoints might have been unexpected for the City Lord's Mansion. But the fact is: now, on the path of soul entry into the Immortal Palace, Meng Chong and the City Lord's Mansion's reformation team firmly occupy the top ten positions on the ranking list! Perhaps the soul entry route was part of the City Lord's Mansion's plan all along. After all, the City Lord's Mansion discovered the Lava Immortal Palace years before us."

"If the Demonic Blood Vein Technique truly fell into their hands, it further proves that they know many secrets we don't!" Zheng Shuangjun couldn't help but clench his fists in anger: "The old thief is insidious!"

"The Shadow Demon Cultivator was actually from the City Lord's Mansion! I even took the initiative to apologize to the City Lord's Mansion once for my poor guard duty. Meng Hou didn't blame me much at the time, and I admired his magnanimity. Now it seems so ironic!" Zhou Nongying sighed: "Since Meng took office, have our three families had an easy time?"

"He is one of the four generals of the Meng family, known for his wisdom. In terms of scheming and manipulation, we are no match for him." Zheng Danlian struck his fist: "That makes sense!"

"The City Lord's Mansion had long planned to blow up the Immortal Palace and had been preparing for it for a long time."

"They had already prepared for future investigations and defenses. At this time, Ning Zhuo coincidentally brought out the Mechanical Ape. Chen Cha reported this to Fei Si, who might have had a sudden inspiration to use Ning Zhuo and the Mechanical Fire Monkey."

"He secretly instructed Chen Cha to sell the Mechanical Fire Monkeys on a large scale in the market. This way, when the divine constable used the Tracing Origin Technique to investigate the real culprit, they would face countless clues, wasting endless time and energy. If Lord Zhu eventually discovered Ning Zhuo, Ning Zhuo was also from the Ning family. This way, they could also throw mud on the Ning family." Ning Jiufan snorted coldly: "This is Fei Si's style; he has always been so cunning and vicious!"

Zheng Danlian continued to analyze: "Using Fire Essence to blow up the Immortal Palace also has its benefits."

"With the methods of the City Lord's Mansion, secretly purchasing Fire Essence on a large scale from the market and erasing the purchase records is a piece of cake. In fact, they don't even need to do this. They harvest Fire Persimmons every year, which are another form of Fire Essence."

"They only need to manipulate the storage losses of the annual Fire Persimmon harvest to obtain a batch of Fire Persimmons. With a little processing, they can get a large amount of Fire Essence. If they operate this way, we have no way to trace it!" Zheng Shuangjun had been pondering and now showed a puzzled expression: "Wait. There's one thing I don't understand."

"If the Lava Immortal Palace was blown up by the City Lord's Mansion, why did the Shadow Demon Cultivator reappear in Fire Persimmon Immortal City and get chased by Chi Han? He could have retreated after accomplishing his mission, so why go through the trouble?" Zheng Danlian fell silent, unable to understand this point either.

At this moment, Zhou Nongying laughed and said: "I understand! This is the brilliance of the City Lord's Mansion's plan!"

"Under Meng Kui's rule, the appearance of a Shadow Demon Cultivator in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, who then blew up the Immortal Palace, was detrimental to Meng's reputation. It was a blemish on his record. At the same time, the Shadow Demon Cultivator was the most obvious clue and would inevitably be investigated by the divine constable division in the future. So the City Lord's Mansion arranged for the Shadow Demon Cultivator to reappear after blowing up the Immortal Palace and confront Chi Han publicly."

"Chi Han chased him into the Fire Persimmon Forest, showcasing the City Lord's Mansion's capabilities and highlighting our Zheng Shuangjun's incompetence. It also created the impression in the public's mind that the Shadow Demon Cultivator was opposing the City Lord's Mansion. We didn't know that this was all a play arranged by the City Lord's Mansion!"

"Chi Han wanted to chase into the Fire Persimmon Forest and fight the Shadow Demon Cultivator but was stopped by Fei Si."

"After that, Fei Si secretly released the Shadow Demon Cultivator. He controlled the formations in the Fire Persimmon Forest, making it extremely easy for him. As for whether Chi Han knew about it, I am familiar with his personality and tend to believe he didn't."

"If he knew this secret, it would be hard for him to hide it, and his demeanor would give it away. So I boldly speculate that this conspiracy was led by Fei Si." Ning Jiufan also figured it out and continued: "It was because Fei Si released the Shadow Demon Cultivator in advance that we couldn't find him in the Fire Persimmon Forest. Even if we dug three feet deep, we found no trace of him."

"Throughout the process, Lord Zhu Xuanji used his Heaven-Piercing Eye to investigate. There's no reason such a method couldn't find a Shadow Demon Cultivator."

"This incident left the entire upper echelon of Fire Persimmon Immortal City disgraced. No one knew how the Shadow Demon Cultivator disappeared or where he went. But because of this, the City Lord's Mansion cleared themselves of suspicion."

Analyzing this, Ning Jiufan frowned again and murmured: "But why did the City Lord's Mansion kill Yuan Dasheng in front of everyone?"

Zhou Nongying smiled slightly: "Who would think that Yuan Dasheng's death was the doing of the City Lord's Mansion?"

"I believe they attacked Yuan Dasheng to create the illusion that the Shadow Demon Cultivator was still present, thereby spreading the responsibility among all of us. After all, it wasn't just the Golden Core cultivators of the City Lord's Mansion present at the time, but also our three families and even Lord Zhu Xuanji! None of us discovered the Shadow Demon Cultivator."

"Besides this reason, attacking Yuan Dasheng was, of course, for the Demonic Blood Vein Technique on him."

Ning Jiufan frowned: "Why kill Yuan Dasheng in front of everyone? If I were Fei Si, I would be more cautious and choose to act secretly after the Fire Persimmon Festival." Zhou Nongying said: "Maybe they discovered the Demonic Blood Vein Technique at that moment and acted immediately to avoid complications. Or perhaps they had already discovered the technique on Yuan Dasheng and acted during the Fire Persimmon Festival to eliminate all traces."

"But they didn't expect that this premeditated murder would have an unexpected twist."

"And that twist was our Lord Zhu Xuanji." At this point, Zhou Nongying and the others turned their gaze to Zhu Xuanji.

Zhu Xuanji nodded slightly: "At that time, I was moved by Yuan Dasheng's loyalty and chose to intervene, saving his life. I remember clearly that when I asked Fei Si to open the formation, he was reluctant and didn't want to obey my order. I did save Yuan Dasheng's life, but ultimately, Fei Si succeeded."

"He handed the waist token to Ning Zhuo, exploiting Ning Zhuo's selfishness to make him act. The latter went to the Monkey Head Gang's base and persuaded Yuan Er not to save Yuan Dasheng, leading to Yuan Dasheng's death from his injuries. Now it seems this was a small flaw left by Fei Si."

After a pause, Zhu Xuanji continued: "When Yuan Dasheng died, Yuan Er and Ning Zhuo were present. If the Demonic Blood Vein Technique was leaked at that time, Yuan Er should have known."

"Ning Zhuo took Yuan Dasheng's body to Chen Cha's Flying Disc Workshop. By the time we arrived, they had already processed the essence blood. Looking back, we were just a step too late. If we had been a bit faster, we might have discovered something." Zhu Xuanji sighed deeply, feeling very regretful.

If they had been a bit faster, they wouldn't have been kept in the dark for so long.

The three Golden Core cultivators were silent.

Because of the Shadow Demon Cultivator incident, they had lost face.

Now, looking back, they hadn't expected the truth to be like this! It was the City Lord's Mansion's doing, crying thief to catch the thief.

Although the events at the Fire Persimmon Festival had also embarrassed the City Lord's Mansion, their gains were greater.

On one hand, they cleared themselves of suspicion.

On the other hand, they eliminated Yuan Dasheng.

"So, the City Lord's Mansion obtained the Demonic Blood Vein Technique?" Zheng Danlian asked.

"This is a Golden Core level demonic technique. We don't know its contents, but since it was created by the three sects' masters, it must be an excellent technique." Talking about the Demonic Blood Vein Technique, the Golden Core cultivators couldn't help but show a hint of desire and curiosity.

"When exactly was the technique taken?" They continued to discuss.

"It might have been stolen beforehand. After all, Yuan Dasheng was a Fire Fusion Demon Ape. How could he openly display a demonic technique in a human Immortal City?"

"I lean towards it being taken during the Fire Persimmon Festival. Yuan Dasheng's mistake now seems very suspicious."

"Fei Si of the City Lord's Mansion has always controlled the formations in the Fire Persimmon Forest. He had the ability to disguise it and make us think it was Yuan Dasheng's mistake."

"The explosion caused by the mistake also temporarily blinded us." Zhu Xuanji suddenly said: "Do you know that not long after, Yuan Er also died?"

"And after that, the entire Monkey Head Gang was forcefully taken over by Ning Zhuo. They are now his subordinates, helping him manage the black market." In an instant, similar thoughts flashed through the minds of the three Golden Core ancestors—killing to silence witnesses! Destroying evidence!

"The City Lord's Mansion wanted to eliminate all traces."

"Then why is Ning Zhuo still alive?"

"Yes, if I were Fei Si, having planned so much, even if Ning Zhuo was just a pawn, even if Ning Zhuo was unaware, he was involved in so much. To be safe, I would still kill Ning Zhuo."

Zhu Xuanji smiled slightly: "You seem to have forgotten that not long after the Fire Persimmon Festival, the geniuses of your three families were all simultaneously assassinated."

"Meng Chong was also assassinated but perfectly dealt with the assassin."

"Your three families suffered great losses."

"Ning Zhuo was also assassinated. His entire residence was blown up, and he barely escaped with his life."

"I participated in the investigation at the time and always had a strange feeling."

"Looking back now, I finally understand where that strange feeling came from."

"The other geniuses were either stabbed or poisoned, which were controllable methods."

"Only Ning Zhuo encountered an explosion. The attack method was completely different from the others."

"If the City Lord's Mansion targeted the other geniuses to delay their exploration progress, then for Ning Zhuo, the killing intent was very clear. It was obvious they wanted Ning Zhuo dead."

At this point, Zhu Xuanji scanned the room and said: "I've explained everything to you."

"Now you should understand why I made such a big fuss about finding Ning Zhuo."

The hall fell silent.

"Stirring the grass to scare the snake."

"Drawing the snake out of its hole!"

Zhou Nongying and Zheng Danlian said simultaneously.
