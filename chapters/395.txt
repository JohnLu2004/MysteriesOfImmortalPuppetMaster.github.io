Chapter 385 - "So That's How It Is!":

"The Five Elements Divine Lord?!" Ning Zhuo quickly extended his divine sense into the stalactite.

However, he didn't discover anything unusual.

He couldn't even find a trace of the Five Elements Divine Lord.

Everything seemed as if it had just been an auditory hallucination.

But Ning Zhuo's gaze was focused - at this moment, he had confirmed part of his suspicions: there was definitely something strange about the Ten Thousand Demon Cave!

"Brother?" Linghu Jiu noticed Ning Zhuo's unusual expression.

Ning Zhuo looked at Linghu Jiu: "Elder Brother, I just heard the voice of the Five Elements Divine Lord. Previously, he appeared twice - first to teach me divine techniques, then to elevate my Five Elements realm."

Ning Zhuo didn't hide anything and directly repeated what the Five Elements Divine Lord had just said.

"Such a thing happened?!" Linghu Jiu was greatly surprised.

The two of them carefully examined the stalactite that had been pointed out.

Their divine senses swept back and forth, but they couldn't find anything unusual about this stalactite.

"Brother, was the Senior Five Elements Divine Lord specifically referring to this stalactite?" Linghu Jiu wanted to confirm again.

Ning Zhuo frowned: "Indeed, the earlier voice transmission came from this stalactite. But no matter how I examine it, it seems to just be an ordinary stalactite."

Compared to the many surrounding stalactites, this one wasn't special. It was rooted in the cave wall's ceiling, hanging downward, its surface covered in delicate patterns like flowing water waves, emanating an ancient and mysterious aura.

The stalactite's surface was quite damp, with a water droplet gradually forming at the stone's tip.

The droplet gradually grew larger, then separated from the stone column, lightly falling downward. It pierced through the still air, seemingly slow yet fast, striking the ground with a light "drip" sound.

In that instant, both Ning Zhuo and Linghu Jiu were stunned, both feeling that this mysterious water droplet was like time incarnate, carrying secrets from tens of thousands of years ago, yet bringing a fresh essence - from its formation to its fall and shattering, a moment containing a thousand years!

Ning Zhuo and Linghu Jiu looked at each other, both seeing the amazement in each other's expressions.

Ning Zhuo exclaimed softly: "So, the stalactite itself is ordinary - the water droplet is the key!"

Linghu Jiu marveled: "Amazing! In the instant the water droplet fell, I sensed the solemn aura of an ancient formation. I've passed through here over a hundred times, never imagining the secret entrance was hidden within a water droplet."

"The opportunity to enter exists only during the time the droplet falls."

"What kind of formation is this exactly?"

Ning Zhuo also slightly frowned, indicating he hadn't heard of it before.

But within the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, Sun Lingtong transmitted: "I remember, Master once mentioned to me... this might be the Jade Hourglass Drop Formation."

"This formation contains principles of time and ages, able to greatly slow down the passage of time within the formation, achieving relative life extension. But it must be arranged in a dark environment, requiring little to no light."

"Earlier, Little Zhuo, didn't you raise questions about the Five Elements Divine Lord's lifespan? Perhaps this formation is the answer."

After discussing briefly, Ning Zhuo and Linghu Jiu immediately decided to enter the formation together.

As the water droplet fell, both men locked their divine sense onto it and plunged in together.

In their vision, the water droplet grew larger and larger, transforming in an instant from a droplet to the size of a hill.

From the outside, it appeared as if the water droplet released a strange light, enveloping the two men, making their bodies rapidly shrink as they entered the droplet.

Drip.

The next moment, the water droplet fell onto the rocky surface, splitting into countless tiny liquid fragments.

Ning Zhuo and Linghu Jiu disappeared from their original location. Without their spiritual power supporting it, the light quickly dispersed, and the cave once again sank into darkness and stillness.

The two men entered the droplet, entering the formation.

This was a world within the formation, filled with luminous mist.

After entering, both Ning Zhuo and Linghu Jiu stood in place, not daring to move carelessly.

From within the Ten Thousand Li Dragon, Sun Lingtong let out a surprised exclamation: "There's another formation inside! This is a formation within a formation!"

"The Jade Hourglass Drop Formation is already very advanced, but it's only the outer formation. Brother, be extremely careful, this inner formation must be even more extraordinary!"

Beside him, Linghu Jiu also marveled: "A formation within a formation! Brother Ning Zhuo, I have very little knowledge of formations, being most skilled in swordsmanship and wine tasting. I dare not move randomly, you should examine this formation first."

Ning Zhuo looked around for a while but found that the luminous mist blocked his vision, making it impossible to see beyond five paces.

The mist was pure white, but occasionally large patches of shadow would flash by, disappearing instantly.

Though Ning Zhuo was skilled in mechanical arts and had some knowledge of formations, at this moment he was completely lost, unable to discern the formation's nature.

"No matter. Big Brother, it's your turn!" Ning Zhuo transmitted.

Sun Lingtong laughed playfully: "This kind of exploration is the most interesting, watch me."

Saying this, he activated his Spirit Eyes, radiating brilliant spiritual light that penetrated the white mist to see the broader space.

Sun Lingtong's expertise in formations was even deeper than Ning Zhuo's.

While Ning Zhuo had deeply studied mechanical arts, formations weren't his main focus. Sun Lingtong, however, had a deeper understanding of formations.

On one hand, Sun Lingtong had also studied the mechanical classics left by Meng Yaoyin. On the other hand, Sun Lingtong came from the Void Sect - thieves studied formations as it was essential for making a living.

Finally, Sun Lingtong was older than Ning Zhuo, having had more time to study formations.

After seeing many things clearly, Sun Lingtong immediately transmitted to Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo smiled slightly: "Elder Brother Linghu, I've figured it out. Follow me."

Ning Zhuo reached out and grabbed Linghu Jiu's arm, taking the lead.

The white mist suddenly rippled, inverting the five senses and confusing directions.

With each step, Ning Zhuo had to adjust for several breaths.

Sun Lingtong continued his surveillance.

After the sixth step, a faint cave opening appeared in the white mist.

Sun Lingtong said: "This is the way out. Following this cave opening should allow us to exit the formation space and return to the outside world."

"Is that so?" Ning Zhuo turned his head, preparing to inform Linghu Jiu of this discovery.

But when he turned around, Linghu Jiu had already disappeared!

Ning Zhuo's heart skipped a beat.

He had thought he was holding onto Linghu Jiu's arm the whole time, but the formation had inverted his senses, causing him to misjudge.

"This is bad. Linghu Jiu is lost in this formation, we need to go back and find him," Sun Lingtong said.

He acknowledged Linghu Jiu's excellence and character, and since Ning Zhuo held goodwill toward Linghu Jiu, he too appreciated Linghu Jiu by extension.

However, Ning Zhuo's expression was somewhat strange at this moment, and he firmly shook his head: "No! Let's follow this exit path and leave here first."

"Big Brother, I'm coming in first."

Ning Zhuo released the Mechanical Dragon and climbed inside to join Sun Lingtong.

"Can the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon traverse space in here?" Ning Zhuo asked.

Sun Lingtong nodded: "I just tried it out, this ability hasn't been sealed, we can still use it."

Ning Zhuo nodded: "That's good."

The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon was at the Nascent Soul level, and though it had no combat capabilities, its escape abilities were extremely strong. Having a Nascent Soul’s ability to traverse space was the source of Ning Zhuo's confidence in exploring this place.

Both Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong came to the dragon's head cabin, controlling the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon to fly toward the faint cave opening.

As they advanced, the cave opening transformed from illusory to real, and quickly became a dark mountain passage.

The Ten Thousand Li Dragon concealed itself and followed the mountain path upward.

It was clearly perceptible that the mountain path sloped upward diagonally.

The mountain path was completely quiet, with no traps or demon beasts blocking the way. The higher they went, the more evident human traces became.

Moments later, the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon emerged from the bottom of a dried-up well.

The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon left the well and flew into the air.

Sun and Ning saw a scene of pavilions, towers, and ornately decorated buildings.

People occasionally moved through the courtyards and corridors.

"Isn't this Origin Mountain?" Sun Lingtong recognized the place.

The next moment, he realized something and sharply inhaled, turning to look at Ning Zhuo: "Little Zhuo!!"

"Did you have suspicions before, which is why you deliberately brought Linghu Jiu to explore the Ten Thousand Demons Cave together?"

Even though Ning Zhuo had some mental preparation, a chill still spread through his heart at this moment.

He solemnly nodded slowly.

"Origin Mountain wasn’t here originally, it had to have been moved here."

"But in the ancient formation, there's an exit leading directly here, which proves someone had already discovered the Jade Hourglass Drop Formation beforehand."

"And the biggest suspect in this matter is the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect's leader, Lin Bufan."

"His cultivation has reached the Nascent Soul level, and he controls the Ten Thousand Medicines Valley. Secretly making these arrangements wouldn't be difficult for him."

Sun Lingtong fell silent for a moment, then had another realization: "Many years ago, Lin Bufan strongly advocated moving the entire Ten Thousand Medicines Sect to Ten Thousand Medicines Valley. Could it be that he wasn't just interested in the spirit springs here!"

"He hasn't fully mastered this opportunity yet. The best proof is you, Little Zhuo!"

"You received the Five Organs Temple Spirit Technique because of the Five Elements Divine Lord's transmission, and got a huge promotion in the Five Elements realm. If Lin Bufan had completely mastered this opportunity, he wouldn't have let an outsider like you benefit so easily."

"So, the Profound Thought Fermented Wine really is fake, Hua Guzi was right!"

"The real reason is that there's already a great expert's legacy here. That's why, Little Zhuo, you still received the Five Elements Divine Lord's guidance when you sat under the Spirit Concealing Willow, and also heard the Five Elements Divine Lord's voice in the underground cave."

"The things buried here should trace back to the Martial Emperor era and are closely related to the Five Elements Divine Lord."

"No, it's not just him!"

"Linghu Jiu once said he had also received quite a bit of guidance. This was actually also due to the opportunity buried underground in the Ten Thousand Demons Cave."

"Linghu Jiu... does he know about this?"

Ning Zhuo's eyes flickered with sharp light: "Most likely not."

"He's also being kept in the dark. Otherwise, given his character and mindset of thinking for the sect's benefit, he wouldn't have actively given me the Netherworld Contemplation Wine, creating such a huge flaw for no reason."

Sun Lingtong nodded: "Yes. If he knew, he wouldn't have agreed so readily to explore the demon cave with you just now."

"This is bad!"

"Lin Bufan knows about you now!!"

"Little Zhuo, you didn't hide the fact that you received the Five Elements Divine Lord's legacy before. Linghu Jiu knows, and although he didn't covet the Five Organs Temple Spirit Technique, he would definitely inform his master."

"Because the Ning family and Ten Thousand Medicines Sect are negotiating about future alliance. This kind of intelligence would increase Lin Bufan's attention toward us. He probably even thinks he secretly helped you."

Sun Lingtong was also quite shrewd and quickly deduced more of the truth.

"What's our next move? What are you thinking, Little Zhuo?" Sun Lingtong frowned and expressed his concerns, "Lin Bufan has spent over a hundred years plotting to obtain the opportunity here, making extensive arrangements. But until now, he hasn't gained complete control."

"This shows that the opportunity here is no small matter. And judging from your recent gains, Little Zhuo, it further proves the immense value of this opportunity."

"Lin Bufan already knows we've touched upon some secrets. Now that we've secretly explored the demon cave, Lin Bufan will definitely discover it."

"Will he allow us to get involved in this enormous opportunity?"

Ning Zhuo chuckled: "This is precisely the key to the current situation!"

Sun Lingtong took a deep breath: "We should immediately notify your family's Golden Core elder. In my opinion, we should have notified them beforehand!"

Ning Zhuo gave a bitter smile.

Sun Lingtong suddenly had a terrible realization: "I understand now, we absolutely cannot notify Ning Jiufan ahead of time."

"Because he's already under Lin Bufan's strict surveillance!"

Ning Zhuo nodded: "Exactly."

"Years ago, when our Ning family migrated, following the underground river out of Ten Thousand Demons Cave to arrive in the valley, we received Lin Bufan's warm welcome."

"He forcibly kept our clan in the valley, hosting us for several months before letting us leave."

"During this period, he must have been secretly investigating, checking if anyone in our clan had discovered this opportunity."

"Only after confirming there wasn't, did he finally let the Ning family leave."

"This time, when Ning Jiufan and I came to the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect one after another, in Lin Bufan's mind, he must have had many suspicions."

"Did the Ning family discover something back then? After establishing themselves in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, did they come back here to explore?"

"Lin Bufan might guess like this: The Ning family doesn't know that I, Lin Bufan, know about this opportunity, so they want to dig secretly. The Ning family first sent their most talented young descendant to investigate, then sent their Golden Core elder under the pretext of alliance and cooperation, trying to find a legitimate reason to stay long-term and secretly explore the opportunity."

"Under such suspicion and doubt, if I contact Ning Jiufan, Lin Bufan would likely know instantly. He must be closely monitoring both me and our ancestors."

"Now, what we need to do can be summed up in one word — wait."

Sun Lingtong's eyes lit up: "We've already discovered the Jade Hourglass Drop Formation and mysteriously disappeared. Lin Bufan must be anxious. His next actions will reveal his true attitude toward us!"

"Exactly," Ning Zhuo nodded.

Just as his words fell, in the next moment, the world changed color!

Suddenly, the formation activated.

Origin Mountain shook!

The mountain-protecting formation isolated the inside from the outside, forming a huge luminous mist that rapidly expanded.

Within a few breaths, the white luminous mist had expanded outward, covering Ten Thousand Medicines Valley, encompassing Origin Mountain, Little Contention Peak, Great Contention Peak, and Medicine Field Mountain.

The scene outside attracted Ning Jiufan's attention. He extended his divine sense and asked puzzledly: "Lord Lin, why suddenly activate the mountain-protecting formation? Is there a powerful enemy attacking?"

Lin Bufan smiled.

He first inserted the one thousand eight hundred and seventieth fine needle into the old prisoner's body, making them fall into deep sleep.

Then, he turned to look at Ning Jiufan, his eyes flashing with fierceness: "Friend Ning's acting skills are quite good."

Ning Jiufan: ???
