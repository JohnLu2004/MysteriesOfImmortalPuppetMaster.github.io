Chapter 621: How Can This Be Called Dual Cultivation?

The space within the Formation resembled an enormous vertical shaft, its depths unfathomable, as if plunging straight into the Nine Hells.

Within the shaft, yin qi surged like a tide, thick as ink. It was no longer a massive stream of energy, but rather a viscous liquid that churned and roiled.

"Blackwater Mountain White Paper City..." The sight stirred a memory in Ning Zhuo, recalling the name by which the White Paper Immortal City was known to the outside world.

The shaft's walls gleamed like polished mirrors, neither stone nor jade, seemingly formed entirely by the Formation's structure.

The blackwater-like yin qi seethed within the shaft, roaring and crashing. At times, it would surge into towering waves several zhang high, their collisions producing thunderous booms that reverberated through the space.

Yang Sanyan, Wen Ruanyu, and Ning Zhuo stood at the edge of the shaft, feeling the bone-chilling cold emanating from the "blackwater." Its frigid temperature surpassed that of ice and snow, piercing straight to the marrow. Their yang qi was suppressed, and even their spiritual energy circulation threatened to freeze.

Amidst this raging tide of yin qi, a figure floated serenely - the White Paper City Lord.

She did not drift with the currents, but maintained a state of near-stasis, her bearing exuding supreme dignity as she slowly rose and fell within the turbulent black tide.

She had a standard oval face, but her skeletal structure was strikingly defined and robust. Her cheekbones stood high and sharp like chiseled blades, her jawline firm and powerful. Even in sleep, she exuded an air of unquestionable resolve and coldness.

Her beauty was like two slender, sharp swords slanting into her hair. Her black eyebrows had already been dusted with a layer of silver-gray, as if coated in frost.

Her eyes were tightly closed, their shape long and sharp like phoenix eyes. Even shut, the curve of her eyelids resembled meticulously drawn ink strokes, their ends sharply upturned, outlining an air of nobility, arrogance, and scrutiny.

Her lips were thin and clearly defined, originally a fierce cinnabar red but now a lifeless pale purple, like withered wisteria petals. They remained tightly pressed together, maintaining a cold distance that repelled others even in unconsciousness.

Her figure was tall and straight, her skeletal structure balanced. Even lying flat, she radiated an aura of resilience and strength.

Her long hair spread out, black as obsidian, so dark that not even the Blackwater Yin Tide could dim its luster. At the ends of her hair, the black gradually transitioned into an eerie dark blue. Among the strands, occasional ice-blue crystals of Yin Qi flickered like stars before swiftly disappearing into the dense waves of hair.

"City Lord..." Wen Ruanyu sighed.

After so long, he had finally seen the City Lord's True Form, but the latter was clearly in a dire state, completely unable to awaken.

Yang Sanyan narrowed his eyes. This was his first time seeing the current White Paper Immortal City Lord.

Despite his broad experience and cold heart, even he found himself captivated by the City Lord's enchanting beauty.

This was while she remained unconscious. One could scarcely imagine what majestic bearing she would exude when her eyes opened.

Yin Qi churned in the well like boiling water, its waves crashing with thunderous force.

Yet at the very center stood the White Paper City Lord, like a time-preserved amber. Within a few feet of her body, all the raging energy seemed suppressed by an invisible will emanating from her very being, becoming sluggish and slow.

The White Paper City Lord was like a ten-thousand-year-old shard of black ice thrown into an ink sea. Not only did she fail to melt, but she voraciously assimilated and absorbed this destructive energy.

Each slow rise and fall of her form seemed like an unconscious breath, drawing in vast quantities of Yin Qi into her body.

The exposed skin, now visible through her robes, was mottled with blue-green hues, resembling the flesh of a ghost. Combined with her imposing presence, she seemed like an underworld ruler being paid homage to.

The City Lord's Paper Doll Clone sighed deeply. "This is the state of my True Form. To protect the entire White Paper Immortal City, she has absorbed most of the Yin Qi, leaving her unconscious for many years, difficult to revive."

Wen Ruanyu examined her intently, his expression grave. "The City Lord was originally a cultivator of the Yang Realm. Her Yang Qi should far exceed her Yin Qi. But now, burdened with excessive Yin Qi, she's teetering on the brink of death!"

"What can we do?"

The Paper Doll Clone shook her head. "I've secretly considered countless methods, but none prove effective. The main issue lies in my True Form's critical state. Any intervention strong enough to disrupt the balance would shatter this fragile condition, leading to immediate death!"

"Yet without such force, how can we hope to combat this mountainous Yin Tide?"

As if finally able to speak after long suppression, the Paper Doll Clone continued her lament: "For years, I've concealed my true situation for the sake of the Immortal City's greater good, sealing my True Form here."

"Left with no choice, this clone has had to impersonate the original to handle certain matters."

Yang Sanyan's brow furrowed deeply.

If the True Form was in such a state, fundamentally unable to be awakened, how could they form a Divine Contract? Even signing with the clone would severely diminish its binding power.

"The Sect's intelligence was correct," Yang Sanyan mused. "The current White Paper City Lord is a woman of ambition and controlling desires. Despite her precarious position, she's stubbornly clung to power, enduring silently for all these years."

If this truth were exposed, the City Lord's position would face numerous challenges. Her True Form, unable to fight effectively, would make it easy for others to depose her.

Yang Sanyan produced the Divine Contract. "City Lord, I never imagined your situation was so dire. If your True Form can't be awakened, this contract will fail to establish even the most basic trust between us!"

"How can we resolve this?"

The Paper Doll Clone shook her head slowly, a bitter expression on her face.

Wen Ruanyu suddenly said, "So that's why the City Lord recruited so many Male Consorts."

"It's because her True Form is unconscious. Only through Dual Cultivation with others, where the partner takes the lead, can Yin and Yang merge. This lessens the City Lord's burden of Yin Qi."

"Moreover, Yin-Yang Dual Cultivation embodies profound cosmic principles. Even if Yin Qi were as vast as the sea, it must transform obediently rather than extinguishing the flame with a flood."

The Paper Doll Clone continued, "Unfortunately, I channeled my body's Yin Qi through the Formation into places like Hidden Yang Manor and Vigorous Yang Manor. Even with all the Male Consorts combined, their efforts are but a drop in the bucket against the total Yin Qi. It's barely enough to maintain my True Form's precarious state."

"The Golden Swallow Trident's Yang Qi, however, isn't suitable for Dual Cultivation. Moreover, it's tainted with Demonic Qi, making it completely unsuitable for my True Form."

"The reason it manifested was merely to give everyone something to cling to, a sliver of hope."

Ning Zhuo's emotions surged. He thought of Sun Tiesheng, whose cultivation path had been destroyed by this very situation, forcing him to transform into a half-man, half-demon.

If Sun Tiesheng could hear these words, what would he feel?

Sun Tiesheng was already dead, and Shen Bing and Chen Sui had perished because of the Golden Swallow Trident.

If they knew this was all a scheme orchestrated by the City Lord, what would they think?

Even Zheng Shoumo had been deceived.

Due to the Golden Swallow Trident's recognition of its master, he had acted repeatedly. His hasty actions revealed flaws, allowing Ning Zhuo to grasp his tail.

To be fair, Ning Zhuo himself had been a driving force behind this development.

Without his and Wen Ruanyu's scheme, they wouldn't have established the Spirit Contract Treasure Refining Formation at the Vigorous Yang Manor, creating such a grand spectacle.

"What about Li Xiangshang?" Ning Zhuo's heart stirred.

Li Xiangshang had been sent by the White-Haired Dragon Sovereign.

"The White-Haired Dragon Sovereign first sent Jin Yangzi, then added Li Xiangshang. What does he know? What kind of agreement does he have with the White Paper City Lord?"

"Is Li Xiangshang also a driving force, though he himself doesn't realize it?"

As Ning Zhuo considered this, he gained a new understanding of the White Paper Immortal City's bewildering situation.

The true grand scheme was the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's century-old conspiracy. Under the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual, the White Paper Immortal City had already been designated as a blood sacrifice site.

"My mother learned of this through Ash Bone Elder, but he didn't inform the White Paper City Lord."

"Then does the White Paper City Lord know about this?"

On the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's chessboard, the White Paper City Lord was a mere pawn, and the White Paper Immortal City was the flesh he sought to devour.

On the White Paper City Lord's chessboard, the Golden Swallow Trident served as her tool. Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer, Wen Ruanyu, and even Ning Zhuo were her pieces. Sun Tiesheng, Shen Bing, Chen Sui, and other male consorts were her discarded pawns. Li Xiangshang was likely another piece, but whether the White-Haired Dragon Sovereign was one remained uncertain to Ning Zhuo.

"What the mysterious organization is, I'm not yet qualified to know. Only by joining the Myriad Manifestations Sect can I gain further opportunities."

"The message left by my mother made me appear as a pawn on the surface, yet secretly gave me the potential to become a chess player."

"Yang Sanyan wants the City Lord's True Form to sign a Divine Contract. This is advantageous for me."

The White Paper City Lord generously supported Ning Zhuo, showing no stinginess in her rewards. Even her sponsorship of the Qing-Jiao Army was marked by grand magnanimity.

Any ordinary person would have been thoroughly devoted, offering unwavering loyalty.

But Ning Zhuo was no ordinary person.

He had clearly seen through the situation and understood the true nature of the White Paper City Lord's character.

Therefore, he decisively chose to stand with the Myriad Manifestations Sect.

"Is the White Paper City Lord an accomplice of Zheng Shoumo?"

"This question is crucial!"

"If she is, I absolutely won't risk participating in the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual."

According to Yang Sanyan's account, Ning Zhuo's mother was likely murdered by a mysterious organization. This meant that the message left by Meng Yaoyin was inferior in level to this organization.

It was even possible that the mysterious organization had already known about the message left by Meng Yaoyin and deliberately preserved it.

Having reached this point in his thoughts, Ning Zhuo had grasped the key point: "We must awaken the City Lord's True Form."

With his thoughts settled, he took decisive action.

Immediately, he broke the silence: "To awaken the City Lord, it's actually not difficult."

This single sentence immediately drew the attention of everyone present to Ning Zhuo.

"You have a method?" Yang Sanyan asked curiously.

Ning Zhuo clasped his hands, his face solemn as he declared with grave importance, "To inform you all, I possess some medical knowledge. I have a technique that can resolve the City Lord's True Form's current predicament."

Yang Sanyan nodded decisively. "Then please demonstrate this technique, young man."

Wen Ruanyu watched with anticipation.

The Paper Doll Clone murmured, "Very well, but I must supervise the entire process closely."

"Of course," Ning Zhuo replied with a smile. "This medical art of mine permits external observation."

"Proceed," the Paper Doll Clone gestured.

She activated the Formation, allowing the Blackwater Yin Tide to lift the City Lord's True Form, slowly raising it to the well's edge.

Ning Zhuo stood before the City Lord's True Form.

As he approached, he realized the City Lord's stature was imposing - nearly three meters tall.

He reached out decisively, drawing closer to the City Lord's body.

When his palm was still a meter away, he felt as if it had been pricked by needles.

The City Lord's True Form contained terrifyingly vast reserves of Yin Qi!

Any ordinary Nascent Soul Cultivator would have perished. Only the White Paper Immortal City Lord, relying on her innate talent, could have achieved such an extraordinary state.

Ning Zhuo wisely halted, maintaining a three-foot distance as he positioned his palm toward the City Lord's True Form.

The Paper Doll Clone, Yang Sanyan, and Wen Ruanyu watched intently, their eyes fixed on Ning Zhuo's movements.

To the surprise of all three observers, Ning Zhuo didn't activate any medical techniques. Instead, he directly expelled a stream of Yang Qi from his palm.

The Paper Doll Clone's expression immediately turned disappointed.

She had expected Ning Zhuo to perform some mystical medical art, but instead, he was simply employing the old Yin-Yang Dual Cultivation method.

"Ning Zhuo is merely at the Foundation Establishment stage. While his combat strength is formidable, he's still too young. How much Yang Qi could he possibly possess?"

"Hm?!"

In the next instant, the Paper Doll Clone's expression changed dramatically.

She watched in astonishment as the Yang Qi surged forth. Without needing Ning Zhuo's control or his participation in the dual cultivation, it flowed directly into the White Paper Immortal City Lord's True Form, like a fledgling returning to its nest.

As this happened, the Yang Qi rapidly merged with the Yin Qi.

The fusion occurred with astonishing speed and efficiency, achieving perfect harmony!

Noticing this, Yang Sanyan and Wen Ruanyu also showed expressions of surprise, their regard for Ning Zhuo growing.

"How strange! What kind of method is this? The condensed Yang Qi is so closely aligned with the True Form, it's practically indistinguishable from it itself!" the City Lord Clone marveled.

Wen Ruanyu nodded in admiration. "Though Young Master Ning Zhuo's cultivation level is low, his methods are extraordinary. He continually surpasses expectations."

Yang Sanyan remarked, "Rather than calling it medical art, it's more akin to dual cultivation, isn't it? I never imagined you'd be so skilled in dual cultivation, Ning Zhuo!"

"Ahem." Ning Zhuo coughed repeatedly. "How can you call this dual cultivation?"

"Only the exchange of Primordial Yang and Primordial Yin constitutes true dual cultivation!"

"This level of cultivation is merely me producing some resources for the City Lord's use."

"Senior Yang, I intend to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect in the future. I'm still young - please don't ruin my reputation!"

Yang Sanyan blinked. "This technique of yours is truly profound! It seems capable of refining your Yang Qi to perfectly match any individual."

"Remarkable!"

"If exposed, countless female cultivators would seek to dual cultivate with you."

Ning Zhuo coughed twice. "This method drains my reserves. It mustn't be overused or relied upon regularly. Circumstances forced my hand today. I implore everyone present to keep this secret!"

"I won't breathe a word," Yang Sanyan said.

Wen Ruanyu added, "A gentleman keeps his lips sealed tighter than a bottle."

The Paper Doll Clone spoke, "Truly worthy of being our Immortal City's savior. Young Master Ning Zhuo, your methods are consistently astonishing. Ah, to think you've depleted your reserves for this - your compensation will be substantial! I urge you to continue these efforts. Saving my True Form means saving all of White Paper City."

Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth, acting as if he'd exhausted all his strength. Secretly, he activated the Demonic Blood Vein Technique, manipulating his blood qi to rapidly drain his complexion of color.

In truth, the Yang Qi he'd expelled came from the Yin-Yang One Qi Kettle. It was essentially transformed Yin Qi from the White Paper Immortal City Lord, having little to do with him personally.

Moments later, the real White Paper City Lord's eyelids fluttered open. Her first gaze fell upon the large-headed youth she'd been dual cultivating with.
