Chapter 390: Ancestor, Come Quick, I'll Show You a Great Treasure

At the Mountain Gate Master's Mansion.

Xiao Ju handed Lin Shanshan some intelligence.

After reading the jade slip with her spiritual sense, Lin Shanshan said disappointedly, "Ning Zhuo is still in seclusion and hasn't come out yet?"

"Big Senior Brother is really something, being a drunkard himself, and getting someone drunk on their first meeting."

"I wonder if Young Master Ning Zhuo drank too much at once and is still in seclusion, sleeping off the alcohol? Spiritual wine is different from ordinary wine. Even a cultivator who drinks too much spiritual wine might not be able to sober up for months, or even years in some cases."

Xiao Ju said, "Young Miss, you weren't there at the time, you didn't see the scene with your own eyes."

"I actually think Young Master Ning Zhuo likes to drink himself."

Lin Shanshan suddenly became a bit anxious, twirling her hair and thinking, "Oh my, why did I get confined? I wonder what Young Master Ning Zhuo looks like when he's drunk."

"Speaking of which, I should criticize you. Why didn't you record the scene that day with a jade slip?"

Xiao Ju said apologetically, "Young Miss, please don't criticize me for this. I already know I was wrong!"

"You've criticized me no less than a hundred times these past few days."

"Not to mention that privately recording someone's situation is a very offensive thing to do. I'm just a servant, a maid, how could I capture images of Big Senior Brother?"

"Even if I had such thoughts that day, wouldn't Big Senior Brother or Young Master Ning Zhuo have seen through it immediately?"

"At that time, if I were driven out, wouldn't Big Senior Brother and Young Master Ning Zhuo be left without anyone to take care of them?"

"That's more like it."

As the two were talking, a servant came with a message.

It was a letter from Ning Jiufan.

Xiao Ju reacted a beat late, feeling puzzled: "Why would the Ning family's Golden Core Ancestor send a letter to you, Young Miss?"

Lin Shanshan's eyes brightened: "Xiao Ju, didn't you hear Young Master Ning Zhuo say last time that he and Ning Jiufan are close? This must be a letter from Young Master Ning Zhuo, just sent through Ning Jiufan."

"I've been confined and watched over by many senior brothers, who won't let me contact Young Master Ning Zhuo or receive his letters. But they wouldn't dare intercept a letter from Ancestor Ning Jiufan."

"Haha, it's all thanks to Young Master Ning Zhuo for coming up with this clever method!"

Lin Shanshan took the letter and opened it. Her expression changed from joy to worry.

"Ah, Young Master Ning Zhuo's spirit plant has a problem. If it can't be saved, it will surely die."

"What should we do?"

Xiao Ju also became worried.

Although she had only met Ning Zhuo twice, she had taken a liking to him.

Xiao Ju was more worried about Lin Shanshan: "Young Miss, you're confined now, how can you help Young Master Ning Zhuo?"

Lin Shanshan looked at the letter: "Young Master Ning Zhuo also said in the letter that he wants to seek help from Big Senior Brother. With Big Senior Brother's help, it would be much more useful than mine."

Xiao Ju finally felt relieved.

Almost at the same time, Ning Zhuo arrived at the Ten Thousand Demons Cave again.

"Elder Brother Linghu!" He brought cloud tea and was warmly welcomed by Linghu Jiu.

"Haha, Brother Ning Zhuo, please come in quickly." Linghu Jiu stepped out of the cave entrance, took Ning Zhuo's arm, and led him inside.

Ning Zhuo offered the special cloud tea, saying this tea could help one understand the principles of the clouds.

Linghu Jiu accepted it directly: "Good tea, good tea. Even if I don't drink it, I'll distribute it to my junior brothers and sisters."

Ning Zhuo said, "Elder Brother Linghu, don't worry. Since our last drink together, I and your sect's senior and junior brothers like Lao De have resolved all our grievances."

Linghu Jiu laughed heartily and led Ning Zhuo to a seat: "Speaking of which, these past few days drinking alone has been quite tasteless. Now that Brother Ning Zhuo is here, let's drink until we're drunk!"

Ning Zhuo was initially delighted, but then smiled bitterly and explained his predicament.

Linghu Jiu didn't hesitate. He took out his identity token and gave it to Ning Zhuo: "Use as much of the sect's resources as you need!"

"If it's not enough, just tell me. I have enough influence among my junior brothers and sisters to gather more resources."

Ning Zhuo just cupped his hands and casually thanked him.

This attitude pleased Linghu Jiu greatly: "Excellent, Brother Ning Zhuo should be this casual. We're drinking buddies, we're our own people!"

"But, with your spirit plant in such a critical condition, can you treat it by yourself?"

"There are many cultivators in our sect who are proficient with spirit plants, and my master is the best among them. If possible, I advise you to seek help from experts for treatment."

"When a spirit plant is critically ill, many daily cultivation and nurturing methods have little effect, and may even have the opposite effect."

Ning Zhuo nodded, keeping this advice in mind.

Before leaving, he told Linghu Jiu about receiving further teachings from the Five Elements Divine Lord after returning to his cave dwelling on Little Contention Peak.

"At that time, I hadn't drunk any more of the Meditative Brew, so how did I receive another transmission from the Divine Lord?" Ning Zhuo expressed his confusion.

Linghu Jiu was also quite puzzled: "This situation is indeed strange, I haven't encountered it before."

"Perhaps you still had some lingering alcohol in your body, allowing you to communicate with the ancestors in the netherworld?"

"After all... no one has ever drunk so much Meditative Brew at once before."

Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly and waved his hand: "I'm embarrassed, Elder Brother Linghu. Drinking so fiercely was indeed my first time."

"May I be so bold as to ask, Elder Brother, can the recipe for the Meditative Brew be sold to me?"

Linghu Jiu frowned: "If it were mine, why would I need to sell it? I'd just give it to you, brother. The problem is, this wine recipe was specially sought out by my master."

"For this, master paid a huge sum to that Black and White Wine Immortal."

"If you're interested in the recipe, you can use the Ning family's Golden Core Ancestor to include this transaction as part of the cooperation between our two parties."

Ning Zhuo nodded and sighed: "I'm afraid Sect Leader Lin Bufan won't allow it."

Linghu Jiu snorted: "I actually think this is feasible. After all, in this sect, the Meditative Brew is only suitable for my use. Others have tried it, but with little gain, practically useless to them."

"You, brother, are special, so the value of this wine is truly great for you."

"Hey, you can get wine from me, you know."

"Master gives me a few jars of Meditative Brew regularly. Don't leave yet, I'll give you half a jar right now."

Linghu Jiu only had one jar of Meditative Brew left, but he still gave half of it to Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo was quite moved. He thanked him again and bid a reluctant farewell to Linghu Jiu.

With Linghu Jiu's token, he could move freely on the original mountain. He first went to the library, read many books, but couldn't find a definite solution.
Although he collected many rescue methods for spirit plants, he didn't dare to use them recklessly.

Some books and secret classics indeed recorded cultivation and treatment methods for the Spirit Concealing Willow. But the situations in the books differed from what Ning Zhuo was facing.
Unable to prescribe the right treatment himself, Ning Zhuo had to consult several well-known and friendly spirit plant users in the Ten Thousand Medicines Sect.

These spirit plant masters heard Ning Zhuo's questions and all shook their heads, saying they needed to determine exactly what the spirit plant was before they could prescribe the right treatment.

Ning Zhuo thought for a moment, then concealed some information and directly set up a case study, including the Spirit Concealing Willow in it.

As a result, the spirit plant masters all said that even for the same disease, the treatment methods differ depending on the severity and urgency, requiring specific judgment.

After hitting a dead end, Ning Zhuo went to find Ning Jiufan.

"Ancestor, come quick, I'll show you something good!" Ning Zhuo called out to Ning Jiufan.

Ning Jiufan became wary: "You little rascal, what mischief are you up to now? What kind of trap are you setting?"

"This is a treasure. You'll regret it for life if you don't see it." As he spoke, Ning Zhuo untied the mechanism dragon from his waist.

"The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon? No wonder this little guy could run away so quickly!" Ning Jiufan's eyes lit up.

Ning Zhuo said nonchalantly: "The mere Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon is nothing compared to the great treasure I'm about to show you!"

This further piqued Ning Jiufan's curiosity.

Immediately, Ning Zhuo led Ning Jiufan into the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.

A while later.

Inside the spirit plant cabin.

"This, this, this! If my old eyes aren't deceiving me, this should be the Spirit Concealing Willow!"

"A Spirit Concealing Willow with Golden Core aura, incredible, incredible! Even I can be uplifted by it."

"But... why is its vitality and aura so weak?"

Ning Zhuo pointed at the Spirit Concealing Willow: "Ancestor, your perspective is too narrow."

"How can you only think of yourself?"

"This is a legacy treasure! When we take it back to the family in the future, the whole clan will benefit."

"Our Ning family will grow and prosper!"

Ning Jiufan laughed angrily: "You're not wrong, my perspective isn't as broad as yours. So, you little rascal, do you want to release it for the whole clan to use? Including the main branch?"

Ning Zhuo smiled: "That's not impossible!"

Jiufan was suddenly curious.

Ning Zhuo added: "As long as Ancestor helps to save this Spirit Concealing Willow!"

Jiufan was shocked: "What? It's dying?"

Ning Zhuo spread his hands: "This current state and aura is barely maintained by my utmost efforts and enormous expenditure."

"Ancestor, whether our Ning family can have another legacy treasure depends on you now!"

Ning Jiufan rubbed his forehead, feeling immense pressure, and couldn't help but laugh and curse: "You little brat, so this is where you were waiting for your old ancestor!"
