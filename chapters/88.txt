Chapter 88: He was the Inventor of the Explosive Fire Monkey!

Ning Xiaoren returned to his reception hall and quickly summoned Ning Ze.

"Come, sit, have some tea." Ning Xiaoren smiled as he gestured for Ning Ze to sit to his side.

Ning Ze was filled with suspicion and uncertainty. This was the first time Ning Xiaoren had treated him like this.

He quickly said, "If there's anything that needs doing, please give me your instructions, junior patriarch."

Ning Xiaoren pointed to the seat.

Ning Ze sat down uneasily.

Ning Xiaoren took a light sip of tea and sighed emotionally. "Ning Ze, you’ve raised a good nephew."

Ning Ze stood up at once. "Sir, did Little Zhuo do something wrong? I’ll go home right away and discipline him properly!"

Ning Xiaoren’s eyes widened slightly. He waved his hand three times. "Sit, sit. No need to be nervous. It’s good news, a joyous matter."

As he spoke, the half-seated Ning Ze gradually widened his eyes, and then even opened his mouth in disbelief.

Even when he left Ning Xiaoren’s reception hall and returned home, the look of shock still lingered on his face.

Peak of the third level of Qi Refining!

Standing out during the joint examination of the three clans!

On par with prodigies like Ning Xiaohui and Zheng Jian!

Was this really Ning Zhuo?

Was this still the Ning Zhuo he remembered?

"How did Little Zhuo pull it off? Is the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation really that suited for him?”

Full of doubt and curiosity, Ning Ze called out to his wife Wang Lan. "Prepare for a family dinner tonight. Pick a restaurant and order some spirit food."

Wang Lan was puzzled. "Ordering spirit food costs a lot. Husband, what’s the occasion? What are we celebrating?”

"Like I said, it’s a family dinner. Invite Little Zhuo over. Sigh, as his uncle, I haven’t seen him in so long," Ning Ze said.

Wang Lan's eyes widened and she shrieked, "What? Invite Little Zhuo for a meal? And order spirit food? Husband, have you gone mad?"

Ning Ze said sternly, "You’re just a woman, what do you know? This is a task given by the junior patriarch himself..."

He then briefly recounted what Ning Xiaoren had told him.

Wang Lan stood frozen for a long time after hearing it.

"Little Zhuo?

"You’re sure it’s Little Zhuo?!"

Ning Ze snorted coldly. "Would I lie to you? Would the junior patriarch lie to me? This all happened during the joint examination of the three clans. So many people witnessed it with their own eyes, how could it be fake?"

Wang Lan opened and closed her mouth several times, wanting to speak, but in the end said nothing.

Her eyes were wide, and her expression was extremely complicated. There was disbelief, denial, unwillingness, jealousy, and disappointment...

Ning Ze’s face sank. "What are you thinking about? Hurry up and prepare."

Wang Lan responded, "Alright, alright, husband, I’ll get it done."

She turned to leave. Her gaze was still vacant, her walking was stiff, and her demeanor as a whole was lost and dispirited.

Once no one was around, Ning Ze also let out a long sigh.

Ning Xiaoren had ordered him to win over Ning Zhuo and try and extract some information from him.

In the sixteen years of Ning Zhuo’s life, this was the first time Ning Ze had lowered himself to invite his nephew for a meal.

Ning Ze was someone who valued his pride above all. This kind of order made him feel awful. Where was his dignity as a senior?

But he had no choice.

The junior patriarch had given the order himself, and he could only obey.

Of course, his rational side also told him that Ning Zhuo was no longer who he used to be. Building a good relationship with him would be beneficial.

…

After leaving the Zhou Clan, many people walked with Ning Zhuo for a long while, even though it wasn’t on their way at all.

At the final junction, Ning Zhuo proactively bade farewell to them, keeping only Ning Chen and Ning Yong by his side.

Once he got home, he even invited Ning Chen and Ning Yong into his house for tea and a short chat.

Though it was only a brief conversation, both Ning Chen and Ning Yong left feeling greatly honored. As they went on their way, their faces were flush with excitement and they continuously praised Ning Zhuo, saying how he hadn’t grown arrogant after becoming famous and still treated people sincerely.

Meanwhile, Ning Zhuo waited patiently. It wasn’t long before the invitation from Ning Ze arrived.

"It’s not a personal summons from the Ning Clan patriarch, or even from the junior patriarch Ning Xiaoren?"

Ning Zhuo sneered inwardly, but on the surface, he sincerely thanked the messenger. He smiled warmly and said that he would definitely attend on time.

The family dinner was lavish.

In sixteen years, Ning Zhuo had never eaten such good food at Ning Ze’s place.

Even with so much spirit food in front of her, Wang Lan hardly ate a bite. Moreover, she barely spoke during the dinner, completely unlike her usual garrulous self. When she glanced surreptitiously at Ning Zhuo, it was as if his whole body was radiating blinding light; just a look made her feel like her heart was being pierced.

Ning Ji also found the food tasteless.

For him, all of this had happened far too suddenly.

Ning Ze’s expression remained calm. The authority of a senior that he had carried for sixteen years wasn’t something he could put down just like that.

Ning Zhuo didn’t eat much either. Every time Ning Ze asked a question, he would put down his cup or chopsticks and reply respectfully. His answers were brief and concise, clearly unwilling to say more, and he maintained a distant attitude.

Ning Ze knew very well that he needed to smile, to bow his head, to be more conciliatory.

But even after the dinner ended and Ning Zhuo left, he hadn’t managed to do so.

Ning Ji quietly followed behind Ning Zhuo.

He didn’t even know why he was doing this.

Maybe it was the doubts in his heart.

"How could he cultivate to the peak of the third level? It doesn’t make sense!

"Is it really just that the technique suits him that well?

"No, I have to investigate. He must have some sort of secret!!"

"You followed me?" Ning Zhuo had already noticed Ning Ji behind him and deliberately slowed down to make it easier for him to keep up.

Under Ning Ji’s watchful eyes, Ning Zhuo visited many pill stores, purchasing large quantities of cultivation pills.

Ning Ji was shocked. "How is he so rich?! Richer than my father?

"Even though he’s revealed his cultivation base, the clan resources haven’t been distributed yet. Even if they had, it wouldn’t be this many spirit stones.

"This money isn’t clean, it must be illicit!!

"I have to report this!"

Overjoyed, Ning Ji hurried home to report everything to Ning Ze.

Ning Xiaoren learned of the situation even earlier than Ning Ze. After instructing Ning Ze to win Ning Zhuo over, he had immediately sent a team of cultivators to secretly protect Ning Zhuo's safety. Of course, they were also there to monitor him and report back with any changes.

"Ning Zhuo actually possesses such a huge sum of money?" Ning Xiaoren stared at the paper in his hand in disbelief.

This paper listed all the kinds of medicinal pills that Ning Zhuo had recently bulk purchased.

Ning Xiaoren's eyes were practically spitting fire as he read. "If I knew Ning Zhuo was this wealthy, I would've gotten close to him sooner.

"Did his parents secretly leave it for him?

"Or is this dirty money from an illicit source? Perhaps he’s being secretly supported by a demonic cultivator?"

Ning Xiaoren paced back and forth in his study.

As his thoughts churned, the fire of greed in his heart burned brighter and hotter.

"Ning Zhuo is from the branch family, yet he already has the same cultivation base as Ning Xiaohui. Now he also has a vast fortune at his disposal...

"This large sum of money has an unclear origin. For the sake of the clan, I must investigate it thoroughly."

"Besides, I won’t need to act personally. I can just let Ning Ze do it. That would be quite fitting, wouldn't it?"

Finally, he stopped walking and called out to the door, "Someone, come!"

A servant immediately pushed the door open and entered.

One hour later, Ning Ze and Ning Fan[^1] led a group of cultivators to surround Ning Zhuo’s small courtyard.

Ning Ze frowned tightly. "Do we really have to do this? This isn’t appropriate."

Ning Fan said, "Didn’t Sir Junior Patriarch give you clear instructions? The recultivation team concerns a matter as significant as Lava Immortal Palace, and we can’t afford any oversight.

“Ning Zhuo’s large fortune has an unknown origin. As his biological uncle, it is your duty to take action.

"The clan may need rely on Ning Zhuo in the future. You are his blood relative, so you’re the most suitable person to do this.

"Now go."

Ning Ze was from the branch family, while Ning Fan was from the main family. The latter had been sent specially by Ning Xiaoren to supervise the whole matter.

With no choice, Ning Ze sighed and knocked on the courtyard gate.

Ning Zhuo opened the gate, greeted them respectfully, and asked why they had come.

"Let’s speak inside," Ning Ze said with a solemn expression. Without waiting for an invitation, he stepped inside the courtyard.

The people behind him filed in one by one, pushing Ning Zhuo to the side near the gate.

At the same time.

The three clan leaders met again in secret to continue negotiations.

This time, they were going to finalize the distribution of benefits among the three clans.

"Phoenix Soul Blood Fragrance Pellets are extremely effective for restoring soul power. They should be distributed equally among the three clans."

"No way," the Ning Clan patriarch objected. "Our clan has Ning Xiaohui and Ning Zhuo, two prodigies. We have to make sure they have enough resources, right? The Zheng Clan only has one prodigy to think about.”

The Zheng Clan patriarch immediately snorted coldly. "That Ning Zhuo just matches well with the technique. He has no real innate talent. What kind of prodigy is that? He doesn't count!"

Just then, a knock suddenly came at the door.

The pupils of the three clan leaders contracted sharply, and their hearts jolted.

"Who is it?"

"It’s me, Zhu Xuanji!"

"Ah, so it’s Sir Divine Investigator." The three clan leaders quickly opened the door and welcomed Zhu Xuanji in.

They had arranged for subordinates to guard outside, but to a Golden Core cultivator, this kind of defense was completely meaningless.

Zhu Xuanji wore a pleasant smile. "Patriarchs, I’ve come this time to request something."

Zhu Xuanji had already acquired detailed records from the City Lord and read up on the all cultivators who had entered the Lava Immortal Palace over the years.

But those were just the records from the City Lord Mansion.

Zhu Xuanji now hoped to gather similar records from each of the three great clans in order to piece together a more complete version.

All three clan leaders were still at the Foundation Establishment stage. Given that they were united in opposing the City Lord Mansion, in some respects, their interests aligned with those of the royal family.

The three patriarchs immediately ordered their people to fetch the relevant records and handed them over to Zhu Xuanji.

Most of the content came from the Zheng and Zhou Clans. The Ning Clan had only discovered the Lava Immortal Palace this year, so their records were rather sparse.

Zhu Xuanji glanced through them and nodded repeatedly, clearly satisfied.

As a member of the royal family, he had no desire to see Meng Kui and Meng Chong seize Lava Immortal Palace and allow the Meng Clan’s influence to expand again.

Thus, before leaving, he offered a suggestion. "I heard a familiar name when I arrived. If you're referring to Ning Zhuo, then that kid is worth nurturing.

"His character still needs observation, but he has some talent in mechanical arts.

"The explosive fire monkey was designed and created by him."

The three clan leaders widened their eyes in unison, shock spreading across their faces.

The Ning Clan patriarch opened his mouth. "What?!"

Zhu Xuanji smiled faintly. "Publicly, the credit is given to the Flying Disk Workshop’s Chen Cha, but there’s more behind the scenes. Actually, it involves Fei Si. If you investigate, you’ll understand."

These few words were enough explanation.

Zhu Xuanji waved his hand and disappeared on the spot, leaving the three patriarchs staring at one another.

Gradually, the Ning Clan patriarch slightly raised his head and exhaled heavily. His face was full of joy. "Did you both hear that clearly? Sir Zhu Xuanji said it himself!"

The Zhou and Zheng Clan patriarchs momentarily fell silent.

Basking in delight, the Ning Clan patriarch had no idea that Ning Zhuo was currently being subjected to intense interrogation in his very own clan.
