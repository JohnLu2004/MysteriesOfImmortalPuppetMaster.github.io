Chapter 605: The Path of the Dao

The next moment, the paper figure moved more violently.

A cold wind swept through, stirring up the surrounding paper soldiers. Their bodies trembled and swayed in the gust.

Then the wind vanished.

And the paper figures froze in place once more.

Sun Lingtong dropped to his knees, utterly spent. The paper shell he had possessed disintegrated, and his soul appeared dim and frail, nearly passing out on the spot.

It took him quite some time to recover. Still shaken, he muttered, “No good, Little Zhuo.”

“It takes far too much mastery of mechanisms to control this paper army.”

“This just isn’t my strength. It’s your domain - you’ll have to do it!”

Sun Lingtong had tried, but couldn’t even complete the first step in activating the paper army.

Ning Zhuo, who had been observing everything through Life Hanging by a Thread, said thoughtfully, “Boss, your soul and body are separated - this isn’t your full strength. It’s normal that you can’t manage it.”

“Besides, my mother set up this place. She had high standards.”

“Even I might not be able to activate the whole army myself.”

“So, maybe just try controlling a portion?”

Sun Lingtong, now steadier, gave it another shot. This time, he started small and worked step by step, expanding gradually and steadily.

Ning Zhuo’s suggestion worked.

At first, Sun Lingtong managed to control three spear-and-shield infantry.

Once activated, they transformed just like the paper body he had previously possessed - becoming lifelike ghosts, vivid and animated. Neither Sun nor Ning could spot a single flaw in their appearance.

Ning Zhuo offered another timely suggestion: “Boss, prioritize the cavalry.”

Sun Lingtong agreed without hesitation.

There was only one type of cavalry among the paper soldiers, so the two had no choices to weigh.

Moments later, Sun Lingtong was riding a ghostly ox, with twelve mounted warriors behind him, charging out from their hidden location.

The ghost ox was massive, its pitch-black hide as dense and dark as the night sky of the underworld. Its horns were sharp as blades, and its eyes gleamed with a cold, eerie light. Every step it took sent a deep rumble through the ground.

Sun Lingtong gripped the reins tightly. As the ox galloped, his body naturally synced with its rhythm. He could clearly feel the beast’s immense power beneath him, and his heart grew steadier with every stride.

The ghost ox’s speed far outpaced his own on foot.

The wind rushing past carried the chill and rot unique to the underworld.

The land was vast and desolate, dotted occasionally with drifting remnants of souls and flickering shadows.

The ground was slick and hard, but the ox’s hooves crushed the jutting rocks underfoot without breaking stride, its path sure and unstoppable.

Each thundering hoofbeat sent tremors through the earth, as though the very land acknowledged its power.

His mount had been crafted as a set with his paper form. It moved with seamless coordination, responding instantly to his commands - be it to turn, speed up, or leap.

“Though my connection to the other riders isn’t nearly as strong.”

Sun Lingtong glanced behind him. These twelve ghost ox cavalry were the maximum he’d been able to summon so far.

Ning Zhuo offered another reminder at just the right moment. “Boss, might as well train your control while you travel. See how far you can push it - better than fumbling around mid-battle.”

Sun Lingtong had the same idea - and to his surprise, the results were far better than expected.

The key was that once these paper soldiers transformed into ghostly beings, they retained full spiritual intelligence and obeyed his commands with absolute precision.

“If you were the one doing this, Little Zhuo, you could probably control ten times as many troops as I can!”

“But no… the Underworld is too dangerous. I can’t let you take that risk.”

With that thought, Sun Lingtong focused again on the Heaven-bestowed Talisman tucked inside his robes. Even as he traveled, he activated the talisman, steadily nurturing and strengthening his soul.

Cultivating on ox-back - this was a first for Sun Lingtong.

But it wasn’t difficult.

For one thing, a bull’s back was far more stable than a horse’s. For another, he wasn’t practicing a delicate foundational art. He was simply drawing on the talisman to nourish his soul, a process that required far less focus and effort.

Ning Zhuo spoke up again: “Boss, why not send a few riders out ahead as scouts?”

Sun Lingtong took the suggestion readily.

Not long after the cavalry unit set off, one of the scouts returned with fresh intel.

A small pack of Corpsefang Wolves had been spotted nearby, mid-hunt.

Sun Lingtong’s eyes lit up at once.

Ning Zhuo immediately urged him to lead the cavalry to engage and test their combat strength.

Exactly what Sun Lingtong had in mind!

Without hesitation, he issued orders to change direction and head toward the wolves’ hunting ground.

The Wolf King stood atop a slope, overseeing the battlefield. Every so often it howled, sending out sharp commands to adjust the pack’s formation.

A herd of skeletal white deer struggled bitterly below. Their leader, the Stag King, was already gravely wounded.

The Wolf King saw its moment - and leapt!

Its claws tore through the air like blades, and its fangs shimmered with the ghostly glow of the underworld.

The Stag King, already at the end of its strength, couldn’t guard against the ambush. The Wolf King’s jaws clamped down on its throat.

But the stag fought back with all it had. Its antlers, like a crown of bone, drove upward and pierced deep into the Wolf King’s abdomen - one antler tip even punched through and jutted from the beast’s back.

“What a chance!” Sun Lingtong reached the edge of the battlefield just in time to see this clash. He shouted, “Charge!”

He spurred his mount into a full gallop, and the ghost ox cavalry followed without hesitation.

The Wolf King’s pupils shrank. With a furious snarl, it thrashed to tear free of the antlers and let out a piercing howl, rallying its pack to intercept the incoming riders.

The wolves had no choice but to abandon their almost-won prey and turn on the ghost ox cavalry.

The oxen bellowed deep and low. Hooves thundered like a war drum. With Sun Lingtong at the tip of the formation, the riders formed a sharp wedge and accelerated again.

Just before impact, the ghost oxen lowered their heads in unison, horns aimed dead ahead. The cavalry leveled their long spears.

Thud. Crash. Smash...

One by one, the Corpsefang Wolves were torn to pieces, their bodies shattered and scattered.

The wolf pack’s formation collapsed in an instant. The ghost ox cavalry tore through them like a landslide.

In the blink of an eye, the pack was annihilated - only the heavily wounded Wolf King remained.

It let out a mournful cry and tore itself free. But instead of retaliating, it turned and fled.

“Hahaha! After it!” Sun Lingtong shouted.

The cavalry gave chase.

Though wounded, the Wolf King still had speed on its side. As it fled, it unleashed ghostly techniques and tucked its tail, darting forward with such startling swiftness that even Sun Lingtong was taken aback.

“Ah, what a shame to lose a Wolf King…” In the end, Sun Lingtong could only sigh with regret. The beast had escaped.

Still, it had been a fruitful first battle.

Both Sun and Ning were impressed by the ghost ox cavalry’s combat power. But they also identified a key flaw: while the ox cavalry excelled in heavy charges and devastating impact, their effectiveness dropped sharply during long-distance pursuits. The longer the ride, the slower the charge - and with it, their fighting strength declined.

With the cavalry tested, Sun Lingtong pressed on toward his destination.

He had only one goal: the Water Burial Valley.

Meng Yaoyin hadn’t offered Ning Zhuo any concrete plan, only laid out a framework. But she had named one crucial figure - Ash Bone Elder.

Given that this man was said to possess both divination skill and spiritual insight - and coupled with Luo Si’s prior connection to Sun Lingtong - Sun and Ning agreed they should pay him a visit first in hopes of finding a solution.

In White Paper Immortal City.

At Vigorous Yang Manor.

Sun Tiesheng was led into a small courtyard by a paper puppet attendant.

“Greetings, Lord Li,” he said respectfully, bowing toward Li Xiangshang.

Then he turned to another cultivator seated nearby. “Greetings, Director Zhao.”

Director Zhao, who oversaw Vigorous Yang Manor, smiled and gestured toward Sun Tiesheng as he introduced him to Li Xiangshang.

“Lord Li, this young man here - Sun Tiesheng - is without a doubt the most promising talent our Vigorous Yang Manor has to offer.”

“You’ve got a keen eye, choosing him at a glance!”

Li Xiangshang gave a nod. Most of his face remained hidden beneath his wide-brimmed hat, making it impossible to read his expression.

Sun Tiesheng felt his heartbeat quicken. “Could this be my great opportunity?” he wondered.

Li Xiangshang silently studied him for a while.

When he had first arrived at Vigorous Yang Manor, he’d asked for the records of all members and carefully reviewed them before making his selection.

In the end, he had chosen Sun Tiesheng.

From his storage pouch, Li Xiangshang withdrew a treasure and presented it to the two others.

Sun Tiesheng’s eyes locked on the object, heart burning with anticipation.

It was only palm-sized - shaped like a bird’s nest. Every strand of golden silk shimmered with five-colored light, and nestled in the center was a vivid crimson object, pulsing like a tiny heart - or perhaps a strange seed.

The entire golden nest radiated the aura of a demonic creature.

Li Xiangshang explained, “As you can see, this is a Golden Nest Demon Seed. It carries the bloodline of the Golden Swallow.”

“If you implant it using the secret method, not only will your yang energy surge, but you’ll also gain the blood of a Golden Swallow demon!”

“With that, your chances of obtaining the Golden Swallow Fork rise to at least seventy percent.”

Director Zhao was overjoyed, clapping his hands with laughter. “Excellent! Sun Tiesheng, your luck is incredible! To receive such support - you’d better accept quickly!”

But Sun Tiesheng’s expression changed drastically. The eagerness in his eyes faded, replaced by cold detachment. His heart was no longer aflame - it had turned to ice.

He slowly shook his head, his face heavy with resolve. “Forgive me, but I cannot accept this.”

Li Xiangshang let out a quiet grunt, clearly taken aback by the response.

Director Zhao gave a surprised cry and was just about to try persuading him, but Sun Tiesheng cut him off, raising his hands in a formal salute.

“If this is the only method, then I must decline. I take my leave.”

He glanced up at Li Xiangshang, who looked puzzled.

Sun Tiesheng saluted once more, turned, and walked out.

He left without looking back, leaving only Li Xiangshang and Director Zhao behind.

“…What’s this about?” Li Xiangshang turned to Director Zheng. “Does Sun Tiesheng have some hidden concern?”

Director Zheng gave an awkward smile.

Li Xiangshang pressed, “He’s by far the best candidate - why would he turn it down?”

With a bitter laugh, Director Zheng replied, “It’s likely because of the demon seed.”

Li Xiangshang let out a surprised grunt. “Why wouldn’t he want it?”

Director Zheng said, “Lord Li, you’re a man of cultivation, single-minded in your pursuit of the Dao. You might not be aware of the deeper issue. Sun Tiesheng is a pureblood human. If he were to absorb an external demon seed and become half-human, half-demon, it would definitely diminish his future prospects.”

Realization dawned on Li Xiangshang. “Humans are the spirits of all living beings. I, being pure demon myself, have spent nearly a lifetime in cultivation just to reach this point and be entrusted with duties by my lord. I hadn’t considered this.”

“If Sun Tiesheng refuses, then what? Am I supposed to pick someone else?”

“I’ve seen your roster. He’s the only one whose cultivation is even close to the Golden Core realm.”

Director Zheng chuckled and waved his hand. “Sun Tiesheng’s stance is just a personal one - it’s not the end of the road. Lord Li, why not start with the Sun family?”

Li Xiangshang blinked. “What do you mean?”

Director Zheng hadn’t expected to have to explain something so obvious, but given Li’s status, he held back his impatience and clarified patiently.

“The Sun family is a cultivation clan here in Immortal City. They’re counting on Sun Tiesheng obtaining the Golden Swallow Fork to secure their standing.”

“He was handpicked and supported by the clan. Originally, he was of very humble birth - the illegitimate son of a blacksmith.”

“If we approach the Sun family and explain the stakes, they’ll be the ones to convince their boy.”

Li Xiangshang slapped his thigh. “Brilliant! This way we don’t offend anyone, and it saves us the trouble. My lord entrusted this task to me - turns out there’s a method to all things. I’ve learned something today. Thank you, Brother Zheng.”

Director Zheng, being only at the Foundation Establishment level, quickly cupped his hands in humility. “I wouldn’t dare.”

Once the plan was settled, the two immediately arranged a banquet and invited the Sun family patriarch.

The patriarch, seeing both Director Zheng and a Golden Core cultivator like Li Xiangshang extending the invitation, gladly accepted.

During the banquet, after learning the situation, he pounded his chest and, emboldened by drink, swore to the two of them that he would make Sun Tiesheng comply.

“That bastard child owes everything to the clan! If we hadn’t looked past his origins and raised him up, he wouldn’t have made it this far!”

“If he dares refuse, then he’ll be stricken from the family register - no ancestral tablet in the shrine after death!”

The patriarch shouted so at the table.

After returning to the clan, he immediately summoned Sun Tiesheng’s father.

Sun’s father, without delay, called his son back to the ancestral grounds to confess his mistake.

But before both patriarch and father, Sun Tiesheng shed his usual reticence. His face was grim as iron, and he refused on the spot.

His tone was resolute. “Absolutely not.”

“Using a demon seed is a shortcut. It might benefit the clan, it might even serve the greater good of White Paper Immortal City - but it does nothing for me.”

“If it means compromising my future potential, I’d rather pass on this so-called opportunity.”

Neither the patriarch nor his father had ever been defied like this. Both flushed with anger and embarrassment.

Sun’s father scolded him harshly.

But Sun Tiesheng stood tall, hands clasped behind his back, and coldly replied, “This is a matter of the Dao. I will not compromise.”

Seeing the righteous force in his son’s bearing, Sun’s father found himself at a loss, his rebuke caught in his throat.

The patriarch, as if seeing Sun Tiesheng for the first time, was left speechless. He could only wave him away, telling him to withdraw.

Only Sun Tiesheng’s father remained behind with the patriarch. A heavy silence settled between them.

After a long while, the patriarch finally spoke. “Never thought our Sun clan would produce a child as noble and exceptional as a qilin.”

His face flushed with emotion. He stepped forward and cupped his hands in apology. “I was short-sighted in this matter. I handled it poorly. Please forgive me.”

Sun’s father quickly waved his hands. “Truth be told, this is the first time I’ve truly seen that brat’s true nature.”

The patriarch gave a rare word of praise. “And it’s a fine nature.”

“In this entire generation of the Sun clan, he’s the only one with such resolve.”

“In the future, if anyone is to carry the weight of the Sun family, it must be him.”

Sun’s father hurried to demur, saying the patriarch placed too much faith in his son.

The patriarch’s tone turned contemplative. “Given how things stand, with Chen Sui and Shen Bing both dead, Tiesheng has no rival left at Vigorous Yang Manor.”

“Even if that Li Xiangshang wants to give the demon seed to someone else - who could he give it to?”

“There’s no one else.”

“Which means there’s room to maneuver. Space for negotiation.”

“To tell the truth, I too would rather not see the Sun family’s future standard-bearer become half-human, half-demon.”

 - 

Underworld.

Water Burial Valley.

Sun Lingtong and his squad of bull-riders had just arrived in the area when they were suddenly surrounded by ambushers.

“Seize those suspicious intruders!” the enemy commander shouted.

Sun Lingtong was shocked - their ambush was far too well-hidden. He hadn’t sensed a thing. By the time he realized it, it was already too late.

Desperate, he shouted back, “Who are you people? You dare ambush me!?”

The commander sneered. “Asking us? You’d be scared to death if I told you. We’re the personal guard of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord! Our lord has issued strict orders - no one is to approach Water Burial Valley!”

“Anyone who makes contact with the Ash Bone Elder is to be arrested on sight!”

 - 

Forgetful River Immortal City.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord sat in meditation, gazing into the skull of a ghostly spirit. His eyes were dark and fathomless.

A hundred years of planning - all of it was finally nearing fruition.

He would stamp out every adverse change while it was still in the cradle.

The blockade around Water Burial Valley and the isolation of the Ash Bone Elder were part of those preparations.

After all, the Ash Bone Elder knew too much.

Even if it meant offending this fortune-telling cultivator, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had no regrets.

“This is the path of my Dao.”
