Chapter 411.5: No Update Today, Adjusting Storyline Information

The storyline outline is getting messy again... Mainly, there will be a more reliable upgrade path for the upcoming storyline, leading to a surge in workload that far exceeds the plan.

I believe everyone can see that the first major arc had slight adjustments, and by the second arc, I've been continuously tweaking and gradually optimizing based on feedback, trying to improve everyone’s reading experience as much as possible.

Then, after each small segment of plot, there will be some summaries.

Writing techniques and creative rhythms are things that require a gradual process of change; they can't be altered just like that. I can only try to speed up and be more efficient.

I wonder how everyone feels about reading the second arc?

For the upcoming storyline, I will try to speed up the rhythm in some places. Therefore, I’ll have to spend a bit more effort on setting up the plot.
