Chapter 624: What Can't Be Forgotten is the Dao Path

The Underworld.

Forgetful River Immortal City.

The Forgetful River rumbled beneath the city, its waters flowing ceaselessly.

Dark-green bones grew slowly from the riverbed, accumulating through countless ages until they finally breached the surface, sprouting into countless spires.

The Forgetful River Immortal City was built upon these towering skeletal foundations, constructed above the waters of the Forgetful River!

The Mansion of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord stood atop the tallest bone spire.

He sat upon his throne, placing a jade slip on the table.

Within the jade slip lay a report from the vanguard commander, stating that the entire army was applying the Death Echo Cascade Ointment as scheduled, preparing for the final assault.

"Nearly a century has passed in the blink of an eye... We've reached the final threshold..." The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's gaze softened.

Unconsciously, he rose and approached the window, gazing out over the Forgetful River Immortal City.

This was the city's highest point.

The yin wind blew across the bones, carrying whispers of rust and soul, stirring the pale hair of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord.

He stood tall and gaunt in black robes, hands clasped behind his back as he surveyed the Immortal City before turning his gaze to the distant horizon.

His face bore the marks of time, with deep creases radiating from the corners of his eyes and along his cheekbones.

His eyes were like dark abysses, their depths holding countless twisted faces that silently wailed, laughed maniacally, and then vanished. Scenes of life and death, love and hatred, played out within those pupils like fleeting visions.

His lips were thin and cold as if carved from stone. Two deep furrows ran from the sides of his nose down to the corners of his mouth, resembling shackles that sealed away a thousand unspoken words.

The resentment of time, the weight of loneliness, the exhaustion of seeking the Dao... all these emotions had etched themselves into the lines on his face, leaving behind a will more ancient and stubborn than death itself.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord understood the situation clearly: "To refine the Heavenly Ghost Skull, I've initiated the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual."

"My archenemies and powerful neighbors must have realized by now," he thought. "Even if they don't know the nature of the Acquired Talent within the Heavenly Ghost Skull, they can discern its value to me from my grand actions."

"Therefore, they will undoubtedly act to prevent my path down this Dao!"

Just as this thought crossed his mind, an urgent report arrived from a subordinate:

"My Lord Prefect, turmoil has erupted on the Bone Transformation Frontier. The Spore Cult and Corpse Lord are in conflict, with both sides mobilizing forces at full speed. The situation is deteriorating rapidly and requires immediate mediation."

"If we don't intervene promptly, these two major powers may escalate to full-scale war!"

The subordinate gazed at the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord with a mixture of reverence and anticipation.

The Prefecture Lord remained gazing out the window, thinking to himself: "So you two are the first to come seeking trouble."

The Spore Cult Patriarch and Corpse Lord had always been at odds, with frequent clashes between their factions. The Bone Transformation Frontier, where their territories lay, was under the jurisdiction of the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord. Consequently, he often personally intervened to mediate their disputes.

Whichever side appeared weaker, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord would secretly support.

Through his balancing strategy, the Bone Transformation Frontier maintained a fragile equilibrium, with no major power dominating the region.

Now that both factions saw the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord preoccupied with refining the Heavenly Ghost Skull, they tacitly mobilized their forces, positioning themselves to annihilate the other and establish dominance in the area!

Even though the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had discerned their schemes, he had to acknowledge that these two had seized this rare opportunity with remarkable precision.

This time, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord truly couldn't personally intervene to mediate!

"This is an even more appropriate test."

"After I confirmed I wouldn't personally go to the frontier, their backup plans have begun unfolding one after another."

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had already anticipated the subsequent developments.

Yang Realm.

White Paper Immortal City.

The City Lord Clone led Ning Zhuo and Qing Chi to the city's treasury.

"This is the Bone Blade Battle Flag," the City Lord Clone first displayed a military banner.

The banner's pole was neither wood nor metal, but countless small pale bones tightly assembled. At the top, instead of a spear tip, there burned a mass of yin fire, its flames a ghastly green.

The flag itself was so thin it seemed nearly transparent, as if crafted from the skin peeled from the dead. It was icy to the touch, yet strangely smooth. The surface remained blank, devoid of any design, until refined by Qing Chi, at which point the characters "Qing Jiao" would appear in bold letters.

"These are the Crescent Moon Greatsword and Void-Piercing Spear," the City Lord Clone continued.

The Crescent Moon Greatsword was as thin as a cicada's wing, its blade not smooth but covered in intricate cracks resembling shattered ice patterns. Deep within these fissures, a pale blue moonlight flowed slowly, flickering between light and darkness.

The Void-Piercing Spear's tip was formed from layers of talisman paper tightly rolled, compressed, and bonded together. While the point remained sharp, the midsection exhibited a loose, almost disintegrating texture.

When Ning Zhuo swung the spear, he heard a tearing sound reminiscent of ripping paper.

"These are Black Blood Paper Horses."

The paper horses stood tall and gaunt, their skeletons constructed from hardened black paper rolls. The "flesh" consisted of translucent gray-white talisman paper, so thin that within their chests could be seen a human-head-sized mass of violently pulsating green ghost fire serving as their driving core.

At the position of their eyes, two deep pools of congealed ink lay, empty and deathly silent.

Finally, they reached the deepest recesses of the warehouse, where a dainty paper barracks stood no larger than a palm.

The City Lord's introduction was brief: "This is a Ceremonial Barracks. It allows Cultivation armies to avoid the pain and complexity of setting up camp in the wilderness. By simply invoking it, you can instantly erect a barracks on any flat surface."

"The key feature is the sacrificial altar within. It can be used to offer sacrifices to various ghosts and deities, and to pray."

"Of course, since we're fighting a defensive battle, we won't need this Ceremonial Barracks."

Yet a glint of interest flashed deep in Ning Zhuo's eyes.

The City Lord Clone extended her arm and traced a half-circle with her finger. "As you can see," she said, "these are all military weapons."

"Long ago, our city attempted to form a Cultivation army many times."

"These weapons were all prepared specifically for that purpose."

"Who could have imagined they would be used in this manner?"

The City Lord Clone looked at Ning Zhuo and Qing Chi.

She fervently hoped this New Army could be used by the White Paper Immortal City. However, the Qing-Jiao Army had already been thoroughly infiltrated by the Myriad Manifestations Sect. Fortunately, the outcome wasn't entirely disastrous.

Since Ning Zhuo was Meng Yaoyin's son and had not yet joined the Myriad Manifestations Sect, this familial connection could be leveraged to secure support.

On the other hand, Qing Chi, being a native Ghostman, fully endorsed White Paper Immortal City's rule.

Ning Zhuo sighed. "To be honest, I never imagined the army's establishment would progress so swiftly. We've already reached the stage of procuring military equipment."

"With your sponsorship, City Lord, the Qing-Jiao Army is now fully formed!"

The City Lord Clone replied, "This is no free gift. It comes at a price. If possible, consider it a loan. Our White Paper Immortal City plans to establish a new army in the future."

Qing Chi hastily responded, "Even as a loan, this would be tremendous assistance. This junior is deeply grateful!"

Ning Zhuo raised an eyebrow. "Establishing a new army for White Paper Immortal City seems rather challenging."

The Paper Doll Clone snorted coldly. "If only our city held sole authority, the new army would have been established long ago. Unfortunately, the Ghostly Black Marshlands lie between two nations, serving as a buffer zone. No one wants to see military forces stationed here!"

At this point, the Paper Doll Clone tilted her head back and sighed deeply. "Though the Ghostly Black Marshlands are vast and sparsely populated, with their peculiar environment, they're far from being a lawless frontier. Various powers will always be on guard, suppressing and marginalizing others. All manner of entanglements and obstacles will arise. Achieving anything significant here is incredibly difficult."

Qing Chi remained silent, unsure how to respond.

Ning Zhuo offered words of consolation. "City Lord, such is the nature of this world. It's not just White Paper Immortal City. Consider even the Two Note Kingdomâ€”a cultivation nation. They must scheme for years, planning three steps ahead for every move. To accomplish anything major, they must counter the interference of neighboring countries."

"Regardless of power or location, wherever Cultivators exist, there will be fierce competition. Isn't that so?"

In the Underworld...

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord was privately sighing. "Even as the ruler of a prefecture, achieving anything major remains impossibly difficult."

Ever since the standoff between the Spore Cult and the Corpse Lord began, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had refrained from intervening. Since then, reports of escalating conflicts and crises had poured in, requiring his constant attention and decision-making.

A formidable entity named Shan Yan roamed the Underworld, challenging the strongest warriors in every domain he visited.

He nearly made his way to the Forgetful River Prefecture.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord had been monitoring this situation and immediately dispatched forces to thwart the enemy's scheme, forcing Shan Yan to choose another path.

At the Dust Evil Cave, a Soul Transformation-level Dust Crocodile broke free from its seals, rampaging across the land and slaughtering entire villages.

The Forgetful River Prefecture reacted swiftly, but even their strongest cultivators returned defeated. Some never made it past bandit ambushes, sustaining heavy casualties that forced them to abandon the mission.

After prolonged consideration, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord finally ordered the deployment of the Border Army.

Though successful in eliminating the Dust Crocodile, the Border Army suffered significant losses and required immediate rest and recuperation.

This left the Forgetful River Prefecture's border defenses severely weakened, exposing vulnerabilities to neighboring powers.

"Urgent report!" The subordinate's face showed panic, yet unlike previous reports, there was a hint of joy in his expression.

"What is it?" The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord asked curiously.

"Your Excellency, the Cultivator you ordered to monitor White Tail Marsh has arrived at Dangkou!" the subordinate reported hastily.

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's expression momentarily grew distant.

"It's her..."

She was his former First Wife, to whom he had once been deeply devoted and promised to cherish through life's hardships.

Yet for the sake of his dao path, he had abandoned her, choosing instead the beloved daughter of the previous Monarch.

After usurping the throne, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord expanded his domain threefold. He sought out his First Wife, determined to welcome her back as Empress.

Her heart, long since shattered, had grown weary of love. She refused his offer outright.

She took refuge in White Tail Marsh, rarely venturing out.

At the marsh's entrance, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord stationed guards year-round, eager for any sign of his First Wife's appearance.

Whenever she showed herself, he would rush to meet her. Though greeted with cold rejection each time, he remained undeterred.

Through repeated attempts, even the coldest ice began to thaw.

The First Wife's attitude gradually softened. One day, she asked him, "Would you abandon me again?"

"I rule a prefecture and hold the Monarch's title. What could possibly make me forsake you now?" The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord gazed at her with unwavering devotion. "Return to me. Come back to my side."

A flicker of hesitation crossed her face. In the end, she shook her head and disappeared into the depths of White Tail Marsh.

Memories from the past surfaced in the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord's mind, only to be shattered by his fierce and venomous gaze.

"Someone must have secretly manipulated this timing, making my First Wife appear at Dangkou now!"

"What a poisonous scheme! They're trying to disrupt my Dao Heart."

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord was certain that if he didn't meet with his First Wife now, it would utterly disappoint her and make her see his true nature. Not only would decades of effort be wasted, but he might never get another chance!

The Forgetful River Prefecture Lord gritted his teeth, a rare ferocity twisting his features. His fists clenched until veins bulged on his knuckles. He wanted to roar in fury, to throw his head back and howl at the heavens, but in the end, he restrained himself.

He unclenched his fists, his expression turning cold as ice. He glanced at his reporting subordinate and said mildly, "You may withdraw."

Yang Realm.

White Paper Immortal City.

"You may all withdraw," Ning Zhuo said with a wave of his hand.

"As you command, Lord!" The Peanut Ghost General and the others responded in unison. They retreated several steps with utmost reverence before turning to leave the living room.

Only Ning Zhuo and Wen Ruanyu remained in the room.

Wen Ruanyu said, "I didn't just investigate these ghost generals. Even the City Lord's True Form personally examined them down to the last detail."

"They're trustworthy. There's no need for concern."

Previously, the Forgetful River Prefecture had dispatched Golden Core combatants through internal traitors to White Paper Immortal City, causing widespread destruction while capturing many of these ghosts alive.

After Zheng Shoumo's departure, Ning Zhuo took charge of recruiting these Golden Core-level Ghost Generals. Even these ghosts remained unaware of his true identity as an internal traitor.

The investigation revealed that Zheng Shoumo had followed proper procedures, diligently accepting the ghosts without setting any hidden traps or secret doors.

"These Ghost Generals are indeed useful, but they should be deployed primarily for city defense. Who knows what they might do if we send them back to the Underworld?"

Ning Zhuo considered mobilizing the Qing-Jiao Army. These Ghost Generals would serve as valuable reinforcements for the city's defenses.

The young man turned to Wen Ruanyu. "Senior Wen, have you made progress with the sacrificial text you were examining?"

This was the primary purpose of their meeting.

Wen Ruanyu replied, "Your guess was correct. This sacrificial text employs Confucian methodsâ€”it's a ritual to sacrifice to Heaven!"

"However, the sacrifice isn't for the Yang Realm, but for the Underworld."

"The text is fragmented and profound. I've only studied it partially, but I hope it can be of some help."

Ning Zhuo leaned closer to Wen Ruanyu. "This junior is all ears."

After explaining the text's nature, Wen Ruanyu concluded, "To break this ritual is actually simple. Locate the central point and use Confucian methods to disrupt it."
