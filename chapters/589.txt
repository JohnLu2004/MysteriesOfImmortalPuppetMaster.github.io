Chapter 589: Destiny Takes a Turn

After talking for a moment with the paper clone of the White Paper City Lord, Ning Zhuo returned to his residence in the Hidden Yang Manor, to rest for a while.

He took out the four treasures given to him by the White Paper City Lord, and observed them carefully.

The liquid of the Cold Bone Moon Dew Wine presented a translucent silver-grey color, if observed from the side, one could see a layer of pale moonlight shimmering on the surface of the liquid.

If the wine liquid was left undisturbed for a long time, fine suspended particles would condense from it, resembling bone fragments.

Ning Zhuo turned his mechanical finger ring, and tried to take a small sip.

The wine liquid entered his mouth, very clear, like snowmelt water. As it went down his throat, a warmth like a hot spring surged up. During the aftertaste, his mouth was filled with the cool fragrance of cedar and ice mint.

There were nearly a hundred sticks of the Nine Springs Requiem Incense, each one resembling a thin, withered twig, dark purple on the surface.

Ning Zhuo broke off a piece half a finger's length, and tried to light it.

The burning Nine Springs Requiem Incense produced green smoke straight as a hanging thread, both thin and long. Smelling it was like rotten earth mixed with damp, cold white plum blossoms.

The ash after burning still maintained the complete incense shape, upon slight contact with something possessing Yang energy, it would immediately transform from the state of ash into individual beads of black water dew. Smelling it at this time was like the deep, melancholic woody scent of a thousand-year-old coffin.

The Hungry Ghost Backlash Cauldron was taller than a person, a large bronze cauldron with three legs and two ears.

The body of the cauldron was covered in bronze rust, the corrosion forming blurry images of a hundred ghosts devouring each other. The inner wall of the cauldron retained dried, dark green ink marks, the three legs were wrapped in a layer of grey bone. The cauldron ears seemed to have a layer of dark brown patina, but upon closer inspection, it was countless overlapping layers of fingerprints and teeth marks.

The last item was the "Underworld Punishment Codex".

It was a book with an iron cover and iron pages, quite heavy.

The iron shell cover was dark as night, cast with black iron bands, faintly revealing the outline of the underworld. The spine was inlaid with a palace roof carved from black jade marrow, its form solemn.

The pages were all cold-rolled from thousand-forged cold iron, like thin blades, and emitted a ghostly green light.

On each page was intaglio-carved a type of punishment pattern, namely the oil cauldron, mountain of knives, tree of swords, sea of fire, mountain of ice, iron bed, heart gouging, tongue pulling, pit of oxen, grinding mill, sawing asunder, stone pressing, iron tree, bowel twisting, pool of blood, etc.

When opening the book, the iron pages struck against each other, producing the sound of clashing iron shackles.

Ning Zhuo merely needed to touch it with his finger, and his soul would feel different kinds of pain.

"These are all good treasures!" Sun Lingtong was also observing, his eyes shining.

Ning Zhuo nodded slightly, and put them away one by one.

He did not rush to use them, but instead began to ponder about the person, the White Paper City Lord.

Previously, the White Paper City Lord's calculations were obvious, simple and direct, causing both Sun and Ning to have some complaints and be on guard.

But after the meeting just now, Ning Zhuo found that this person acted quite magnanimously, saying things as they are.

"She could have secretly concealed the prophetic poem and such, hidden it all, not telling me. But she told me, and wasn't worried I would exploit the situation to raise the price."

"In fact, her generosity was considerable, not stingy at all. Just the Cold Bone Moon Dew Wine alone exceeded my highest expectations."

"She truly has the air of a heroine among women."

"Was it for this reason that Mother collaborated with the White Paper City Lord back then? Her feelings towards the White Paper City Lord, were they also the same as mine?"

"My mother was truly benevolent and magnanimous, she didn't even want the position of Vice City Lord... Compared to my mother, my own breadth of mind is far too lacking, I couldn't achieve such selflessness for others."

"Myriad Manifestations Sect... True Disciple..."

A knock on the door interrupted Ning Zhuo's thoughts.

The visitor was none other than Wen Ruanyu.

Now Ning Zhuo knew clearly, this person was his mother Meng Yaoyin's junior martial brother from the same sect, at the Golden Core level, also a True Disciple.

The Myriad Manifestations Sect was a super sect, similar in status to the Soul Devouring Sect and the Void Sect, to become a True Disciple of such a power, the minimum cultivation level had to be Golden Core!

"Coming." Ning Zhuo got up, and opened the door.

He was not at all surprised by Wen Ruanyu's proactive visit. It was all because the White Paper City Lord had previously given clear instructions, telling him to cooperate with Wen Ruanyu to investigate the spies within the upper echelons.

Wen Ruanyu cupped his hands towards him, smiling: "I will fully cooperate with Fellow Daoist Jiao Ma, to accomplish this important task!"

Since Ning Zhuo captured three Golden Core level Ghost Generals alive, his attitude and tone towards Ning Zhuo had become very equal.

This time, he was even personally instructed by the White Paper City Lord, telling him to assist Ning Zhuo.

This made Wen Ruanyu's posture even lower, implicitly regarding himself as Ning Zhuo's deputy.

This person was a Confucian cultivator, regardless of his inner thoughts, at least his outward attitude was very proper, very appropriate.

Ning Zhuo also cupped his hands in return, and sent a divine sense transmission to Wen Ruanyu, telling him: let's not alert the enemy, this identity of Jiao Ma if possible should be maintained. 

In the future, he himself would act under the identity of Jiao Ma, following Wen Ruanyu to investigate the spies with Wen Ruanyu taking the lead.

Wen Ruanyu pondered for a moment. This was a mature and prudent move, his evaluation of Ning Zhuo rose slightly again and he readily agreed.

He asked Ning Zhuo where they should start the investigation next.

Ning Zhuo did not hesitate and sent him a divine sense transmission: "I have already thought it through preliminarily, let's go check the south of the city first."

Arriving at the Southern gate, Ning Zhuo once again saw the giant paper figure, as well as the numerous cultivators actively clearing the battlefield.

Ning Zhuo: "I need to see the various arrangements made by Senior Meng Yaoyin back then."

Wen Ruanyu then followed Ning Zhuo's secret instructions, first ordering all other cultivators present to withdraw, leaving only the two of them. Then he activated the formation for Ning Zhuo, for them to entered the formation space together.

Here, Ning Zhuo saw the true structure of the formation, so complex and intricate that it made his head spin.

"Mother is truly amazing!"

"In terms of formation arrangement, her attainment is too profound, I simply cannot understand it in such a short time."

Ning Zhuo secretly communicated with Sun Lingtong, wearing an expression of reverence and admiration.

Sun Lingtong chuckled softly, thinking to himself: Wasn't this formation designed jointly by your mother and the White Paper City Lord, spending seven days and seven nights?

Sun Lingtong completely understood Ning Zhuo's thouhgts, and didn't ruin his mood.

Meng Yaoyin was a Golden Core True Disciple of a super sect, proficient in mechanical arts, naturally she was proficient in many cultivation techniques. Unfortunately, she passed away early, only leaving Ning Zhuo a book on the classics of mechanical arts.

Ning Zhuo did not inherit her foundation in formations, couldn't understand the formation here, but he had his own methods.

"Senior Wen, please explain the structure within for me." Ning Zhuo directly made the request.

Wen Ruanyu immediately explained patiently to Ning Zhuo, holding nothing back, telling him everything he knew.

Ning Zhuo's foundation in formations was solid, he barely understood two or three tenths of it, and made an accurate judgment in his heart: "Mother personally arranged this place back then, if the various arrangements of this formation were burned using the Fire Cremation Prajna Spirit-Resolving Sutra, I should be able to gain quite a bit of spirituality."

After examining the formation, Ning Zhuo said to Wen Ruanyu again: "Let's go take a look inside the giant paper figure."

Wen Ruanyu naturally had no objections.

----
Underworld.

Deep within the Water Burial Valley.

Ash Bone Elder sat cross-legged, slowly opened his eyes, gazing with a complex expression at the piece of skullcap before him.

This was the skullcap of a Heavenly Ghost, a treasure material of the Void Refining level!

Now, the surface of the skullcap had been refined by the Prefecture Lord until it melted like liquid, but the inside remained stubborn bone matter.

"No wonder, Prefecture Lord, you spared no expense, painstakingly refining this piece of Heavenly Ghost bone."

"This superior innate talent complements you perfectly, Prefecture Lord, no, it seems almost a match made in heaven."

The Prefecture Lord laughed heartily: "If it weren't so, why would I go to such great lengths?"

After obtaining this skullcap, he studied it carefully, and discovered nearly half a divine ability remained within it. After painstakingly planning for over a hundred years, continuously investing manpower and resources, he finally saw signs of imminent success this year.

Within the Heavenly Ghost skullcap, only a small portion of bone matter remained.

As long as he completely refined it, the Prefecture Lord would be able to fully absorb it, adding a new innate talent to himself!

The Prefecture Lord sighed with emotion: "To obtain this innate talent, I have truly taken great pains. Just to obtain the Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual, it cost thirty percent of my prefecture's treasury, to trade for it from another prefecture."

Ash Bone Elder was silent for a moment, then said: "This ritual originates from Confucianism, sacrificing to Heaven and Earth, in the Underworld it is considered virtue, in the Yang world it is considered sin. Therefore, it has caused countless calamities and blood debts in White Paper Immortal City."

The Prefecture Lord sneered: "Those who achieve great things don't sweat the small stuff, I am a king of the Underworld, do I still need the morality of the Yang world?"

"White Paper Immortal City, I must eliminate it, the entire city will be used for a blood sacrifice, only then can my Heavenly Ghost Transformation ritual be completed!"

Ash Bone Elder sighed: "Therefore, this skullcap is the source of the calamity. I used the calamity Qi within it to perform the Calamity Ash Covering Divination technique, but I also calculated that you are still facing obstacles on your path to success."

The Prefecture Lord nodded slightly: "I know."

"To be able to absorb this skullcap, one must have the foundation of at least a million souls, and also possess sufficient baleful Qi, enough to withstand the impact of this external innate talent."

"I am the lord of a prefecture, my soul foundation already exceeds ten million, a million souls is not an obstacle."

"And by using the ghost tide to attack White Paper Immortal City, I can obtain the Qi of martial balefulness, to help me resist the impact."

Ash Bone Elder nodded slightly, then shook his head gently: "There is more."

"Hm?" The Prefecture Lord was surprised, then said, "Fellow Daoist Ash Bone Elder, can you calculate it for me?"

Ash Bone Elder shook his head: "I cannot. But I can offer the Prefecture Lord a reminder or two."

The Prefecture Lord cupped his hands: "Please, Fellow Daoist, do not hesitate to enlighten me."

Ash Bone Elder said: "It's actually simple, according to my divination techniques, in reality, the various obstacles are contests of fate."

"Prefecture Lord, you are the esteemed ruler of a prefecture, placed in the Yang world, you would naturally be the ruler of a nation, extraordinarily powerful and noble."

"But this Heavenly Ghost Transformation Sacrifice Ritual covers both the Yin and Yang realms. Your position in the Underworld is stable, unbreakable, but in the Yang world, it is a major shortcoming."

"To win in the Yang world, it is necessary to overcome the strongest currents of fate there, only then can success be achieved."

"And the currents of fate in the Yang world are obvious, first, the Ghostly Black Marshlands, second, White Paper Immortal City, third, the major super sects."

The Prefecture Lord laughed loudly: "These three, I have long had plans for. The City Overthrowing Alliance can handle the geographical advantage, the internal spies can handle the Immortal City, and I have already sown discord among the major super sects."

Hearing this, Ash Bone Elder slowly nodded: "The Prefecture Lord plans before acting, has schemed and accumulated for decades, acting meticulously. According to the current situation, success is a matter of natural progression."

"However, innate talent is something bestowed by Heaven. For mortals like us to seek any kind of acquired innate talent is always against the Heavenly Dao, it will certainly not be smooth sailing."

"Heaven's fate is the greatest, compared to Heaven, we are like mayflies, like ants, not worth mentioning."

"Therefore, Prefecture Lord, you absolutely must not be careless, perhaps Heaven has already brewed some variable, it just hasn't manifested yet."

The Prefecture Lord's smile faded, an expression of contemplation appearing on his face: "Fellow Daoist Ash Bone Elder, if that is the case, then if I find the variable in advance, and strangle it in the bud, wouldn't that achieve twice the result with half the effort?"

Ash Bone Elder said: "That is indeed the method of resolving calamities."

"First, one must find the variable, this point alone is already extremely difficult."

"Secondly, one must find the right time to resolve the variable. To resolve the calamity of fate, the timing must be just right, grasping the most precise moment is necessary."

"A little too early, the variable is eliminated, other variables will arise, perhaps more numerous, or perhaps stronger. A little too late, the variable itself will have already caused irreversible negative consequences."

The Prefecture Lord listened carefully, feeling greatly enlightened.

----
White Paper Immortal City.

The giant statue in the southern part of the city.

Ning Zhuo and Wen Ruanyu were exploring inside the giant statue.

"This is a mechanical creation, but it mainly uses the two cultivation arts of talisman making and paper crafting. Mother's mechanical skills are so robust, and possess such ingenious ideas, I am utterly incomparable!"

Ning Zhuo watched with surging emotions.

Although he was determined to study the art of mechanicals, he was still too young, his cultivation had just begun, so his foundation and level had much room for improvement.

At this moment, a flying letter entered the giant statue, landing in Wen Ruanyu's hand.

Wen Ruanyu swept it with his divine sense, his face showing joy: "Fellow Daoist Jiao Ma, good news. The City Lord herself personally acted, interrogating those three Golden Core Ghost Generals, and learned much. They all come from an Underworld prefecture force, its name is Forgetful River Prefecture!"

"Forgetful River Prefecture?" Ning Zhuo's expression changed slightly. "This is comparable to the power of a nation in the Yang world, the Prefecture Lord must be at the Soul Formation level, right?"

Wen Ruanyu nodded, but then comforted him: "Although that is the case, Yin and Yang are separated, the more powerful the Prefecture Lord is, the less likely it is for him to travel to the Yang world. Otherwise, if the Prefecture Lord were to act personally, our White Paper Immortal City would have been destroyed long ago, its people perished."

Ning Zhuo narrowed his eyes: "Previously, there were no Yin soldiers or Ghost Generals, but this ghost tide has this new situation. But from what I hear, Forgetful River Prefecture has been acting secretly for a long time?"

Wen Ruanyu nodded: "That's right. Although ghost tides are a normal phenomenon, they don't actually occur frequently. Forgetful River Prefecture, as early as decades ago, began acting secretly, fanning the flames for each ghost tide."

A fierce glint flashed in Ning Zhuo's eyes, he clenched his teeth inwardly, muttering in his heart: "Forgetful River Prefecture... Good, very good. It was you who made my mother sacrifice so much, even shortening her lifespan to protect the city."

He thought for a moment, and asked again: "Why would the Prefecture Lord of the Underworld plot to harm White Paper Immortal City decades ago? Could it be that he wants to leave the Underworld, risk universal condemnation, to scheme for the Yang world?"

Wen Ruanyu shook his head: "I don't know the details of that. However..."

"However what?" Ning Zhuo pressed.

Wen Ruanyu hesitated for a moment, then said: "Back then, Senior Sister Meng seemed to have found some clues, and had some speculations."

"What clues?" Ning Zhuo asked again.

Wen Ruanyu shook his head: "I only heard a single instruction from Senior Sister Meng. She left behind a secret stash, waiting for someone destined, it was an arrangement specifically targeting this matter."

Hearing about the secret stash again, Ning Zhuo continued to press.

Wen Ruanyu gave a wry smile: "I've been in White Paper Immortal City for so many years, always searching for this secret stash, and have never found anything. Sometimes I also wonder, perhaps this was a clever move by Senior Sister Meng to use people's hearts, motivating the city residents to actively participate in the city's defense, and there is no secret stash itself."

Ning Zhuo nodded, and continued to observe.

Sun Lingtong grew a bit impatient, and asked secretly: "Little Zhuo, you've been looking for half a day, have you found any clues about the spy?"

Ning Zhuo shook his head in his heart, speaking truthfully to Sun Lingtong: "Boss, I'm not Zhu Xuanji, how could I have any detective skills?"

"My purpose in coming here was just to see my mother's personal arrangements, and judge how much spirituality could be obtained by cremating them."

Sun Lingtong couldn't help but fall silent.

Ning Zhuo chuckled: "Consider defeat before considering victory, right? Huh?"

Sun Lingtong: "What's wrong?"

Ning Zhuo's tone of communication changed: "Boss, take a close look, isn't the mechanical arrangement here an application from my mother's classics?"

Sun Lingtong carefully discerned: "Indeed it is. It was your mother's original creation back then, quite ingenious, operating forward it has one set of effects. Operating in reverse, it has another kind of power."

"This application... let me think, there should be another hidden space here!"

"Little Zhuo!"

"Why do you think your mother arranged it like this?"

Ning Zhuo's heart trembled, he almost blurted out: "The secret stash?"
