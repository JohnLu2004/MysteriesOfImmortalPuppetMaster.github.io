Chapter 44: The Demonic Cultivators are Too Arrogant!

Fei Si was still unsure about Han Ming’s status in the Soul Devouring Sect. If capturing Han Ming ended up provoking some old freak, that would be real trouble.

More critically, there was the Lava Immortal Palace. Right now, the four forces – including the City Lord Mansion – were all doing their best to explore the immortal palace, and didn’t want to stir up trouble anywhere else.

Thus, Fei Si’s previous thoughts were along these lines: “Who cares? Sun Lie’s the one being bothered, not us. Won’t this matter be solved as long as Sun Lie can no longer bear it and leaves Fire Persimmon City on his own?”

The City Lord Mansion turning a blind eye caused Han Ming to grow more and more arrogant – all the way until she was taken down by Ning Zhuo.

To a certain extent, Sun Lie’s high tolerance for harassment and the City Lord Mansion’s perfunctory attitude could be considered to have greatly helped Ning Zhuo in his capture.

“This time is different.

“Han Ming actually attacked Meng Chong. This time, we must go all out to arrest her!

"Hmm...

"Let's catch Hanging-Hair Traveler first.

“Perhaps Han Ming will take the opportunity to escape from the city.”

Fei Si knew that he had no choice but to capture Han Ming at all costs. However, he didn’t want to take any risks. If he really did capture Han Ming, that would only lead to sleepless nights for him.

In comparison, Hanging-Hair Traveler was a much easier target.

“Hanging-Hair Traveler has always been close with Sun Lingtong.

“Sun Lingtong is a disciple of the Spaceless Sect. This major heterodox sect has always specialized in thievery.

“Then, could it be that the third demonic cultivator was Sun Lingtong?”

Fei Si quickly thought of this possibility, but had absolutely no intentions of verifying it.

Like Han Ming, Sun Lingtong was backed by a major sect. After living in Fire Persimmon Immortal City for more than ten years, he had long taken root and was a true local snake.

Touching him would be even more troublesome than touching Han Ming.

Fei Si ordered his subordinates to hunt down Hanging-Hair Traveler in the black market and arrest him.

But where was Hanging-Hair Traveler?

Not a trace of him was to be found!

After spending most of the day searching, the subordinates returned empty-handed.

Fei Si made quite a fuss scolding them harshly. A short while later, he picked up a bottle of medicinal pills and poured one out.

After swallowing it, a subtle change came over his sense of smell.

He sniffed lightly, catching a faint medicinal fragrance that lingered in the air.

“Han Ming, I hope you’ve seen the situation clearly and have left Fire Persimmon Immortal City by now.”

Fei Si personally set out, turning into a long arc of light and soaring into the sky above Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

Following the medicinal fragrance, he flew through the wind and clouds, passed over the walls of the immortal city, and arrived at the foot of the mountain.

Fei Si felt something was strange, and that feeling only grew stronger. In the end, he smelled an overwhelming fragrance and looked up to see a large bundle laying on the grass in Fire Persimmon Forest.

Obviously, this bundle contained the stolen medicinal pills.

Hovering in the air, Fei Si was cursing internally. “Damn it!”

His expression was extremely gloomy. “They didn’t even use a storage bag, they just wrapped them in cloth and tossed them into Fire Persimmon Forest.

“Arrogant, too arrogant!”

Fei Si felt extremely provoked.

However, he didn’t dare to enter the forest and pick up the bundle of pills.

After all, there was still the black shadow demonic cultivator hiding in Fire Persimmon Forest!

“This is probably bait to lure me into the forest.

“Sure enough, that black shadow demonic cultivator had accomplices.

“If it were Chi Dun, he would probably charge right in. But I’m not a reckless fool like him.”

With these thoughts in mind, Fei Si decisively turned around and left, flying all the way to the place above the volcano to meet with the Fire Persimmon City Lord.

He quickly reported everything.

Sitting cross-legged in the air, the Fire Persimmon City Lord nodded slightly. “It may not be an accomplice of the black shadow demonic cultivator.

“It could be that someone else framed them and is trying to mislead the city.”

If this was the case, the situation would actually be even worse.

Because that would mean that the major forces in the city had noticed something and were secretly targeting the City Lord Mansion.

Fei Si had previously proposed sending assassins to the geniuses of the Zhou Clan and Zheng Clan, and the City Lord had agreed.

This plan was carried out successfully, but it also made the City Lord feel a sense of urgency.

He had made arrangements for Sun Lie to help Meng Chong master the immortal talent of Ferocious Rushing Thunder as soon as possible. Sun Lie had reported his proposed method in advance, to which the City Lord had nodded in approval.

But he hadn’t expected that during this period of time, demonic cultivators would suddenly attack.

“They might not be real demonic cultivators.” The City Lord couldn’t help but have this suspicion.

After thinking for a moment, he said to Fei Si, “You did a good job. Those medicinal pills are nothing, and hunting down the demonic cultivators isn’t important either.

“Take your time arresting them. There’s no need to rush.

“As for Meng Chong, open up the treasury and give him plenty of heavenly materials and earthly treasures. After all, using Ferocious Rushing Thunder requires heavy consumption of the essence, qi, and spirit.”

This was one of the reasons that the City Lord had always left Meng Chong on his own before.

He knew his grandson’s personality well. Once Meng Chong fully mastered Ferocious Rushing Thunder, he would definitely start using it continuously.

Ferocious Rushing Thunder was extremely effective, but it was also very easy to overuse. Meng Chong could easily end up damaging his foundation and future prospects.

But not long ago, the City Lord had felt pressure from the other two forces and worried that they would surpass him in the contest for the Lava Immortal Palace, so he changed his mind.

With the help of Sun Lie, Meng Chong successfully mastered his excellent talent of Ferocious Rushing Thunder.

As for the news of Meng Chong being attacked, the City Lord didn’t feel worried at all.

In order to protect his grandson, he had already given Meng Chong a special talisman. As long as Meng Chong faced a life-and-death crisis, the talisman would burst out with immense power. Even if it didn’t directly kill the enemy, it would protect Meng Chong for enough time that the City Lord could arrive in person.

Moreover, there were many other protective measures in place, including things similar to Space Escape Talismans.

…

Midnight.

Ning Zhuo lay on the bed with his eyes open.

“Why isn’t it taking my soul? I want to enter the immortal palace!”

The young man kicked his legs and gradually grew anxious.

He had a hunch that if he just waited like this, he would only be delaying important matters.

“Can I enter the immortal palace voluntarily?”

Ning Zhuo thought of the imprint that had been planted on him in the maintenance room previously.

He activated the Buddha Heart Demon Seal. After exerting effort for a while, the imprint reading “Trial Disciple” appeared on his chest again.

The next moment, a Life-Hanging Thread pierced through space and touched his soul.

Ning Zhuo’s world went dark, his soul was drawn along the thread, and he entered the palace for the third time!

…

In the main hall of the immortal palace.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, which had been sleeping soundly, suddenly trembled as it sensed that Ning Zhuo had successfully entered the palace.

It spat fire and leaped into the air again, flying around madly in the main hall and smashing into the pillars with its head and body.

All the while, it let out loud roars…

The Lava Immortal Palace became active again.

Countless treasure lights pierced out in all directions. Thick clouds of smoke churned as lava began to boil.

“Huh? Shaking again?!” The Fire Persimmon City Lord’s eyes widened. He immediately took action, mobilizing the full power of the immortal city’s grand formation to suppress the immortal palace as best he could.

“What’s going on?!” Face red under the glow of the lava, the Fire Persimmon City Lord’s expression grew dark, and the doubts in his heart increased.
