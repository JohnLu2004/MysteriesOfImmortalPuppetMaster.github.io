Chapter 55: Zhu Xuanji[^1]

“Subordinate Fei Si seeks an audience with Sir City Lord.” Fei Si stood atop Fire Persimmon Mountain, bowing deeply toward the thick layers of cloud above his head.

The billowing clouds parted like a curtain, revealing the figure of the Fire Persimmon City Lord.

Fei Si slowly flew upward. Once near the City Lord, he bowed again and began reporting on the city affairs.

Almost all of Fire Persimmon Immortal City's business was handled by him. Only significant matters would be reported directly to the City Lord.

The Fire Persimmon City Lord spent most of his time cultivating.

He was the only Nascent Soul in Fire Persimmon Immortal City. As long as his condition remained stable, the entire city would stay in order.

At the moment, the top priority was, of course, Lava Immortal Palace.

The incident with the Technique Transmission Bell had caught the City Lord off guard, but since then, he had taken direct control, overseeing things from the clouds above the mountaintop and stabilizing the situation.

Even when the Lava Immortal Palace erupted repeatedly, he had suppressed it and kept things from escalating.

Fei Si focused his report on arrangements for the Fire Persimmon Festival, which was right around the corner.

“So far, nearly two thousand explosive fire monkeys have been created.

“I’ve negotiated with the Zhou, Zheng, and Ning Clans—most of the Foundation Establishment cultivators entrusted with controlling the explosive fire monkeys will be from these three clans.

“In addition, the Monkey Head Gang’s current leader, Yuan Er[^2], has volunteered to participate no matter the risks.”

“This subordinate was moved by his loyalty and also considered the shortage of labor, so I agreed for the Monkey Head Gang to join the operation.

“In past Fire Persimmon Festivals, the gang’s monkey pets have always played the main role in harvesting fire persimmons, so letting them get involved is another layer of security.

“As for the encirclement and suppression of the black shadow demonic cultivator, this subordinate has also made some arrangements. Everything is in this jade slip.”

The City Lord infused his divine sense into the jade slip and saw clearly organized strategies and meticulous steps. Beyond the main arrangements, there were also many backup plans.

The main force for the suppression would naturally be the Golden Core cultivators of the City Lord Mansion and the Zhou and Zheng Clans. The Ning Clan's old ancestor was still in recovering in seclusion but would make an appearance at the crucial moment as a trump card.

Since the first appearance of the black shadow demonic cultivator, Fei Si had acted on behalf of the City Lord Mansion and proactively contacted the other three clans to coordinate the counteroffensive.

Using this as justification, City Lord Mansion had unified the three clans under one banner.

Fei Si had been observing secretly but found no evidence that any of the clans were colluding with black shadow demonic cultivator.

“Proceed as planned.” After reviewing the information, the Fire Persimmon City Lord approved Fei Si’s plan.

There was no need for the City Lord to join the suppression himself.

The opponent was merely a Golden Core. Fire Persimmon Immortal City was deploying four Golden Core cultivators, which was more than enough power.

From the City Lord Mansion's perspective, having the Fire Persimmon City Lord remain stationed at the mountaintop was the most correct move.

It was obvious that the black shadow demonic cultivator had been desperately trying to sneak into the Lava Immortal Palace. The first time, they had been blocked by Zheng Shuanggou. The second time, they made a move near the dungeon but were discovered by Chi Dun carrying the Warning Heart Bell.

If there really was an accomplice, then the third action—attacking Purple Sun Villa and leaving the medicinal pills behind in Fire Persimmon Forest—was clearly a ploy to lure the Fire Persimmon City Lord away.

The more the enemy wanted something, the more you couldn’t let them succeed!

As long as the City Lord guarded the mountaintop, he would be in an unshakable position.

“Sir, this subordinate has one more urgent matter to report,” Fei Si said. “Since the failure of his last challenge, Young Master Meng Chong has entered another round of secluded special training.

“He’s been using his Ferocious Rushing Thunder immortal talent far too frequently. His consumption is becoming unsustainable.

“This subordinate is deeply worried.

“I’ve tried to persuade Young Master Meng Chong again and again, but he won’t listen and continues acting on his own.”

As he spoke, Fei Si handed over another jade slip.

Inside the jade slip was a recent image of Meng Chong during training.

His once robust physique was completely gone.

His body was now visibly gaunt, his cheekbones protruding and his eyes sunken in. However, his gaze had only grown sharper. It was almost as if he was cultivating some demonic technique, burning his life force in exchange for a brief surge in strength.

The City Lord smiled slightly: “Then just let him continue acting on his own.”

Fei Si was stunned: “Sir City Lord, you…”

The Fire Persimmon City Lord spoke gently: “Innate talent and innate nature are two sides of the same coin. To express your innate nature is to unleash your innate talent.

“The stronger the innate talent, the more forceful the impulses of your innate nature.

“Only by fully expressing your innate nature can you draw out the full potential of your innate talent.

“Let me ask you—how has Chong’er’s progress been in the past couple of months?”

Fei Si replied, “He has improved at an astonishing rate. This subordinate is in awe.”

And it was true.

In the very beginning, Meng Chong couldn’t even dodge the Thousand Jun Heavy Hammer Platform. Later, he dodged the heavy hammer, but failed to escape the metal fishing net. After that, he broke through the net, but couldn’t control his speed and was sliced into pieces by the wires.

After his special training, he completely adapted to his extreme speed. His movements became incredibly swift and agile, and he passed through all obstacles with ease.

The City Lord continued: “From the footage in the jade slip, I can see he’s already at the verge of a breakthrough in this round of special training. Previously, his use of Ferocious Rushing Thunder was flat and monotonous. Now, he’s beginning to adjust his breathing, introducing rhythm.

“He’s gradually understanding the principle that pure forcefulness cannot last, and that there is a rule of yielding to grow stronger.

“Once he breaks through, he’ll gain rhythm, granting him slowness within speed and speed within slowness, allowing him to accelerate even after reaching his top speed.

“At that time, he’ll be able to slacken the tightened bowstring. This is the cyclical transformation of yin and yang, the fullness of all things.”

Fei Si had a moment of clarity: “I understand now.

“Innate nature can nourish innate talent, and progressing your innate talent can also refine your innate nature.

“Young Master Meng Chong used to only charge forward recklessly. Once he breaks through this time, his innate nature will improve, teaching him to balance tension and relaxation.”

The City Lord smiled: “This is the path of cultivation. Extreme yang births yin; extreme yin births yang. As the saying goes, reaching the limit gives rise to change.

“Those with super-grade immortal talents are seeds of immortals. They can’t be measured with conventional thoughts.

“Since he has fully activated his super-grade innate talent, let him explore it to the fullest. As his usage of his innate talent improves, it will naturally refine his innate nature as well.

“Chong’er has his own unique path of cultivation.

“As long as there’s no risk to his life, we don’t need to forcibly interfere.

“All we have to do is supply him with medicinal pills and help him replenish as much nutrients as possible.

“In addition, we must gather personnel and form a team to assist him in future challenges.

“The levels in the Lava Immortal Palace cannot be overcome by one person alone.

“Coexistence and cooperation is the true path—this shows that Three Schools Supreme Sage is indeed a great monk, full of compassion and seeking salvation for all living beings.”

Fei Si quickly said: “When Young Master Meng Chong began recultivating, the mansion had already organized thirty people to recultivate alongside him.

“After Young Master Meng Chong returned from his first foray into the immortal palace, the recultivation team was expanded to fifty members.

“However, most of these people lack innate talents and are still recultivating. There’s a ways to go before they reach the peak of the third level.

“According to this subordinate’s investigation, our mansion’s recultivation team is actually in the best condition. The Zhou Clan ranks second due to the Gathering-Dispersal As-You-Wish Ebbing Spirit Formation. The Zheng Clan is third and the Ning Clan is at the bottom.”

The City Lord nodded and gave a calm compliment: “You’ve done well.”

Fei Si’s face lit up with joy, and he was just about to respond when a voice suddenly rang out: “Meng Kui[^3].

“Since you’ve already grasped the principle of extreme yin birthing yang, why are you still so attached to the Lava Immortal Palace? Are you not concerned about overreaching yourself?”

“Who’s there?” Fei Si shouted in anger and sent his divine sense sweeping out in all directions to search for the intruder.

However, the Fire Persimmon City Lord merely showed a hint of surprise and motioned for Fei Si to stay calm.

The City Lord turned his gaze toward the cloud bank to the right.

There, a figure slowly emerged.

It was a middle-aged man wearing a red brocade robe lined in black embroidery.

His face was square and defined, and golden light shimmered faintly at the center of his pitch-black pupils.

He didn’t conceal his Golden Core aura. Facing both the City Lord and Fei Si, he was calm and composed, and even slightly imposing in presence.

Seeing the familiar brocade robe and the three words “Divine Investigation Bureau” on the middle-aged man’s waist token, Fei Si’s eyelids twitched as he immediately saluted. “Fei Si pays respects to Sir Divine Investigator. May I be so bold as to ask your honored name?”

The middle-aged man smiled slightly: “I am Zhu Xuanji.”

“Surnamed Zhu?” Fei Si’s heart jumped as a thought struck him. Zhu is the royal surname… Could this man in front of me be…

Zhu Xuanji nodded and spoke frankly: “You’ve probably guessed it. Yes, I am not only part of the Divine Investigation Bureau, but also a member of the Southern Bean Immortal Kingdom’s royal family.

“I’ve come to investigate the Lava Immortal Palace!”
