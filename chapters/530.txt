Chapter 503: Fire Crown Divine Cedar

The mechanized army, stepping in unison, suddenly halted.

At the center of the formation, Ning Zhuo looked into the distance: “Is that the Fire Crown Divine Cedar?”

Without any doubt, the Fire Crown Divine Cedar located at the very center of the Ten Li Burning Forest was the heart of this place.

Its robust trunk was as straight as a pillar to the heavens, immovable. The reddish-copper bark was covered with molten lava patterns, as if a thousand fire dragons were winding and roaming beneath it.

Seven hundred and twenty main branches radiated outward like spikes toward the firmament, and each branch split into nine layers of bronze-colored secondary branches, with layer upon layer of flame-like leaves piled up to form a red-gold crown enveloping an area of thirty mu.

And each of its leaves was shaped like a phoenix’s tail, quietly burning with an unextinguishable orange-red flame.

Majestic!

Divine!

This was the strongest impression Ning Zhuo received from his distant observation.

Ning Zhuo did not continue forward but instead stationed his troops on the spot, waiting for the assembly of the Three Generals Battalion.

Ever since he had captured Yan Jin alive, the fire curtain no longer appeared, and the towering blaze in the Burning Forest had mostly subsided, with only the burning timber quietly aflame.

Ning Zhuo, with his keen mind, immediately deduced that his clash with Yan Jin had alleviated a great deal of pressure on the Three Generals Battalion.

The Three Generals Battalion must have immediately advanced and smashed the Great Forest Defense Formation, which resulted in the present state.

The big-headed youth touched his mechanical ring.

The ring was silent, yet Ning Zhuo still decided to wait until the Three Generals Battalion attacked together.

Because the mechanical ring could alert during life-or-death crises, but if his life was not in danger, it might also cause significant losses.

Ning Zhuo, with his cautious nature, would not easily make the mistake of rashness.

“Advisor!”

“Advisor!!”

Not long after, the Three Generals Battalion rapidly marched and arrived at Ning Zhuo’s side.

“Is this… Yan Jin?” the Three Generals quickly discovered Yan Jin lying at Ning Zhuo’s feet.

“Indeed,” Ning Zhuo nodded and smiled.

Zhang Hei scratched his head: “My three brothers, joining forces, merely beheaded that Flowing Flame Fairy. Advisor, how did you manage to capture Yan Jin alive? Impressive!”

The two sides quickly communicated with each other, and upon learning of the situation after their separation, found it to be roughly as they had surmised.

Liu Er’s gaze fell onto Yan Jin, and he said to Ning Zhuo, “Advisor, could you partially remove his seal so that I might persuade him a bit?”

Ning Zhuo: “Of course.”

A talisman was torn off from Yan Jin, and instantly his divine sense could once again spread outward.

Liu Er then began to persuade him, but Yan Jin immediately cut him off with one sentence: “You are merely a prisoner-capturing general, one of the assorted generals; how can you possibly be in command?”

Liu Er’s expression froze.

He added, “Though I cannot take command, I do possess some ability to reduce your penalty.”

“Right now, you have the opportunity to earn merit despite your crimes.”

This time, Yan Jin’s expression froze.

Liu Er promptly said, “I know that having you persuade Luo Chen to surrender is an unrealistic proposition.”

“But what if you persuade him to retreat on his own accord?”

“Our army’s orders were to seize this stretch of the Ten Li Burning Forest, not to engage in a fight to the death with you all.”

Yan Jin displayed a thoughtful expression.

Liu Er continued, “Releasing you is absolutely out of the question. After all, capturing a Golden Core cultivator alive is a war merit!”

“Moreover, Yan Daoyou is a great craftsman of the Ten Li Burning Forest, renowned far and wide, so the war merit achieved because of you would at least be doubled.”

“If you can persuade Luo Chen to withdraw, it would be good for everyone.”

“Firstly, both sides would avoid bloodshed. Secondly, you could have your penalty mitigated.”

“The previous grand battle had already completely proven that the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King was by no means a match for Marshal Du. Furthermore, the Thousand Peak Forest will eventually belong to both nations, and your defection from darkness to light is nothing but a life-changing opportunity, isn’t it?”

Yan Jin glanced at Liu Er, and in his heart he thought, “The intelligence didn’t mention that this human–demon hybrid Golden Core cultivator would be so eloquent!”

Yan Jin was persuaded.

He transmitted his thoughts with his divine sense, “I can only try it out.”

Liu Er immediately broke into a smile and encouraged warmly, “Even if you just try, Yan Daoyou, your action will win favor, and your penalty can be appropriately reduced.”

“Third brother, why are you just standing there? Hurry and help Yan Daoyou up.”

Zhang Hei uttered a couple of “ohs,” as if waking from a dream, and hoisted Yan Jin up by his neck so that he stood.

Yan Jin felt like a kitten or a puppy, and under such humiliation, he couldn’t help but glare fiercely at Zhang Hei.

Zhang Hei immediately glared back.

Yan Jin coughed twice, and communicated via divine sense, “Let me come closer to facilitate the transmission of our divine senses.”

However, Ning Zhuo shook his head: “Coming closer is acceptable, but the transmission of divine sense is not allowed. Who knows what you and Luo Chen might be muttering about?”

“Let me make a small mechanism.”

Liu Er nodded in agreement, then led the Three Generals Battalion, escorting Yan Jin, carefully advancing towards the Fire Crown Divine Cedar.

As they drew nearer, the oppressive presence of the Fire Crown Divine Cedar grew stronger for everyone.

Ning Zhuo also saw the scene beneath the trunk.

The roots of the Fire Crown Divine Cedar coiled like a twisted dragon, forming a bulging high platform.

On the raised platform, at the spot nearest to the trunk, sat a cultivator.

It was Luo Chen!

Luo Chen suddenly opened his eyes wide, and sparks of lightning flashed in them.

While moving, Ning Zhuo crafted a small mechanism, and at this moment, having succeeded, he threw the palm-sized device to Yan Jin.

Yan Jin imbued it with his divine sense, and the mechanism emitted a sound, persuading Luo Chen to withdraw.

Luo Chen snorted coldly, “The Dragon King Temple has entrusted me with a heavy responsibility to guard this place; how could I escape without a battle?”

“Besides, I am at the Nascent Soul level, and the strongest among you are nothing more than Golden Core cultivators. How dare you be so shameless as to ask me to retreat voluntarily? Ridiculous!”

“Let me gauge your strength and see if you are just blowing hot air!”

Having said that, Luo Chen stood up and looked up at the sky: “Fellow Taoists in the heavens, are you going to be mere bystanders? No matter what schemes you may have, why not come and fight as well?”

Hidden within the clouds, Lin Bufan’s heart stirred: “I have the One-Leaf Obscuring Eyes technique to conceal myself; how could I be detected?”

“Is this Luo Chen tricking me?”

Lin Bufan still chose to hold his ground.

Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning were all taken aback, each looking upward toward the sky, their divine senses scanning chaotically, but they discovered nothing.

Sun Lingtong promptly reminded Ning Zhuo, “Ha, I have spotted him. I didn’t expect that Lin Bufan had not left yet, but was hiding in that cloud.”

Upon learning that our side had strong reinforcements, Ning Zhuo’s heart was immediately delighted, yet also filled with some doubts: “How could Lin Bufan return like this? Or perhaps he has been lingering nearby all along? This sect leader, being cautious and profound, may well have ulterior motives?”

In any case, given the relationship between the Ning family and the Myriad Medicine Sect, Lin Bufan’s appearance now served as an insurance, lending Ning Zhuo more confidence in the upcoming battle.

Ning Zhuo thought about it, but did not reveal this secret to the Three Generals.

Although the three generals-Liu, Guan, and Zhang-had some suspicions, none of them showed it on their faces.

Liu Er’s thoughts turned: “Luo, dear friend of the Way, with your fine stratagem, deliberately concocting others -are you trying to make it so that we cannot fight with all our hearts?”

Luo Chen sighed.

He especially hoped that Lin Bufan would step forward and fight against him.

In that case, his reputation would be much improved.

But having been repelled by the Three Generals Battalion, Liu, Guan, and Zhang were ultimately only at the Golden Core stage, while Ning Zhuo was even only at the Foundation Establishment stage.

Yan Jin’s persuasion attempt appeared ineffective, yet it had already yielded tremendous results.

Luo Chen had already decided to withdraw, but this withdrawal had to be done with dignity, so that he could later account for it.

“If I can capture the Wood-in-Fire, then I can retreat immediately. There’s no need to start fidgeting now. Sigh…”

Luo Chen secretly sighed, but his face remained resolute.

He declared loudly, “Three Generals Battalion, watch this!”

In the next moment, his sleeves fluttered, and with swift finger formations and incantations, he unleashed four fire dragons, stirring up boundless waves of heat.

The scorching fire dragons flew in mid-air, then together howled as they swooped down.

“Coming,” Liu Er softly uttered, and then promptly raised the Xuanhuang Sword, holding it horizontally in front of him.

Military strategy: Defending the homeland and strengthening one’s foundation.

Military power was expended by twenty percent; a yellow light enveloped the entire army, enhancing their defenses.

Guan Hong raised the Blood Dragon Blade, continuously slashing in four directions.

Military strength was abruptly expended by forty percent.

Blade technique -Four Calamities Blood-Slaughter Slash!

In an instant, the bloody slaughter energy soared, condensing into four blade shadows that struck the four fire dragons.

Of these, two were directly dispersed, while the other two evaded the blade shadows; though their bodies shrank considerably from injuries, their speed did not diminish but instead increased, and they continued their assault, meeting Zhang Hei’s Serpent Spear.

Military strength was further expended by twenty percent, and under the added enhancement, the Black Serpent Spear’s power surged, crushing the remaining two fire dragons.

The three generals acted in succession, and altogether, eighty percent of their military strength was consumed, successfully countering the fire dragon spell that Luo Chen had long been brewing.

Luo Chen had already initiated the next wave of his attack.

He flipped his sleeve and produced a magical artifact.

The artifact was like a disc, within which lay a large number of copper coins.

The copper coins whirled in mid-air, coalescing into a formation.

In a moment, blue electric light intertwined to form a majestic stag, dashing toward the Three Generals Battalion.

The stag thundered forward, and with each kick, emitted a roar like thunder.

Even from a short distance away, the hairs on the soldiers’ bodies in the Three Generals Battalion stood on end, as though thousands of fine needles in the air were continuously pricking them.

Formation artifact -Thunderclap Stag-Chasing Disc!

The three generals, remaining unruffled in the face of danger, acted one after another, and finally Liu Er raised the Xuanhuang Sword and fiercely slashed, shattering the Thunder Stag.

Luo Chen silently nodded, acknowledging the combat capability of the Three Generals Battalion, thinking, “They are indeed a force capable of capturing Ma Feitui alive.”

At present, with the three generals joining forces, they could indeed rival a Nascent Soul cultivator, but it depended on the specifics.

If it were a Nascent Soul True Lord with mastery over divine abilities, they would most likely be defeated. The battle prior to the grand war -when the Three Generals Battalion was ordered to invade the Thousand Peak Forest and clashed with Tu Ming -was a case in point.

Luo Chen had already intended to retreat; upon seeing that the Three Generals Battalion had exceptional combat strength, he felt not worry but rather delight.

“After one more skirmish, I shall withdraw,” he thought silently.

Not having obtained the Wood-in-Fire, there was no other alternative.

Under the circumstances, Luo Chen could not possibly defend this place to the death.

He turned, his back toward the Three Generals Battalion, took a few steps forward, stood before the Fire Crown Divine Cedar, and extended his hand to give it a gentle pat.

At the same time, he murmured, “Divine Cedar, Divine Cedar, grant me the Fire Crown to assist in this battle.”

The Fire Crown Divine Cedar trembled slightly, and firelight fell from its branches and leaves onto Luo Chen’s head, coalescing into a crown of flames.

The flame crown was limited to Luo Chen’s hair, burning quietly, while his entire skin was enveloped in a layer of fiery red radiance.

His entire aura suddenly soared, reaching a peak state.

“Fire Crown!”

The three generals displayed expressions of gravity, but were not astonished.

It was common knowledge that the Fire Crown Divine Cedar could bestow a Fire Crown; it was not a secret matter.

Many cultivators who ventured to the Ten Li Burning Forest to refine artifacts, in order to improve their chances of success and to ensure that their state remained optimal throughout the refining process, would come to the Fire Crown Divine Cedar to offer prayers, requesting a Fire Crown.

This Fire Crown was capable of drastically depleting a cultivator’s spiritual power, energy, and divine sense, ensuring that the cultivator’s state remained at its peak during the entire refining process.

Its disadvantages, apart from the burning sensation, were that it consumed energy so intensely that it verged on destruction.

In an extremely brutal manner, it rapidly consumed the cultivator’s inner strength, unleashing a dazzling brilliance akin to flames.

Any cultivator who donned the Fire Crown for a prolonged time would subsequently need a long period of recuperation.

Generally speaking, for a cultivator to obtain a Fire Crown, they had to offer sacrifices and perform a series of prayer rituals, only then would there be a possibility of being bestowed with the Fire Crown.

As the leader of the forest, Luo Chen naturally possessed different privileges and treatment.

He merely needed to softly call out a few times to obtain a Fire Crown.

Upon wearing the Fire Crown, Luo Chen’s heart was filled with an intense sense of urgency.

He advanced and once again clashed with the Three Generals Battalion.

This time, the three generals alone could hardly hold their own.

Ning Zhuo also promptly made his move.

Pooling the power of the four, they repelled Luo Chen’s attack.

Unable to press his attack, Luo Chen immediately ceased his assault, saying, “The offensive of the Three Generals Battalion is so formidable; indeed, impressive.”

“I, Luo, will keep this grudge in mind.”

“Someday, I shall surely return to this place by force and reclaim what was lost.”

After saying these parting words, Luo Chen voluntarily extinguished the Fire Crown upon his head, withdrew, and flew into the air.

In the next moment, a sudden anomaly occurred!

“Forest Chief Luo, wait a moment before retreating; with me here, defeating this army will be a trivial matter!”

A hoarse voice resounded across the battlefield.

“Who is it?!” Luo Chen exclaimed in surprise.

He immediately turned his gaze to the sky.

In the clouds, Lin Bufan was likewise startled.

As he surveyed the battlefield, it was only at this moment that he discovered that a Nascent Soul-level existence was still concealed.

Gao Cuo, who had been hiding in the dark, was also shocked.

Old Sword was also taken aback, and then suddenly realized, “So the Fire Crown Divine Cedar has become a deity!”

In the next moment, the Fire Crown Divine Cedar swayed its body and condensed into a flaming dharma body that floated in mid-air, obstructing Luo Chen’s path.

The flaming dharma body was anything but ordinary. After Luo Chen discerned it, he exclaimed in amazement, “So, the Wood-in-Fire has indeed been taken by you!”

The Fire Crown Divine Deity nodded, “I was enlightened by the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King, arranged by his will, and secretly ascended to a deity. This Wood-in-Fire was originally bestowed upon me by the Ginseng Whiskered Dragon King.”
“Luo Chen, you must not shrink back in battle. With you and me joining forces, we will undoubtedly wipe out the entire Three Generals Battalion!”

Luo Chen, in astonishment, said, “This…”

The Fire Crown Divine Deity coldly sneered, “Just behold my Dao Field!”

Fire Crown Dao Field!

In the next moment, the Dao Field instantly unfolded, and the Burning Forest around the Three Generals Battalion completely disappeared, leaving behind only a piece of barren ground engulfed in flames.

Liu, Guan, Zhang, and the rest, including all of Ning Zhuo’s soldiers, found that a flame crown was burning above their heads.

In an instant, the entire army’s condition soared to its peak state.

Luo Chen, looking at the Fire Crown reigniting above his head, said, “Fire Crown Divine, first remove the crown from my head.”

But the Fire Crown Divine Deity coldly sneered, “You and I shall attack with all our strength, and we must annihilate them in the shortest possible time! If we win this battle, only then will I remove the Fire Crown from your head; otherwise, you shall await being burned to death!”
