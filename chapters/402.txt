Chapter 402: This is Completely Absurd!

For a moment, all the spectators were shocked and uncertain.

Ning Zhuo had comprehended techniques during battle, learning the Three Thousand Water Strikes technique from Linghu Jiu.

However, his Three Thousand Water Strikes were unconventional, appearing like dragons and pythons, continuously weaving through and combining attacks to form three massive strikes.

Shen Lingshu, unaware of the truth, lost his composure. His eyes widened in shock: "I've finally witnessed the legendary supreme comprehension ability with my own eyes. Is this what a child of destiny is like? Truly extraordinary!"

Zhu Xuan Ji also said: "Is Ning Zhuo's comprehension ability really this powerful? No wonder he's made such progress in wood element techniques! He truly deserves to be chosen by the Three Sect Masters."

However, Ning Jiu Fan, Lin Bu Fan, Lin Shan Shan, and others knew the truth.

This was because Ning Zhuo had received guidance from the Five Elements Divine Master again under the Spirit Concealment Willow, elevating his realm. He had informed those around him about this.

Not only Sun Ling Tong and Ning Jiu Fan knew, but even Linghu Jiu wasn't kept in the dark.

Since Linghu Jiu knew, naturally Lin Bu Fan and Lin Shan Shan were also aware.

Lin Bu Fan stopped stroking his beard, his eyes flashing with brilliance: "Just what level has this brat Ning Zhuo's Five Elements realm been elevated to?"

"To achieve this level, learning something after seeing it just once... he must be at least at the Master level."

Upon reaching the Master realm, one grasps the fundamental principles. Any cultivator at the Master level can create various techniques and skills following these fundamental principles.

Master, indeed - one who can establish their own school of thought.

Ning Zhuo's current battle comprehension was essentially because he had already mastered the fundamental principles of the water element. Upon seeing Linghu Jiu use the Three Thousand Water Strikes technique, it was like seeing one application of the water element.

He then followed these principles, imitating this application method. It was like building from a high vantage point, working downward, naturally resulting in a high success rate of imitation.

Ning Jiu Fan's mouth opened in a silent laugh.

Ning Zhuo's amazing performance brought honor to him as the Ning family's ancestor.

"Ning Zhuo... is indeed reliable!"

"A Master-level Five Elements realm... even I envy that. After cultivating for so long, I haven't reached that level, yet this brat Ning Zhuo achieved it in just a few days through a fortunate encounter."

"This is simply unbelievable!"

Lin Shan Shan also understood: "I get it now."

"Big Head Ning's Five Elements realm is so profound that he can comprehend any Five Elements technique he sees."

"He has mastered the principles from the inside out, so he only needs to observe and try a few times to imitate any application."

"Given some time to practice and make mistakes, he can imitate Senior Brother's wood and water techniques quite well."

"Doesn't this mean he can instantly understand any Five Elements enlightenment diagram?"

"Can he learn all the Five Elements techniques in the world instantly?"

"Heavens, how old is Ning Zhuo anyway?"

Despite Lin Shan Shan's usual grace, she now felt intense envy turning into jealousy.

She couldn't help feeling angry, feeling like she had wasted too much time. But then she realized that even if she had practiced diligently, she couldn't reach Ning Zhuo's level.

After all, guidance from the Five Elements Divine Master and the Spirit Concealment Willow were extraordinary opportunities that ordinary people could never replicate!

Realizing this, Lin Shan Shan became even more angry: "Why haven't I encountered such good fortune?"

Linghu Jiu was the first to accept this reality.

Both shocked and delighted, he praised: "Brother Ning Zhuo, what an excellent realm!"

Ning Zhuo hurriedly replied: "Brother, you praise me too much. I merely received help from ancient masters, it wasn't my own achievement. I can hardly speak of it."

But at that moment, the Five Elements Divine Master's laughter rang out: "Haha, what's there to be modest about? Kid, you're just too humble."

"You should know that even if I guide others, they couldn't possibly elevate their Five Elements realm to such a degree."

"Your comprehension ability is rare, and you have celestial talent to assist you. Given time, you'll surely sweep through the world, or at least dominate a region!"

Hearing the Five Elements Divine Master's evaluation, everyone had different expressions.

Ning Zhuo's heart skipped a beat: "Celestial talent? My second talent, no, my original talent, is it supreme?"

Zhu Xuan Ji and Shen Lingshu weren't surprised, both thinking that as the destined child, such achievements were natural. How else could he face the great Buddhist-Demonic dispute in the future?

Ning Jiu Fan was repeatedly delighted: "Ning Zhuo's future is promising, our Ning family has produced a dragon! Future prosperity is within reach!"

Lin Shan Shan and Lin Bu Fan's expressions were much more complex.

Lin Bu Fan fell into deep thought. Ning Zhuo's future achievements would be so great, possessing celestial talent, only sixteen years old, and his Five Elements realm had reached at least the Master level in water. With such guidance from the Five Elements Divine Master, given time, his achievements would surely surpass his own!

How should one face such a person, since he isn't an enemy?

"My senior disciple Linghu Jiu only has superior talent, and with his casual and straightforward nature, even if he inherits my Myriad Medicine Sect in the future, he'll probably just maintain it."

"In comparison, this brat Ning Zhuo, bearing ambition, skilled in tactics, eloquent in speech, and decisive and ruthless in action."

"Though kidnapping Shan Shan angered me greatly, setting aside personal feelings and thinking back, his actions were quick, precise, and underhanded. If it were me, I would have done the same."

"If... if I were to marry Shan Shan to him, what would happen?"

Suddenly, a bold idea emerged in Lin Bu Fan's mind.

Thinking of this, he couldn't help but shift his gaze to Lin Shan Shan.

Lin Shan Shan's expression was also complex, showing both joy and resentment.

Her thoughts fluctuated, her eyes bright: "This big-headed fool, I knew he was extraordinary from our first meeting. My judgment was indeed correct!"

Seeing his beloved daughter staring intently at Ning Zhuo, Lin Bu Fan felt mixed emotions and firmly rejected his previous thought: "No, with Shan Shan's personality and tactics, if she married Ning Zhuo, she might be consumed completely."

"Ning Zhuo is thick-skinned and black-hearted, definitely not a good match for Shan Shan."

"Instead, Jiu'er is straightforward and generous, deeply in love with Shan Shan, and will surely treat her well in the future."

Lin Bu Fan had married and had children, and accepted disciples, all for the sake of his power and cultivation.

But as he said earlier in the reception hall - people change.

After spending time together and investing energy in Lin Shan Shan, Linghu Jiu, and others, his thoughts as a father and master gradually changed him.

He hoped more for Lin Shan Shan's future to be stable.

Water Element - Water Barrier Surrounding.

Ning Zhuo laughed heartily, having successfully imitated and mastered another technique.

Jade-like water flows surrounded him as he stood on the water's surface, using Three Thousand Water Strikes, forcing Linghu Jiu to repeatedly retreat.

The battlefield environment that Linghu Jiu had extensively modified also became something Ning Zhuo could utilize.

Regarding terrain advantage, both benefited equally.

Linghu Jiu took a deep breath and immediately developed a new tactic.

He laughed loudly: "Brother, can you still imitate the following techniques?"

Wind Element Technique - Wind Wave Surge!

Fierce winds swept through, forming shocking wind waves that collided with Three Thousand Water Strikes, destroying the water element.

Wind Element Technique - Wind Blade Storm!

Linghu Jiu charged forward again, and wherever he passed, the winds were extremely sharp, causing the surging water flows to continuously weaken and collapse.

Ning Zhuo gritted his teeth, unable to see through these techniques.

Wind, Thunder, Ice, Magnetic, and other elements, though closely related to the Five Elements, strictly speaking, were not among them.

Wind Element Technique - One Generation of Wind Flow.
Eight Directions Sword Technique - Upper Direction Sword.

Linghu Jiu held his sword, moving gracefully, his sword light flowing like water and wind, actually able to combine techniques with swordplay, displaying attacks far superior to before -
Upper Wind Sword!

Even with the Demon-Tainted Blood Tendon Technique and Water Barrier Protection, Ning Zhuo didn't dare face its sharp edge, continuously retreating.

Linghu Jiu pursued aggressively, the wild wind following his voice, growing stronger.

Ning Zhuo secretly cursed his misfortune, clearly understanding his previous tactical error. Against Linghu Jiu's offensive momentum, one success led to a hundred, becoming stronger with the upper hand.

The best strategy would have been to suppress and crush it while it was just beginning, before it gained momentum.

At this moment, with just Ning Zhuo's technique methods, it was truly difficult to stop, unless...

In the next moment, Ning Zhuo decisively released his mechanical creation.

Thirty floating mechanical devices appeared, equipped with arms and legs.

Ning Zhuo's fingers slightly spread, moving frequently, pulling and pushing, alternately extending and contracting.

The thirty mechanical creations divided into three waves, charging toward Linghu Jiu in succession.

The upwind sword struck the mechanical creatures, causing damage, but not severe. Ning Zhuo had used quite solid materials in their construction, all using foundation-level materials.

Frost source.

Old cold legs.

Suffering body!

Especially the latter, which made the damaged mechanisms even more formidable.

Linghu Jiu was forced to switch from offense to defense, his sword creating brilliant lights, firmly guarding all directions.

Around him, the thirty mechanical fists and feet attacked in turns, coordinating perfectly, forming continuous waves of attacks that left Linghu Jiu struggling to defend.

Seeing the battle situation reversed again, the spectators' expressions changed slightly.

Many wondered to themselves, how did they compare to Ning Zhuo and Linghu Jiu at the Foundation Establishment level? They couldn't match these endless techniques! Ning Zhuo launched his offensive, decisively escalating.

He controlled the mechanical creatures while casting spells.

"Earth veins hidden, mysterious roots deep, vines entangling, all things bound. Rise!"

Roots appeared from nowhere, entangling Linghu Jiu, creating openings even if only for moments, enough for the mechanisms to launch punches and kicks.

"Pine winds howling, mighty waves surging, forest seas rolling, overturning the earth. Sweep!"

Green light like tides sent Linghu Jiu tumbling. The mechanical attacks followed like shadows, continuously striking.

"Ancient woods creaking, tree realm vast, heaven and earth changing color, spirit roots descending. Descend!"

Ancient forests appeared again, countless branches and roots working with the mechanical attacks, pressing Linghu Jiu into a corner.

Linghu Jiu's injuries grew worse, his face bruised, and with many frost effects on his body, his combat ability seriously declining, approaching defeat.

Lin Bufan and Lin Shanshan's expressions changed slightly.

With such combat power, Ning Zhuo could definitely establish himself on Small Contest Peak. Even the highest-ranked Lai Wuying and Zheng Xingshi would struggle against such attacks.

Ning Jiufan stroked his beard with a smile.

Linghu Jiu let out a light whistle, finally revealing his trump card at the crucial moment!

He wielded his sword, gathering gentle light. The sword intent dispersed into ethereal manifestations, neither here nor there, like floating life in a dream, real yet unreal.

The Desolate Sword Classic - Moon River Dream.

Life is like a dream, one goblet still awakens the river moon... Ning Zhuo saw a vision where Linghu Jiu sat in a lonely boat, raising his cup to toast the moon's reflection.

When Ning Zhuo came to his senses, he had already fallen for it!

Half of the thirty mechanical creatures fell apart, countless foundations exhausted, unable to function.

Linghu Jiu broke free of the encirclement with one move.

He charged toward Ning Zhuo, his sword thrusting directly!

At this moment, the battlefield was deep in the red ancient woods, with Ning Zhuo concealed in the canopy.

Seeing Linghu Jiu's killing thrust, Ning Zhuo wouldn't just wait there.

He used wood element magic "Fragrant Flower Misleading Tracks" to instantly teleport away.

But Linghu Jiu had planned for this, his posture unchanged, smoothly executing his second move.

Desolate Sword Classic - Snow River Lonely Boat!

He became one with his sword, like a boat sailing through snowy seas, each move flowing. Like a pearl boat on the river, fearless of waves!

Lonely fishing in the cold river, heart like a solitary boat...

Lonely yet determined.

Another vision appeared before Ning Zhuo, seeing snowflakes falling, Linghu Jiu fishing alone from a boat on the river, occasionally drinking cold wine from his gourd.

When he looked closely, he saw a sharp sword light enlarging before his eyes.

Linghu Jiu's sword move ignored the teleportation, directly locking onto Ning Zhuo!

In an instant, Ning Zhuo's pupils contracted, his heart's warning bells ringing wildly, sensing intense threat.

"Dasheng protect me!"

He patted his belt, releasing a Golden Core level mechanical monkey.

Heavy Armored Blood Ape: Dasheng!

Shu Dasheng's body was massive like a city gate, directly blocking Linghu Jiu's path.

Linghu Jiu's sword strike left a shallow mark on Shu Dasheng's body. Shu Dasheng shouted, his arms shaking, bravely charging at Linghu Jiu, trying to grab him.

Wood Element - Hollow Bamboo Shadow.

Linghu Jiu's shadow was caught, but his true body circled around Dasheng, continuing toward Ning Zhuo.

Lonely Sword Scripture - Horizon's Lonely Snow!

Linghu Jiu struck with his sword, the sword light dispersing into white snow, boundless and desolate, lonely and bone-chilling.

Desolation and cold, even soul-crushing despair filled Ning Zhuo's heart.

Ning Zhuo snorted coldly, and backed into a corner, he fiercely brought out the Snake Scythe!

This was the Night Rain Demon Weapon!

Zhu Xuanji's expression changed dramatically.

This mechanical scythe had left a deep impression on him.

"Bad! It's the Horizon's Lonely Snow!" Lin Shanshan suddenly leaped down, intervening in the battle.

"Senior Brother's move isn't fully mastered, he can't control it perfectly, yet its power is extraordinary and could endanger Ning Zhuo's life!"

With intense worry, Lin Shanshan acted without thinking, falling between Ning Zhuo and Linghu Jiu, trying to stop them with all her might.

"Junior Sister!" Linghu Jiu was shocked, hurriedly changing his move.

"This?!" Seeing Lin Shanshan with her back to him, completely unguarded, Ning Zhuo was already swinging the Snake Scythe with full force, only able to forcefully change its direction.

Whoosh!

A purple scythe-shaped blade light shot out, flying into empty space, leaving a purple blade mark that wouldn't fade.

Linghu Jiu's sword light circled around Lin Shanshan, stopping at Ning Zhuo's throat, condensing into a sharp sword.

The three froze in place.

Ning Zhuo stared at the sword tip below his chin, his voice dry: "I've lost."

But Linghu Jiu looked at the still-lingering purple blade mark, his eyes showing shock, slowly withdrawing his sword: "No, I lost."

The Five Elements Divine Lord appeared voluntarily, staring intently at the purple blade mark, moved to say: "What technique is this?"

As a Fashen with Nascent Soul level combat power, the purple blade mark was like tiny raindrops to him, hardly worth mentioning. What moved him was the essence contained within the purple blade mark!

Lin Bufan's expression also froze, for in the instant Ning Zhuo swung with full force, he sensed power that could threaten himself.

Merely at early Foundation Establishment, yet able to threaten someone at the Nascent Soul level?

This was completely unprecedented!
