Chapter 622: The Final Battle Approaches

Within the colossal well, the Yin Tide surged like a raging river, its waves crashing against the well walls with thunderous booms.

The towering White Paper City Lord locked eyes with Ning Zhuo.

Her Paper Doll Clone was about to speak when the City Lord's True Form preemptively commanded, "Don't stop."

Yang Sanyan and Wen Ruanyu exchanged bewildered glances.

The order was clearly directed at Ning Zhuo.

Just because you tell me to keep going, I should?

Ning Zhuo promptly ceased his actions, stepped back, and clasped his hands in a respectful bow. "This junior, Ning Zhuo, son of Meng Yaoyin, pays his respects to the White Paper City Lord!"

The City Lord's gaze remained fixed on Ning Zhuo, but a flicker of intrigue crossed her expression.

Ning Zhuo's response was intriguing.

If one were to praise his courtesy, he had directly defied the City Lord's command to continue.

Yet if one were to accuse him of disrespect, he had performed a flawless bow, leaving no room for reproach.

The Paper Doll Clone flew to its True Form's side. "True Form, much has transpired during your unconsciousness."

The City Lord finally shifted her gaze and nodded slightly at her clone.

In the next instant, she lowered her defenses, allowing the clone to approach.

The clone grasped the True Form's hand, and within a dozen breaths, they exchanged information through their divine sense.

The City Lord's True Form revealed a sudden realization as she gazed at Ning Zhuo. "Meng Yaoyin... I never imagined you were the son of an old friend."

"Now that I look closely, you do share a resemblance with your mother in your eyes and brows."

"Your temperament is similar too. Both of you are remarkably opinionated, even to the point of stubbornness."

"Back then, I urged your mother not to sacrifice her lifespan to save others. She completely disregarded my advice and insisted on acting."

Ning Zhuo's ears twitched slightly. "I never expected to find traces of my mother's life in the White Paper Immortal City."

"I understand my mother well."

"She was kind-hearted and compassionate, and she would have willingly dedicated herself to White Paper Immortal City."

Ning Zhuo's tone shifted. "However, she passed away when I was only two years old."

"So, my views and hers might differ."

"I can continue supplying you with Yang Qi, City Lord. What can you offer in exchange?"

The White Paper City Lord was a Nascent Soul cultivator, while Ning Zhuo was merely at the Foundation Establishment stage.

Yet the young man possessed such audacity that he could converse calmly with a Nascent Soul expert, even directly negotiate and bargain.

After all, he had slain Nascent Soul cultivators during the great war in Two Note Kingdom.

The City Lord's True Form fell silent, while her clone spoke, "Little Friend Ning Zhuo, you are already the Vice City Lord of this city. Second only to the City Lord herself, above all others..."

Ning Zhuo waved his hand dismissively. "It's merely a nominal position. I plan to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect in the future and won't remain here long. Therefore, the Vice City Lord title holds little appeal for me."

Wen Ruanyu opened his mouth to speak, but his lips moved silently, and he remained silent.

The City Lord's True Form chuckled softly. "You're not one to speak idly. Since you propose an exchange, you must desire something specific. Why not state your request directly? Let's see if I can grant it."

"It's simple," Ning Zhuo said calmly. "I want the Paper Giant at the city's south gate."

The City Lord's True Form fell silent again.

The clone spoke with a troubled expression. "This Paper Giant was indeed created because of Meng Yaoyin. However, it's a Nascent Soul-level trump card. From its initial construction to its current maintenance, White Paper Immortal City has invested immense resources. With the Immortal City now besieged on all sides, we desperately need such defenses. We cannot rashly sell it."

Ning Zhuo replied, "If the City Lord grants my request, I assure you I won't take the Paper Giant before this crisis is resolved."

"We must wait until the Immortal City has weathered the Ghost Tide and repelled the Underworld army's assault, until the situation stabilizes, before taking the Paper Giant," Ning Zhuo insisted.

The Paper Doll Clone hesitated. "Actually, the initial idea for the Paper Giant came from Wen Ruanyu. He was one of the founders, and we must consider his feelings in this matter."

Ning Zhuo turned to Wen Ruanyu.

Wen Ruanyu smiled without hesitation, meeting Ning Zhuo's gaze. "I only just learned that Ning Zhuo is Senior Sister's biological son. Though this hasn't been formally confirmed to me, deep down, I prefer to believe this romantic notion."

"I have no objection to entrusting the Paper Giant to Ning Zhuo!" Wen Ruanyu's answer was direct and unequivocal.

Ning Zhuo immediately returned a grateful smile.

Yang Sanyan nodded slightly at Wen Ruanyu, clearly pleased with his stance.

Wen Ruanyu's position was complex. On one hand, he was a Golden Core True Inheritor of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, managing the sect's local outpost. On the other hand, he was a high-ranking official in White Paper Immortal City, having devoted years to its administration and development.

Wen Ruanyu's agreement to Ning Zhuo's request was a clear declaration of his allegiance. It was evident that his loyalty lay with the Myriad Manifestations Sect rather than White Paper Immortal City.

Seeing his stance, the White Paper City Lord finally spoke: "Very well."

The White Paper City Lord was equally decisive, immediately agreeing to Ning Zhuo's request: "After the battle, the Paper Giant will be yours."

"Moreover..."

The City Lord proactively offered the four Soul Cultivator treasures she had previously gifted to Ning Zhuo as additional rewards.

Her reasoning was simple: Ning Zhuo had exposed Zheng Shoumo, the grand internal traitor, and deserved substantial recognition.

Each of these four Soul Cultivator treasures was of the Nascent Soul level!

The White Paper City Lord's True Form and Clones shared a consistent style - both were remarkably generous and magnanimous.

"Hahaha! This City Lord is truly astute and knows how to seize opportunities. Excellent, Little Zhuo!" Sun Lingtong, who had been observing everything from afar using his Life Thred Connection, was delighted and secretly congratulated Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo, however, remained calm, analyzing the situation inwardly: "As expected of the White Paper City Lord - her political acumen is formidable!"

"She's already laying the groundwork for the future ecosystem of the Immortal City."

The current situation had Ning Zhuo, the savior, leaning toward the Myriad Manifestations Sect.

The White Paper Immortal City desperately needed the sect's renewed assistance to weather this crisis.

Before Ning Zhuo officially joined the Myriad Manifestations Sect, the City Lord was already heavily courting him with lavish rewards.

She likely planned for Ning Zhuo to serve as a bridge between the White Paper Immortal City and the Myriad Manifestations Sect as Vice City Lord in the future.

In other words, the White Paper City Lord was not only trying to win over Ning Zhuo, but also positioning him as a future mediator in the power struggles between the White Paper Immortal City and the Myriad Manifestations Sect.

"Enough of that. The future will take care of itself. What matters most is resolving the present," Ning Zhuo thought, recognizing the City Lord's strategic foresight. While wary, he couldn't help but admire her ambition.

After all, she was genuinely magnanimous and truly investing heavily in securing his allegiance.

Ning Zhuo first thanked the City Lord for her generous reward, then steered the conversation back on track. "Now that you've awakened, City Lord, let's finalize the Divine Contract before discussing further matters."

Yang Sanyan observed Ning Zhuo, impressed by his steady temperament and meticulous approach.

The City Lord's True Form nodded slightly. "Agreed."

Yang Sanyan produced a Divine Edict.

The scroll unfurled, revealing the image of the Celestial God Contract on its reverse side.

The deity's face was as flawless as jade, with a third eye open on his forehead. In one hand, he held the Mirror of Past Causes, and in the other, the Golden Edict of Future Consequences. He wore a moon-white celestial silk robe embroidered with cloud patterns, a dark jade dragon pendant at his waist, and mountain-and-river boots. Beneath him rode a three-legged Azure Harmony Crane.

The crane's feathers shimmered with hidden truths of the Great Dao, and each flap of its wings scattered golden contract glyphs.

On the scroll's front lay the full text of the Divine Contract.

Ning Zhuo and the others carefully studied the contents of the Celestial God Contract, each offering their opinions.

Yang Sanyan immediately revised the document, and after confirming it was error-free, he promptly activated the Divine Edict.

Harnessing the power of the Celestial God Contract, they swore that none of them had any close ties to Zheng Shoumo or the mysterious organization. Violation of this oath would result in the Celestial God Contract's retribution, leading to their death and the dissolution of their cultivation.

With the Divine Contract established, everyone present remained unharmed.

Yang Sanyan and the others breathed a collective sigh of relief, and the tension in the air dissipated significantly.

The City Lord Clone spoke, "Little Friend Ning Zhuo, would you please demonstrate your Dual Cultivation techniques once more?"

Ning Zhuo coughed awkwardly, quickly correcting her. "It was merely a minor exchange of yin and yang energies. I wouldn't consider it true Dual Cultivation."

"However, before we proceed, I have a small request."

"Please, speak freely," the City Lord Clone replied.

"Earlier, you kindly bestowed three talisman papers upon me. I must ask you to take them back."

These three talisman papers had burrowed directly into Ning Zhuo's three dantian, where he had suppressed them using three different cultivation techniques.

Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong had already planned to use the Theft Path Methods to retrieve these talismans. After all, human hearts were unpredictable, and these were three hidden thunderbolts.

However, neither of them was certain whether their Theft Path Methods would succeed.

Having the City Lord Clone personally retrieve them would be the best outcome.

The City Lord Clone hesitated. "Is this wise? I'll imbue you with three talisman papers, each capable of saving you once. You're currently impersonating Jiao Ma, and the taller the tree, the stronger the wind. What if Zheng Shoumo isn't the only internal traitor targeting you?"

Ning Zhuo instinctively touched his Mechanism Ring and bluntly told the City Lord Clone to take the talismans. He had his own means of self-protection.

Seeing Ning Zhuo's firm stance, the City Lord Clone didn't press the matter. She summoned the three talisman papers with a wave of her hand and retrieved them.

Only then did Ning Zhuo resume his efforts, releasing Yang Qi to supply the White Paper City Lord.

The White Paper City Lord's True Form slowly closed her eyes, falling into a moment of contemplative silence as if savoring the energy.

After a while, she opened her eyes again, her gaze questioning: "Why did you stop?"

Ning Zhuo forced a bitter smile, his voice weak and apologetic. "Senior, your power is as vast as the sea and as solid as a mountain. I'm merely a humble Foundation Establishment cultivator. Reaching this point has already pushed me to my limit. Continuing further might cost me my lifespan."

"I'll need some time to recuperate before I can gather such Yang Qi again."

Of course, this wasn't entirely true.

The Yin-Yang One Qi Kettle still held thirty percent of its Yang Qi reserves. Ning Zhuo had only used seventy percent.

The White Paper City Lord quietly observed Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo met the City Lord's gaze without fear, his expression open and honest.

The City Lord's True Form spoke coldly, "I am unfamiliar with this medical technique. Little Friend Ning Zhuo, would you be willing to sell it?"

Ning Zhuo immediately shook his head in refusal.

Noticing the tense atmosphere, Wen Ruanyu quickly congratulated the City Lord, attempting to ease the tension.

The City Lord's True Form nodded slightly. "In that case, I can finally leave the Deep Well temporarily. At least I'll have the strength to fight in times of crisis."

"But only temporarily."

"The truth is clear to all of you. Without my personal suppression, the White Paper Immortal City's foundations will inevitably crumble under this overwhelming Yin Qi. The city will fall, and its people will perish!"

Wen Ruanyu hastily praised the City Lord's noble character, secretly acknowledging the immense sacrifices she had made for the sake of countless citizens.

"For specific defense arrangements, simply consult my clone," the City Lord's True Form said, dismissing them.

Yang Sanyan had no choice but to take his leave.

After the Formation space closed, they retreated to a small reception hall. There, they summoned Tie Guzheng and secretly discussed matters for half an hour, reaching preliminary consensus on many points.

That evening, Ning Zhuo hosted a dinner for Yang Sanyan and Wen Ruanyu.

During the meal, Ning Zhuo showed Wen Ruanyu some items left behind by his mother.

This tangible proof finally convinced Wen Ruanyu of Ning Zhuo's identity. His eyes reddened at the table, and tears began to fall.

He immediately pledged to Ning Zhuo, "Little Zhuo, if you ever face any difficulties in the future, come to me without hesitation! I will do everything in my power to assist you!"

Yang Sanyan turned to Wen Ruanyu and said, "Little Friend Ning Zhuo possesses extraordinary talent and remarkable skills. This year's Flying Cloud Assembly presents a golden opportunity for him to soar to new heights."

"In the future, you might face difficulties that require his intervention to resolve."

Though Yang Sanyan had only just met Ning Zhuo, their brief shared experience had completely changed his perception of the young man.

Wen Ruanyu nodded in agreement with Yang Sanyan's words.

Ning Zhuo waved his hand, offering modest self-deprecation while maintaining an air of confident composure.

The next day, Qing Chi came to find Ning Zhuo early in the morning.

"I heard you entered the City Lord's Mansion yesterday and were received by the City Lord's True Form. You even hosted a banquet for that guy Yang Sanyan last night. Did he give you any trouble?"

Qing Chi, who had been captured by Yang Sanyan, harbored no fondness for the man.

Ning Zhuo shook his head, assuring Qing Chi that he had resolved the matter and secured Yang Sanyan's support. He also mentioned his plans to join the Myriad Manifestations Sect, urging her not to worry.

Tears welled up in Qing Chi's eyes. "Little Ma, I know how much you've sacrificed for me. To appease Yang Sanyan, you've sold yourself - sold yourself to the Myriad Manifestations Sect!"

"That Yang Sanyan must have coveted your talent. Capturing me was just a way to force your hand..."

In Qing Chi's eyes, Jiao Ma was a priceless treasure, coveted by all.

Just as the White Paper City Lord had done, Yang Sanyan also tried to persuade Ning Zhuo to join his faction.

Ning Zhuo was speechless. He could only offer a few comforting words to Qing Chi, assuring her that joining the Myriad Manifestations Sect would lead to a brighter future.

Qing Chi immediately declared that she would also attend the Flying Cloud Assembly and cultivate alongside Jiao Ma.

Ning Zhuo's scalp tingled. Naturally, he didn't want to spend every day with Qing Chi. He swiftly changed the subject. "By the way, Miss Qing Chi, have you gained any insights from your recent studies of military manuals?"

Ning Zhuo asked casually, but Qing Chi tilted her head proudly and announced, "Oh, you noticed! I've grasped another military system."

Ning Zhuo eagerly pressed for details.

Qing Chi touched her nose and explained, "I observed the exorbitant resources our army consumes. This inspired me to devise a system called 'A Decade's Preparation for a Single Campaign'..."

She elaborated on the system, leaving Ning Zhuo secretly impressed.

"Qing Chi's talent for military strategy is truly exceptional!"

Comparing himself, Ning Zhuo realized he hadn't yet comprehended even a single military system, while Qing Chi had already mastered two.

Following this good news came a grave report.

Sun Lingtong, using the Life Hanging Thread to relay military intelligence, warned, "Little Zhuo, the situation is dire! The Underworld army is mobilizing on a massive scale. The final battle may be imminent."
