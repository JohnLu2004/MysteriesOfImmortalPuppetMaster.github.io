Chapter 258: Shadow Demon Cultivator?!

After Fei Si reported back and received approval from the Tomb, he hurriedly returned to Cloud City.

Upon meeting Zhu Xuanji and Song Fuli again, he first transmitted a message to the former: "Lord Zhu, with Fire Persimmon Immortal City and Lava Immortal Palace under siege, we must unite and collaborate to overcome this crisis. We still need to leverage the strength of Song Fuli and his group to better resist the beast tide and navigate this predicament. I've obtained authorization from Lord Meng Kui to negotiate compensation with Song Fuli. However, I'm afraid he might demand exorbitantly... Alas, our situation is indeed passive. Therefore, I hope you, Lord Zhu, will lend a hand, considering we are all citizens of the Southern Bean Kingdom!"

Zhu Xuanji nodded and quickly transmitted back: "I serve in the same court as Meng Kui, and we are one. Now, as we are in the same boat, I must exert my efforts. Rest assured, I will also participate in the negotiations. I have the authority to make some decisions regarding the royal family's assets." Whether from his own stance or the recent secret verbal agreement, Zhu Xuanji actively engaged in the negotiations.

With Zhu Xuanji's support, Fei Si secretly breathed a sigh of relief.

He invited Song Fuli to the City Lord's Mansion and also invited Zhu Xuanji to accompany him, initiating a negotiation.

It was evidently impossible to trace the stolen treasures and return them to the Cloud Merchants within two days.

The City Lord's Mansion also wanted to ally with the Cloud Merchants to resist the beast tide.

To show sincerity, they decided to negotiate compensation to win over Song Fuli.

The negotiation was arduous, with the three parties entangled, and the situation was quite complex.

On the surface, Zhu Xuanji and Fei Si joined forces to negotiate with Song Fuli.

In secret, Zhu Xuanji and Song Fuli had a tacit understanding, both wanting the City Lord's Mansion to pay more.

After two hours, the compensation negotiation finally reached a conclusion.

Loud laughter from Song Fuli echoed from the reception hall.

Fei Si's face was extremely grim.

The City Lord's Mansion paid a huge price, and he almost couldn't uphold the bottom line left by Meng Kui.

Zhu Xuanji wiped the sweat from his forehead, as he also represented the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family and paid a significant price.

Song Fuli was insatiable!

Not only could he legitimately participate in the competition for the Lava Immortal Palace, but he also took advantage of the beast tide to make the City Lord's Mansion and the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family pay a high price for their assistance.

In the end, the pit of the stolen treasures was completely filled, and he even made a considerable profit!

The three parties finalized the details and quickly signed the contract.

A knock on the door sounded, and a cultivator from the City Lord's Mansion came to report.

At this time, the report must be about a major event.

Fei Si thought there was a problem with the city defense and hurriedly let the subordinate in, only to hear about "warehouse guards embezzling and dereliction of duty."

It turned out that with the beast attacking the city and Fire Persimmon Immortal City on the defensive, Fei Si thought of mobilizing fire persimmons to create explosive items on a large scale as a trump card in a critical moment.

However, when the subordinate went to retrieve fire persimmons from the warehouse, they found that a massive amount of fire persimmons had vanished!

Since the Fire Persimmon Festival, the warehouse had been sealed, with only the management personnel allowed to enter and exit.

Thus, suspicion directly pointed to the warehouse manager.

If it wasn't him embezzling, who else could it be?

This immediately infuriated Fei Si.

"Good, good, very good indeed!"

"At this critical juncture, embezzlement and corruption, truly bringing glory to my City Lord's Mansion." Fei Si was so angry that his face turned pale.

He regretted letting the subordinate in, exposing this matter to Zhu Xuanji and Song Fuli.

Especially Song Fuli, who once again cast a distrustful glance.

"I was really muddle-headed, handling official business in front of outsiders!" "Alas..."

Fei Si sighed, the negotiation had truly exhausted him, and his mind was not in the right state.

At this moment, he was instead relieved that they had already agreed on the compensation and alliance plan and signed the contract.

Otherwise, Song Fuli might have looked down on the City Lord's Mansion even more due to this incident, demanding even more exorbitant prices.

Given the situation, to salvage his reputation, Fei Si ordered: "Bring that embezzling subordinate up!"

Soon, the subordinate was brought in, kneeling before Fei Si and the three Golden Core cultivators.

"Speak! How did you embezzle? What method did you use to forge the formation records? Who did you sell that batch of fire essence to?!" Fei Si shouted.

The Qi Refining stage warehouse manager was so frightened that he was trembling, crying out: "Lord, Lord Fei Si, please see clearly!"

"I am innocent, I didn't embezzle anything."

"Those fire persimmons, since the festival, were directly sent to the warehouse through the teleportation formation."

"I only checked them, I didn't dare to touch them at all."

Fei Si's gaze was sharp: "Still trying to argue!"

"Then why did you check multiple times, yet only today, when using the fire persimmons, did you discover the massive shortage?"

The subordinate wept: "Although I checked daily, I only inspected the surroundings, not realizing the fire persimmon piles had been hollowed out!"

"I am indeed at fault for negligence, but I truly didn't embezzle anything, I swear to the heavens, I didn't touch a single fire persimmon."

The subordinate's cries were sincere.

"Very well, very well, you are quite adept at evading the important points, I suppose you have long anticipated this, constantly exploiting our country's laws, haven't you?" Fei Si's face was dark, leaking killing intent.

Zhu Xuanji sighed softly, seeing that Fei Si wanted to cut through the mess quickly, using this as a warning to restore the City Lord's Mansion's reputation.

This was too hasty.

Zhu Xuanji couldn't stand it, stood up, and said: "I just used a method to see, this person is not lying."

"How many fire persimmons are missing?"

Fei Si's face was dark, staring at Zhu Xuanji like a hawk.

The two exchanged glances for a while, and ultimately, Fei Si, not wanting Song Fuli to see the Southern Bean Kingdom's internal strife, had to take a step back and reported a compromised number.

Zhu Xuanji's eyes shone with golden light, immediately discerning that Fei Si was not speaking the truth, he was lying.

Clearly, in this situation, Fei Si could only report a smaller number.

This made Zhu Xuanji's brows furrow deeply, and his face darkened: "So many?!"

The loss of fire persimmons was significant, especially the loss of many millennia-old and century-old fire persimmons.

Fire persimmons are akin to fire essence, and if used by someone with ill intentions, they could cause immense harm to the Lava Immortal Palace, especially during the constant beast tide assaults.

If the fire persimmons exploded, causing the frontline to collapse and allowing the beasts to rush into the city, it would inevitably lead to heavy casualties.

"This matter must be thoroughly investigated, it cannot be ignored!" Zhu Xuanji stared at the subordinate, his eyes glowing with golden light.

This was truly terrible news, even more important than the theft of the Cloud Merchants' goods.

Song Fuli spoke: "To easily steal from the City Lord's Mansion's treasury and only be discovered now, could it be the same group of people?"

"Void Sect?" Fei Si's eyes flashed with brilliance, "It's highly possible!"

If not for Zhu Xuanji, he would have immediately confirmed it.

No matter what, he couldn't bear this burden, it would affect his career!

Zhu Xuanji, however, had principles, saying: "An investigation is still needed to determine the true culprit!"

He originally thought that after resolving the Cloud Merchants' issue, he could immediately return to the Lava Immortal Palace, but he didn't expect the fire persimmon theft case to arise.

He rushed to the warehouse for an on-site investigation.

Under the Heaven-Piercing Eyes, almost nothing could escape his sight.

Soon, Zhu Xuanji made a shocking discovery!

"Shadow Demon Cultivator?!"

Through the Tracing Origin Technique, Zhu Xuanji "saw" a scene that had occurred here.

A Shadow Demon Cultivator hid in the fire persimmon warehouse, took a large amount of fire persimmons, then shrouded himself in black smoke, resembling an ink python, and easily slipped out of the warehouse.

The warehouse had six layers of formations, but the ink python moved freely through the gaps between the formations!

"So, the Shadow Demon Cultivator has been hiding here all along? But is he the original Shadow Demon Cultivator?"

During the Golden Core chaos, several Shadow Demon Cultivators emerged.

Zhu Xuanji couldn't determine the true identity of this Shadow Demon Cultivator based solely on this past image.

"Is it the Meng family committing theft under the guise of guardianship? Or is the City Lord's Mansion merely a victim?"

In an instant, a fog clouded Zhu Xuanji's mind.

Seeing Zhu Xuanji's changing expression, Fei Si urgently inquired: "Lord Zhu, have you discovered any crucial clues?"

"There is a discovery, the one who stole the fire persimmons is a Shadow Demon Cultivator!" Zhu Xuanji thought for a moment and decided to be frank.

Fei Si's eyes widened: "Shadow Demon Cultivator?!"

He was stunned for a moment, then realized: "Wait, doesn't that mean anyone could be involved?"

After the Golden Core chaos, the identity of the Shadow Demon Cultivator became so common that anyone could play the role.

Zhu Xuanji slowly nodded.

He said: "Fire Persimmon Mountain often trembles, even with the Lava Immortal Palace suppressing the mountain base, it's unavoidable."

"The city-protecting formation hasn't changed for years, and due to mountain tremors, repairs are frequently needed."

"When the six-layer formation was initially set up, they were tightly connected, with no space for formation."

"But over time, due to mountain tremors, gaps inevitably appear."

"The Shadow Demon Cultivator used these gaps to enter and exit the warehouse."

Fei Si's eyes widened again: "Such narrow gaps, can a person fit through?"

Zhu Xuanji sighed: "It seems some kind of technique or divine ability was used."

Fei Si was speechless.

After a moment of silence, he fully understood.

Immediately, Fei Si deeply bowed to Zhu Xuanji, sincerely expressing that the City Lord's Mansion was definitely a victim, and this was not a self-directed act.

Zhu Xuanji's eyes shone with golden light, constantly watching Fei Si.

"I know you didn't lie. However, just because you didn't do it doesn't mean the City Lord's Mansion didn't, right?" Zhu Xuanji transmitted.

Fei Si was speechless.

Zhu Xuanji implied that Meng Kui might have secretly arranged it, keeping it from Fei Si.

This was indeed possible.

After all, using demonic pawns in the righteous path is taboo, the fewer people who know, the better.

If such a thing existed, Fei Si would rather not know!

The more he knew about such secrets, the more dangerous it was for him.

Fei Si subconsciously glanced at the top of Fire Persimmon Mountain, then realized this action was inappropriate.

He frowned, immediately assuring that he would issue orders for a thorough investigation of the frontline and key areas of the Immortal City.

"But as for the Lava Immortal Palace, I'm powerless." Fei Si then sighed deeply, using a helpless tone to request Zhu Xuanji to follow this lead to the end!

Zhu Xuanji also sighed: "I need to consider comprehensively."
