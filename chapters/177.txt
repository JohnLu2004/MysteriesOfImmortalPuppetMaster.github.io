Chapter 177: Battle is Merely a Tool

"The three families are planning to jointly attack Yuan Dasheng..." Ning Zhuo took this matter very seriously.

The situation was unclear, and Ai Dasheng couldn't exert his full strength.

Due to the rescue of Sun Lingtong, many of Yuan Dasheng's techniques were exposed.

For instance, the Shattering Sun Hand, the Backhand Grab, and the Righteous Bone Golden Firmness.

Of course, the Immortal Material aspect should still be confidential.

Most people would think it was made of excellent materials, allowing Yuan Dasheng to resist the Ghost Fire's scorching.

This could be inferred from the reactions of Meng Kui and others after the battle.

If they had discovered the spiritual nature and Immortal Material, they would have conducted a frantic city-wide search instead of the current calm observation.

Even so, it was best not to display the Immortal Material Righteous Bone Golden Firmness on the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng again.

Ning Zhuo also considered that the Golden Blood Battle Ape's body was made of low-grade materials, so its performance couldn't be expected to improve much.

"How can I maximize Yuan Dasheng's strength?"

While pondering this question, Ning Zhuo couldn't help but feel fortunate—luckily, he had focused on the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra over the past ten days.

"By forging spiritual mechanical components through the Fire Burial Sutra, I can enhance Yuan Dasheng's combat power! This should be the way to break the impasse."

"But why are the three families confident they can challenge Yuan Dasheng?"

"The Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai has also appeared, so in the minds of the three families, they will also consider Cheng Bai. The source of their confidence is probably the preparation room, right?" In the Lava Immortal Palace, after Room No. 3, there was a preparation room.

The preparation room contained numerous mechanical platforms and tools.

By paying some spirit stones, one could repair puppet bodies.

In the subsequent two preparation rooms, spirit stones could also be used to purchase many low-grade materials for modifying puppet bodies to some extent.

The strength of the human race lies in wisdom, and the field where wisdom can be most effectively utilized is tools.

A fulcrum and a lever can allow a person to lift objects far beyond their strength limit.

This is the simplest mechanism, yet it has the power to move hearts.

Cultivation in a hundred arts is about how to use various resources more reasonably and cultivatively.

Among the hundred arts of cultivation, mechanical arts can be considered the pinnacle of tools.

Ning Zhuo's gaze deepened.

"The reformation teams of the three families exploring the Immortal Palace are now all at the peak of the third level."

"These days, they have been actively practicing mechanical arts, conducting extensive exercises on puppet bodies and hanging rings, becoming extremely familiar with them. Now, they plan to make good use of the preparation room, fully unleash their creativity, and burst out with strong combat power to overthrow Yuan Dasheng's suppression in one fell swoop." Ning Zhuo's mind was sharp, and he quickly grasped the key point of the three families' joint action.

It was the preparation room!

"The current question is, should I let Yuan Dasheng appear in the first three levels in advance to block them?"

The joint action of the three families actually had a fatal flaw.

As long as Yuan Dasheng intercepted them in advance, they wouldn't even be able to enter the first preparation room.

However, this simplest and most violent answer was not the optimal solution to this problem!

"If I do this, it might work once. But if it happens two or three times, the three families will become highly suspicious due to Yuan Dasheng's precise interceptions. If they can't break through, the three families might even cooperate with the City Lord's Mansion!" This was entirely possible.

On the path of soul entry into the Immortal Palace, the City Lord's Mansion had the most significant advantage.

The three families united to compete with Meng Chong and others but were always at a disadvantage.

Meng Chong and others dominated the preparation room rankings (as they saw it), and the three families, due to Ai Dasheng, couldn't fully utilize their numerical advantage.

If Ning Zhuo suppressed them too much, causing the three families to fall into despair, they would inevitably seek the assistance of the City Lord's Mansion.

Would the City Lord's Mansion agree?

It's hard to say.

If there were only the soul entry route into the Immortal Palace, Ning Zhuo believed the City Lord's Mansion would be unlikely to agree to cooperate.

But now, the physical entry route into the Immortal Palace was also an option.

On this route, the City Lord's Mansion had little competitiveness and was almost insignificant.

The dominant forces were the Zhou family and the Zheng family.

And the top one was Zhu Xuanji.

He had previously contributed three quasi-Golden Core Stage mechanical constructs in one go, making him the current number one.

"For the City Lord's Mansion, they need Meng Chong to progress faster, the faster, the better, to surpass Zhu Xuanji's progress!"

"Yuan Dasheng repeatedly repelling Meng Chong is a significant obstacle. Therefore, first jointly attacking Yuan Dasheng, defeating him, and uncovering his internal mechanical structure is highly motivating for the City Lord's Mansion. Even if Yuan Dasheng is repaired by the Immortal Palace and reintroduced into the trial levels, they would have obtained crucial information to defend against and target him."

"So, the key point for the City Lord's Mansion's decision is—whether the combined strength of the three families will surpass Meng Chong's if they eliminate the monkey mechanism. If it does, they won't agree to cooperate. If it doesn't, they will likely cooperate!"

Currently, Yuan Dasheng was already struggling to face Meng Chong alone.

Once the four major forces united, Yuan Dasheng would face a massive team led by Meng Chong, with other geniuses assisting, and the reformation team numbering over a hundred.

Even if the Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai were brought in, exhausting its last bit of spirituality to participate, the outcome would likely be more defeats than victories.

"So, letting them enter the preparation room, allowing them to fully prepare for battle, and then letting Yuan Dasheng appear is the correct approach?"

"More accurately, this battle cannot let the three families suffer a crushing defeat. Yuan Dasheng must win but leave them with some false hope—as if with just a bit more effort next time, they could defeat Yuan Dasheng."

If Ai Dasheng appeared too strong, the three families would despair and still seek cooperation with the City Lord's Mansion.

The City Lord's Mansion would then see the true strength of Ai Dasheng and feel pressured, prompting them to decide to cooperate with Meng Kui and Meng Chong.

Only by making the three families believe they were just a step away from success would they not seek cooperation with the City Lord's Mansion.

They would desire to break through Ai Dasheng themselves and let the repaired Yuan Dasheng continue to obstruct Meng Chong.

"Only in such a situation would it be most beneficial to me."

Ning Zhuo felt the pressure.

The complex situation required him to pursue a complex outcome.

Yuan Dasheng's defeat was unacceptable.

Ai Dasheng's overwhelming victory was also unacceptable.

He had to achieve a narrow victory while giving the three families some false hope.

Only by doing this could Ning Zhuo truly be the master of the situation.

"Battle is merely an action. It is a tool."

"Just like not long ago, Zhou Zeshen actively proposed a sparring match with me. He used the tool of battle to accumulate friendship and enhance our relationship."

"And the battle between Yuan Dasheng and the three families is my tool to maintain control over the Lava Immortal Palace!"

Ning Zhuo shared this information and his analysis of the situation with Sun Lingtong.

Sun Lingtong praised him and sighed, "Xiao Zhuo, your understanding of the various forces and your grasp of human nature are more proficient than mine. In this aspect, I am increasingly reassured."

Ning Zhuo humbly replied, "Not at all. I still have many shortcomings."

Sun Lingtong said, "In that case, I will also put in more effort recently to unlock Cheng Bai's storage bag!"

After being wanted, Sun Lingtong stayed in one of the few underground bases, relocating every once in a while.

His injuries had long since healed.

Usually, besides cultivating and exploring the Immortal Palace, he focused on studying Cheng Bai's storage bag.

During Ning Zhuo's intervention in the black market, he had risked appearing in the city to give orders to the Turtle Breath Gang's leader.

That was his only outing.

With the development of cultivation to this day, cultivators' storage tools were equipped with verification, defense, and self-destruct measures.

Back then, when Ning Zhuo killed the three ghosts of the Huang family, he had also pondered for a long time before opening the three storage bags.

At that time, a small ghost head flew out of the bag, attempting to attack Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo was not careless and had prepared in advance, directly killing the small ghost.

As a disciple of a major demonic sect, Cheng Bai's storage bag had high defense specifications.

Sun Lingtong, being only at the Foundation Establishment Stage, had been diligently trying to unlock Cheng Bai's storage bag.

Although there was progress, it was very slow.

According to Ning Zhuo's speculation, the storage bag was so tightly guarded because it was very important to Cheng Bai.

It likely contained many of Cheng Bai's personal items.

These items, under the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra, would add spirituality to the mechanical puppet Cheng Bai.

Ning Zhuo nodded, "If the Netherworld Envoy Cheng Bai can participate in this battle, I will be more confident. But don't take too many risks, Brother Sun."

"After Cheng Bai's death, there has been no movement from the Soul Devouring Sect, which is quite unusual."

"It's very likely that their people have already arrived."

Sun Lingtong understood the gravity of the situation and nodded, "I understand!"

He showed a solemn expression, "The hook-nosed and triangular-eyed demon cultivators from the Soul Devouring Sect are imprisoned by the City Lord's Mansion. I'm not worried about them—they are bait set up by the City Lord's Mansion. What I am more concerned about is Han Ming."

"Since that battle, Han Ming has not appeared. If she secretly contacted the Soul Devouring Sect, the threat to us would be even greater."

"Sigh... we can only take it one step at a time." Ning Zhuo sighed.

After taking control of the black market, he paid close attention to collecting information in this regard, but so far, there had been no results.

A few days later, Ning Zhuo indeed received a notification to go to the Zhou family.

In an underground hall, the entire reformation team of the three families gathered.

The heads of the three families appeared together, officially announcing the start of a new joint action!

"I've long been displeased with that mechanical ape."

"With the three families united, and led by five geniuses, we will surely avenge our previous defeat."

"These days, my mechanical arts have improved a lot. I am no longer the same as before!"

"Hahaha, let's give it our all." The crowd enthusiastically exchanged words, their morale high.

The heads of the three families made the following arrangements: they sealed the underground hall for several days of special training.

During this period, all reformation team members would eat and sleep there, and random outings were prohibited.

After the meeting, Zhou Zeshen, with a smile, approached Ning Zhuo, "Brother Yu, come with me. We need to discuss the specific battle plan."

Ning Zhuo smiled slightly and initiated the conversation, "Brother Zhou, thank you for the rivet rapid-fire crossbow. It was very useful."

Zhou Zeshen laughed heartily, "Next time we spar, I will definitely bring your mechanical monkey blueprint, Brother Ning."

"This way, please." Zhou Zeshen gestured with his arm.

Ning Zhuo: "Please."
