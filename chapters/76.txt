Chapter 76: I Am an Official

After thinking it through, Ning Zhuo started his plan.

He spent large sums of money for the capture of wild monkeys, then hired a demonic cultivator to poison the Monkey Head Gang’s monkey pets, and finally staged a failed assassination attempt on Yuan Er.

Under this pressure, Yuan Er and Yuan Dasheng focused wholly on defending themselves, allowing Ning Zhuo’s first step to succeed.

Riding the momentum, Ning Zhuo played the villain in front of Fei Si and led the man to misjudge the situation. Ning Zhuo then voluntarily gave up forty percent of his profits to obtain the corpses of the Monkey Head Gang’s monkeys.

He gathered and refined their essence blood, extracting blood energy of the same origin as Yuan Dasheng.

He then deliberately participated in the rush job at Flying Disk Workshop and personally crafted a large number of low-quality explosive fire monkeys, secretly using the Demonic Pollution Blood Sinew Technique to embed the extracted blood energy into the mechanical monkeys.

On the day of the Fire Persimmon Festival, Ning Zhuo was stationed midway up the mountain and hidden by the formation. He took the risk of using his heart seal to control the mechanical monkeys and incited a riot, deliberately sending them to attack Yuan Er.

The mechanical monkeys were destroyed by Fei Si activating the formation, but the lurking blood energy had already attached itself to Yuan Er.

Frightened by the attack, Yuan Er regrouped with Yuan Dasheng, leading to Yuan Dasheng being polluted by the blood energy.

Ning Zhuo’s gamble paid off!

Sure enough, Yuan Dasheng’s perception wasn’t sharp enough, or maybe it was too worried about Yuan Er. In any case, it failed to notice that a tiny amount of blood energy from the same origin had entered its body.

Though this blood energy was minimal in quantity, it managed to affect Yuan Dasheng’s fingers at the critical moment and caused the “mistake”.

The thousand-year area of Fire Persimmon Forest exploded!

Ning Zhuo’s trap was so exquisitely designed that even Zhu Xuanji’s Golden Pupils failed to detect the blood energy.

Right under his nose, Ning Zhuo’s scheme succeeded!

However, the fact that Zhu Xuanji saved Yuan Dasheng momentarily disrupted Ning Zhuo’s mental state.

He almost thought he’d been exposed.

Yuan Dasheng survived, clinging to a sliver of life. What worried Ning Zhuo even more was that Yuan Dasheng’s body was still intact, not blown to pieces as he had expected.

Most importantly, Yuan Dasheng’s two hands remained unharmed, with all ten fingers still intact. This made Ning Zhuo realize he had left a flaw behind!

At the time, Zhu Xuanji was focused on saving Yuan Dasheng and didn’t care about minor details. The blood energy of the same origin was perfectly hidden, so he didn’t notice anything suspicious in the fingers.

But if he conducted a follow-up examination and looked more closely, would he really miss it?

Ning Zhuo didn’t dare to take that risk.

So Ning Zhuo had to eliminate Yuan Dasheng quickly and erase the flaw.

Ning Zhuo couldn’t act under his own name. He was merely at the Qi Refining stage and couldn’t bear the possible backlash from Zhu Xuanji if discovered.

“I can act under Sir Fei Si’s name. That way, Zhu Xuanji would hesitate to act against Fei Si and assume I was only the executor, not the mastermind!”

Ning Zhuo threw himself into the fray, disregarding his safety to successfully persuade Yuan Er. In the end, he won!

Just as he predicted, once Zhu Xuanji learned of the incident, he assumed Fei Si was the mastermind. Even better, Fei Si himself believed that he was the mastermind.

“In the end, I pulled it off!” Inside the Flying Disk Workshop, Ning Zhuo sighed deeply.

Regaining his composure, his breathing became much steadier and his emotions eased.

Zhu Xuanji and the others didn’t know that they had been just a hair’s breadth away from discovering the key clue.

But that hair’s breadth was enough to bury the truth.

A tiny mistake led to an error of a thousand li.

“For now, I can still stay hidden.” Ning Zhuo wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and let out a light breath.

It really hadn’t been easy.

No fighting occurred during the whole process, but it was like walking a tightrope along the edge of a cliff. There were multiple moments when Ning Zhuo almost lost control of his mental state.

He stood up. “Old Chen, I’d like to handle Yuan Dasheng’s corpse personally. This is a task that Sir Fei Si assigned to me. I want to show more initiative.”

Even though the essence blood had already been extracted and the flaw had been erased, Ning Zhuo remained cautious. He didn’t want Yuan Dasheng’s body to fall into someone else’s hands.

“You…” Chen Cha sighed deeply. “Fine. I’ll pack it up for you.”

“Get some rest. The preprocessing of the corpse is complete, and preserving it for a long time won’t be an issue.

“There’s no need to rush. It’s not worth working yourself to exhaustion.”

Ning Zhuo bowed in gratitude. “Thank you, Old Chen!”

...

Fei Si and Zhu Xuanji’s trio returned to Fire Persimmon Forest and continued digging the ground.

They dug far deeper than just three chi, going down as much as three zhang. At the same time, several Golden Core cultivators took turns using all kinds of spells and magic artifacts to investigate.

Nothing happened.

Fei Si’s face was gloomy. He had a feeling that the black shadow demonic cultivator had indeed escaped and wouldn’t return.

Since it had come to this, he had to keep digging. Even if it meant turning the mountain upside down, he wouldn’t hesitate.

The logic was simple.

Since he had failed his mission, he had to at least give the appearance of working hard to tell the City Lord that he had put in the effort even if he hadn’t gotten results.

“This time, I also managed to pay back Zhu Xuanji and make him look bad, so it shouldn’t be too much of a problem.”

Fei Si reflected on his current situation and naturally thought of Ning Zhuo.

His eyes narrowed slightly, and he felt somewhat conflicted.

From today’s events, he had seen Ning Zhuo’s talent.

The boy was only at the Qi Refining stage, but still dared to storm into the Monkey Head Gang’s headquarters and coerce a Foundation Establishment cultivator like Yuan Er into abandoning Yuan Dasheng. From this, it was clear that Ning Zhuo had both ability and courage!

Fei Si also knew very well that Ning Zhuo actions were motivated by personal gains.

But he didn’t mind. In fact, this made him feel that he understood Ning Zhuo better and could control him. It gave him a sense of safety and confidence.

These feelings made him appreciate this youth from the Ning Clan even more.

“He really reminds me of myself when I was young.

“And he’s got sharp instincts too!

“I’m just not sure if he was the one who caused the mechanical monkeys to go out of control and attack Yuan Er during the Fire Persimmon Festival…”

Fei Si was no fool. He had always kept this suspicion in mind.

In his eyes, Ning Zhuo had a strong motive!

Of course, he had also listened to Ning Zhuo and Chen Cha’s explanation regarding the incident. When he first received the report from his attendants, he indeed found it reasonable.

But his suspicion never completely disappeared.

“I’m not learned in mechanical arts. There might be some method that would allow Ning Zhuo to control the mechanical monkeys.

“Even if there isn’t, isn’t there Chen Cha as well? He’s at the Foundation Establishment stage.

“If Chen Cha wasn’t the accomplice, then Ning Zhuo could have also offered a high price to hire a demonic cultivator…”

As an experienced official, Fei Si was naturally suspicious of everything regardless of evidence.

Of course, he was more inclined to believe that the mechanical monkeys had been secretly controlled by the black shadow demonic cultivator, and that the latter had successfully escaped that very day right in front of countless onlookers.

The reason he preferred this explanation was simple — it worked best in his favor.

Yes, the black shadow demonic cultivator had fooled all the Golden Core cultivators and was overwhelmingly mighty!

If that was the case, Fei Si’s failure would be much easier for the City Lord to accept.

Just look! Even Zhu Xuanji with his Golden Pupils failed to uncover the black shadow demonic cultivator. I, Fei Si, was simply powerless against such an opponent.

Fei Si began racking his brain for ways to reinforce this theory and how to report it to the City Lord.

As for what the actual truth was, he didn’t care in the slightest.

After managing Fire Persimmon Immortal City’s affairs for so many years, had he not already handled enough wrongful and mistaken cases?

"I am an official, not someone from the Divine Investigation Bureau!"

Seeking the truth was Zhu Xuanji’s goal and responsibility. Fei Si only wanted to preserve the existing order of Fire Persimmon Immortal City, obey City Lord Meng Kui’s commands, and protect his own authority and interests.
