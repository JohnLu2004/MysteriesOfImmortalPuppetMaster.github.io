Chapter 392: Fake Wine

Zhu Xuanji held Ning Zhuo’s letter, feeling as if it were burning hot in his hands!

Although he wanted to throw it away, he recalled that when he returned to the capital for duty and met with the emperor, he was directly ordered to represent the Nandou royal family in handling the Lava Immortal Palace’s matter.

But Zhu Xuanji felt that he was just being pushed to the frontline by the emperor to interact with the Destined One!

Gritting his teeth, Zhu Xuanji opened the letter with difficulty and scanned its contents with his divine sense—

"Respected Elder Brother Zhu Xuanji:

(Zhu Xuanji: Who's your elder brother? Don't call me that randomly!)

Since our parting, we've been separated by vast distances with scarce news. Days and months have passed swiftly, and it's already been dozens of days. A day apart feels like three autumns, and your demeanor and voice have never left my thoughts.

(Zhu Xuanji: Why do you remember me so clearly? Just forget about me!)

Recalling our time at Lava Immortal Wealth, where we shared the same boat and fought side by side. On Cloud Concealment Mountain, we weathered storms together and formed alliances - truly one of life's great pleasures. Your strategic thinking was profound, your actions unrestrained. I sincerely admired you, and whenever I think of those times, I can't help but reminisce about those scenes, still feeling warmth in my heart. If we could continue our previous connection, it would truly be heaven-sent.

(Zhu Xuanji: Who said we fought side by side? Weren't you just manipulating me? This isn't good, not good at all! What does this kid want my help with now?)

I have a small request. I've long heard of our Nandou country's Spring Longing Wine, known for its fragrant aroma and indescribable excellence. It's truly a worldly treasure. Though I've never tasted it, I've longed for it for a while. I dare ask brother to gift me a jar, to quench my thirst for fine wine and add to our continued friendship.

(Zhu Xuanji: Spring Longing Wine? This kid has developed a taste for wine? Fine, I'll give it to you, just don't trouble me anymore.)

Additionally, there was a great ancient figure named the Five Elements Divine Lord. I'm very interested in this figure, but have limited information at hand. Thus I specially request brother to give me some intelligence about this, to resolve my confusion. If I could learn even a bit, I would be immensely grateful.

(Zhu Xuanji: Five Elements Divine Lord? That's an impressive name, it seems like I've seen it somewhere. Seeking information from me? You're after the Inspection Bureau's archives and records, aren't you? Clever kid, you've asked the right person. I'll give it to you, every bit of it!)

I also wish that in your recent investigations, your thoughts move like lightning, penetrating through all mysteries. May all difficult matters become clear as day, with everything going smoothly, achieving early success. If brother has free time, I wish to invite you to the Ten Thousand Medicine Sect for a gathering, where the scenery is beautiful and the vegetation lush. We could drink fine wine together, reminisce about old times, and discuss new strategies.

Please take care. I hope everything goes smoothly for brother, and hope for an early reunion to fulfill our grand ambitions!

Respectfully,
Ning Zhuo

(Zhu Xuanji: The Ten Thousand Medicines Sect? Oh, there's a large sect there called Ten Thousand Medicines Gate. Wanting me to go to Ten Thousand Medicines Valley? Haha, how could that be possible? Dream on!)

After reading the letter, Zhu Xuanji's forehead was slightly sweating.

He wanted to stay as far away as possible from the Destined one.

Going to the Ten Thousand Medicine Sect?

No way!

I absolutely won't go!

Take the Spring Longing Wine and information about the Five Elements Divine Lord. Take it all!

Please don't bother me.

"Wait, why is Ning Zhuo specifically seeking information about the Five Elements Divine Lord? What has he encountered?"

"Don't think about it, don't think about anything."

"Why get involved with the Destined One's matters?!"

Zhu Xuanji immediately warned himself internally.

He remained fully vigilant as he personally searched through the archives, looking through records, extracting information about the Five Elements Divine Lord, and creating jade slips.

He also used his connections to obtain century-old Spring Longing Wine from the royal treasury.

Finally, he used the postal station's special transmission privileges to send these items to Ning Zhuo at maximum speed.

Ten Thousand Medicines Valley.

Ning Zhuo received the intelligence and was quite pleased.

He sighed to Sun Lingtong: "Old Zhu is a reliable and capable person. I didn't expect him to handle these matters so quickly!"

"For him, it's a small matter, but it's helped me greatly."

"Indeed, we must thank him properly in the future. We'll seek his help again!"

Sun Lingtong replied: "Your Ning family's performance in the Lava Immortal Palace Wealth matter is critical to whether Fire Persimmon Immortal City falls into the Meng family's hands. This is very important to the royal family."

"Little Zhuo, you're now a crucial figure in the Ning family, so of course Zhu Xuanji would take you seriously."

"However, I never expected that in the end, we would become friends with Zhu Xuanji. The twists and turns of worldly fate are truly unexpected."

"But, regarding your investigation into the Five Elements Divine Lord, do you still have doubts?"

Ning Zhuo nodded and hummed in agreement: "I've thoroughly read historical books and classics, yet never heard of the title Five Elements Divine Lord. With such great abilities, he must be an ancient figure."

"The living have yang longevity, the dead have yin longevity. Yang longevity is limited, and yin longevity is likewise. According to normal logic, ancient powerful beings should have exhausted their ten thousand years of yin longevity by now. But I feel that the Five Elements Divine Lord is still alive and kicking. This isn't normal."

"The biggest point of suspension is that after I returned to the Mechanical Dragon, even though I was sober, I still received the Five Elements Divine Lord's transmission of teachings."

"I told this to Linghu Jiu, but even he couldn't explain it."

"There are many strange aspects to this. My receiving the teachings and obtaining the complete 'Five Viscera Temple Spirit Technique' seemed too easy. Moreover, my Five Elements realm advancement is even more valuable than this divine technique."

"I'm still young, but I've read many books. Though my experience is limited, the Lava Immortal Palace was something I planned about for fourteen years."

"To be honest, suddenly receiving such great benefits makes me feel uneasy."

Sun Lingtong shrugged: "What's there to be afraid of? You're not cultivating this divine technique anyway, and your advancement in the Five Elements completely belongs to you - it's a genuine benefit."

"Yin longevity may be limited, but how can we use normal logic to measure a great being like the Five Elements Divine Lord?"

"We're just two Foundation Building juniors, how could we possibly understand the Five Elements Divine Lord's power?"

Ning Zhuo shook his head: "I'd feel more at ease referring to the 'Five Viscera Temple Spirit Technique' in the future if I first conduct a proper investigation and understand the details."

Sun Lingtong nodded: "Yes, such caution is not bad. Let's look together at what the jade slip says."

Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong both projected their divine sense.

They learned all the intelligence about the Five Elements Divine Lord.

As Ning Zhuo had previously guessed, the Five Elements Divine Lord was indeed an ancient figure—

He appeared after the Bloody Remnant Dynasty, at the beginning of the Martial Emperor era!

The Bloody Remnant Dynasty was the first dynasty in history.

A dynasty meant unifying the entire world, controlling all territories.

Throughout world history, there were only three dynasties. The Bloody Remnant Dynasty was the first.

At that time, human cultivators weren't the main characters; demons and monsters roaming freely was the dynasty's most notable characteristic.

After the dynasty's collapse, various forces across the world fell into fighting and slaughter, complete chaos.

Until a man of mixed human, demon, and monster blood ascended to the imperial throne, only then did the world become a place of order.

This man was the Martial Emperor!

In history, he was considered the second emperor.

In the history of the world there were only five empires acknowledged by everyone. The first criterion for being considered an empire was that the empire must occupy at least 80% of the world's territory and have enormous influence as the world's main power.

The Five Elements Divine Lord had a very close relationship with the Martial Emperor, being both friend and foe.

He was extraordinarily talented with a strong personality. Before the Martial Emperor ascended to the throne, they fought enemies side by side, developing a deep bond as battle companions.

The Five Elements Divine Lord's rise to fame came from his battle with the Black River Dragon Demon. At that time, he single-handedly invaded the Black River, fighting until the river ran red, ultimately battling the Dragon Demon for three days and three nights before slaying it. With one person's strength, he swept away an entire demon power, shocking the world.

His peak battle was against the Blood Sea Demon Lord. He led an army, besieging the Blood Sea for years, finally using the Five Elements Demon Slaying Formation he laid a trap for the Blood Sea Demon Lord and killed him. After this battle, he was recognized as second only to the Martial Emperor.

The Five Elements Divine Lord's final battle was the Ten Thousand Demons Mountain Campaign. The Martial Emperor led his army, sweeping across the world, causing demons and monsters to gather at Ten Thousand Demons Mountain.

With demon forces gathered together, the Martial Emperor couldn't break through. The Five Elements Divine Lord was entrusted with the crisis, personally charging into battle. He manifested five spirits, divine light piercing the heavens, engaging in a life-and-death battle with the demons.

Finally, the Martial Emperor's army conquered Ten Thousand Demons Mountain, completely dismantling what was once the highest peak, and the Five Elements Divine Lord died in battle.

This is the official history.

However, according to many clues collected by the Investigation Bureau, archaeological information was gathered and compiled into an unofficial history.

The unofficial history told of a love triangle between two men and one woman.

The two men were the Martial Emperor and Five Elements Divine Lord, and the woman was the Jade Tranquility Immortal Consort.

The two men had traveled the world together in their early years when they met her, both developing romantic feelings. However, ultimately, the Jade Tranquility Immortal Consort married the Martial Emperor.

However, the Martial Emperor had many consorts and was focused on his great enterprise, neglecting the Jade Tranquility Immortal Consort's feelings.

The Five Elements Divine Lord and Jade Tranquility Immortal Consort met frequently in private, eventually being discovered by the Martial Emperor.

The Martial Emperor then schemed to have the Jade Tranquility Immortal Consort captured by demons and taken to Ten Thousand Demons Mountain. The Five Elements Divine Lord recklessly went to rescue her, and ultimately both died together on Ten Thousand Demons Mountain.

This was also why after achieving his great enterprise, the Martial Emperor personally ordered the removal of all records, attempting to bury the matter of the Five Elements Divine Lord and Jade Tranquility Immortal Consort in the river of history, unknown to future generations.

After reading this, Sun Lingtong said: "So the Martial Emperor was this kind of man. Hmph!"

Ning Zhuo pondered: "No wonder I hadn't heard of this person's title. On one hand, he was from ancient times, on the other hand, many records were deliberately erased, so very little was passed down."

The information didn't explain why the Five Elements Divine Lord lived until now, teaching Ning Zhuo in the netherworld.

"Ten Thousand Demons Mountain, Ten Thousand Demons Cave, Ten Thousand Medicines Valley, Ten Thousand Medicines Gate... I never imagined this valley was once the world's highest peak. What was once a holy mountain where ten thousand demons gathered is now just the residence of an ordinary medicine-selling sect. There's no better example of the changes of time," Sun Lingtong sighed endlessly.

Ning Zhuo frowned deeply: "Something's not right, I feel something's strange."

"Big Brother Sun, I need to drink the Meditative Brew again."

Sun Lingtong said: "You can drink, but stay away from the Spirit Concealing Willow."

"Of course I know that," Ning Zhuo nodded.

He directly left the Mechanical Dragon and had Sun Lingtong drive it to shrink into a corner of the cave dwelling, staying far away from Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged on a cushion and solemnly took a sip of the Meditative Brew.

Nothing happened.

He took several more sips.

All remained calm!

Ning Zhuo frowned deeply, and after pondering for a while, called for Hua Guzi.

"Master Ning! You finally summoned me!" Hua Guzi's eyes shone with excitement.

Ning Zhuo waved his hand: "Look at this wine."

Hua Guzi used various methods to test it, finally tasting a sip, and spat: "This wine is poorly made, the recipe is contradictory, it's nothing but fake wine!"

"Young Master, quickly tell me, who dared to fool you with this thing? I'll cut them down to avenge you!"
