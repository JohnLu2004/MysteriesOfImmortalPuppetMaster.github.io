Chapter 613: Military Logistics and System

After Qing Chi and Ning Zhuo left White Paper City Lord's mansion, they immediately gathered everyone together.

Inside the room, Qing Chi proudly displayed the Military Seed to the group.

The Military Spirit, which was a cluster of azure light coalesced into a heart shape, had undergone a dramatic transformation.

It had become a seed the size of an adult's fist, narrow at the top and wide at the bottom. From its pointed tip sprouted numerous delicate paper strips, resembling the rootlets of a germinating seed, fluttering in the slightest breeze.

The entire seed was enveloped in layers of coarse paper money, some white and some yellow.

Between the overlapping layers, a solemn human face could be faintly discerned.

"Is this the Military Seed? I've never seen one before," Jiao Ma's father exclaimed, his eyes wide with curiosity as he scrutinized it closely.

"You actually refined it! Well done, girl!"

Faced with her father's praise, Qing Chi turned a burning gaze toward Ning Zhuo. "Actually, it's all thanks to Little Ma."

Qing Yan's brow furrowed slightly. He sensed that this refinement process had brought his daughter and Jiao Ma closer, marking a significant development in their relationship.

Wen Ruanyu folded his arms, looking utterly unsurprised. "I told you, those two were destined to succeed!"

Qing Yan sensed his words could be misinterpreted and quickly corrected, "The Military Seed has been successfully refined."

"That's wonderful! Truly fantastic!" Jiao Ma's father exclaimed, beaming with delight.

Ning Zhuo glanced at Qing Chi, from whom he had already withdrawn the Life Hanging by a Thread technique. He decided to reserve this divine ability for critical moments to avoid revealing its secrets.

"Now that the Military Seed is refined, let's test it out," he suggested.

Everyone nodded in agreement.

Soon, cultivators from the Qing Clan's Ghostman Race and the Jiao Clan's Human Race were summoned to the area.

Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, Qing Chi stepped forward to face the soldiers.

She retrieved the Military Seed once more and channeled her spiritual energy into it.

The paper money Military Seed rapidly expanded like an inflating balloon. The outermost layer of paper unfurled, rising into the air without any wind.

Individual sheets of paper money began to fall, landing on the cultivators and swiftly adhering to their bodies.

Within moments, countless paper bills enveloped the soldiers, transforming them into humanoid paper effigies.

Qing Chi immediately felt a tremendous suction force emanating from the Military Seed in her hand, rapidly draining her spiritual energy.

"Little Ma!" Qing Chi's expression shifted slightly as she instinctively called out to Ning Zhuo for help.

Everyone had been watching intently. Qing Yan was about to intervene when Ning Zhuo stopped him with a word: "Don't move. I participated in the forging process, and the Military Seed recognizes my spiritual energy."

Ning Zhuo acted swiftly, immediately placing his hand over the Military Seed and channeling his spiritual energy into it, greatly relieving Qing Chi's burden.

Qing Chi exhaled a breath of relief. "Little Ma, thank goodness you're here!"

Ning Zhuo's expression remained calm. "Qing Chi, focus. This is our first time using the Military Seed."

Qing Chi nodded, savoring the word "our" and feeling a surge of sweetness.

Qing Yan: ...

However, Ning Zhuo's expression soon changed as well.

His spiritual energy was also running low.

And this was just the beginning!

Fortunately, Ning Zhuo had a large supply of Spirit Stones and Medicinal Pills. He immediately replenished his reserves, maintaining his spiritual energy at a stable level.

This situation persisted for half a day before finally subsiding.

The paper money clinging to the cultivators began to fall, disintegrating mid-air into countless paper shreds that ultimately vanished completely.

The changes in the cultivators were visible to the naked eye.

They became lean and wiry. The exposed skin of the Jiao Clan cultivators turned deathly pale, while the skin of the Qing Clan Ghostman Race became even darker and more profound.

Their bodies now contained a significant amount of yin energy, yet it coexisted harmoniously with their physical forms, showing no signs of rejection.

Upon careful examination with their divine sense, Ning Zhuo and the others discovered that the cultivators' bodies, souls, and even their three dantians had undergone subtle transformations.

Though the extent of these changes was minimal, the direction of their evolution was strikingly consistent across all individuals.

"I've also learned two new spells," one cultivator volunteered.

"Me too! It's like they were directly imprinted into my mind."

"Why did I only get one?"

Differences between cultivators persisted. Even with identical cultivation methods, their results varied.

Qing Chi inquired further and identified the two spells as the Paper Armor Technique and the Yin Crossing Technique.

As its name suggested, the Paper Armor Technique allowed cultivators to summon layers of talisman paper to envelop their bodies, enhancing their defenses.

The Yin Crossing Technique enabled soldiers to adapt and survive in environments saturated with yin energy.

"If we continue cultivating them with the Military Seed method, they should comprehend more techniques. This might even include methods for traversing the yin and yang realms," Ning Zhuo speculated.

"Little Ma, you're so clever! That must be it. But does every cultivation process require such a tremendous effort?" Qing Chi asked.

Ning Zhuo fell silent.

This wasn't just about expending effort. To support this cultivation process, he had spent a considerable amount of Spirit Stones and Medicinal Pills.

"Still," Ning Zhuo thought, observing the assembled cultivators, "having a Military Seed truly makes things far more convenient and advanced."

"This investment was absolutely worth it!"

Ning Zhuo recalled the Three Generals Camp.

Liu Er, Guan Hong, and Zhang Hei had to exhaust themselves training their subordinates, only to produce ordinary soldiers.

But with a Military Seed, the transformation was fundamentally different!

The cultivators' souls and bodies had undergone profound enhancements and alterations. In this regard, Military Seeds were similar to the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat, the Underworld Punishment Codex, and other methods that strengthened a cultivator's foundation.

Though focused on a single purpose, the Military Seed's effects were comprehensive, transforming both the physical body and the soul.

Ning Zhuo's thoughts drifted to the Red Flower Camp. "Does the Red Flower Camp have a corresponding Military Seed?"

"If you want to avoid such strenuous effort, there's another way," Li Xiangshang interjected.

Noticing everyone's attention, he continued, "This involves the subsequent steps. Once the Military Seed is successfully refined, the next step is Military Logistics!"

"We need to invest substantial resources into the Military Seed to ensure its robust growth."

"Once the Military Seed has a solid foundation, it will no longer require us to constantly infuse it with spiritual energy. It will be able to cultivate itself through cycles of growth."

"In fact, this is the most correct way to use it."

Qing Chi asked, "What resources are needed?"

Li Xiangshang replied, "Basically, anything of value will do. Spirit Stones, for example."

"Of course, there are also some special requirements."

"Since this Military Seed corresponds to Paper Money Spirit Envoys, it undoubtedly has unique military logistics needs. Meeting these needs will accelerate and enhance the growth of the Military Seed's foundation."

Qing Chi frowned. "But I can't sense any specific logistics requirements."

Li Xiangshang explained, "That's likely because the Military Seed has only just been refined and hasn't been cultivated to a certain level yet. That's why you can't sense them."

"Haha."

"This is also my first time assisting in refining a Military Seed, so I'm not entirely clear on the details myself."

Even so, this was enough.

Li Xiangshang's words provided the group with a clear direction forward.

But that was precisely the problem.

Ning Zhuo and the others frowned.

They had already scraped the bottom of the barrel to refine the Military Seed.

Even that had only been possible thanks to the joint support of the White Paper City Lord and General Luo Si.

Now, they needed even more resources!

The difficulty of building an army was truly terrifying.

To put it simply, it all came down to money.

A substantial amount of cultivation resources was still needed to fully develop the Military Seed.

But Ning Zhuo had nearly exhausted his personal wealth.

Where would the remaining funds come from?

Wen Ruanyu said, "Now that we've reached this point, I'll report back immediately. I hope the White Paper City Lord will generously provide support."

After all, establishing a proper army would greatly benefit the city.

Li Xiangshang emphasized, "Cultivating the Military Seed isn't just about teaching spells; it's also about imparting experience."

"All combat experience gained by the new army will be stored within the Military Seed."

"When training new recruits in the future, we can directly instill this experience into them, rapidly transforming them into seasoned veterans."

"Oh, right."

"During the Military Logistics phase, Qing Chi, you'll also need to study Military Manuals."

"The goal isn't to master every tactical detail, but to determine the optimal Military System for our forces."

"Once your Military Strategist realm is sufficient, you can add new restrictions to the Military Seed. These restrictions, derived from the Military Manuals, form the bedrock of military construction."

"Military Logistics and Military Systems complement each other. It's best if both progress in tandem."

Qing Chi groaned, clutching her head. "What? More books?"

Ning Zhuo turned to Li Xiangshang. "I participated in the Military Seed's creation and served as deputy commander. Can I add restrictions as well?"

Li Xiangshang replied, "That should be possible, but it would likely require Qing Chi's approval and cooperation."

This condition was as good as no condition at all.

"The realm of a Military Strategist..." Ning Zhuo murmured, "It seems I need to study more Military Manuals."

Qing Chi nodded. "Little Ma, I'm counting on you for this."

"No, you need to study them too," Ning Zhuo replied. "I'm ultimately just the deputy commander. You're the rightful commander."

Qing Chi looked distressed. "Then can I be the deputy commander and you take the lead, Little Ma?"

"Ahem! Ahem!" Qing Yan coughed violently.

Ning Zhuo's expression turned solemn. "Qing Chi, stop joking. You're the one who forged the Military Heart. You're far more suited to be the commander than I am."

Qing Yan's tightly furrowed brow instantly relaxed.

Inside the room, the Qing Clan Ghostman Race cultivators, who had been tense since Qing Chi's admission, began to relax.

A moment later, they were about to unanimously reject the idea.

Ning Zhuo's timely intervention eased the tension.

Jiao Ma's father, however, secretly regretted the turn of events.

Ning Zhuo swept his gaze across the room before fixing it on Jiao Ma's father. "For the military logistics phase, how much can the Jiao Clan contribute?"

Jiao Ma's father's heart skipped a beat. After a moment's hesitation, he named a figure.

Ning Zhuo shook his head. "Not enough."

He immediately quadrupled the figure.

Jiao Ma's father shook his head vehemently. "We can't afford that. Our family simply doesn't have that kind of wealth."

Undeterred, Ning Zhuo pressed his case with logical arguments and relentless bargaining, until Jiao Ma's father, pale-faced and gritting his teeth, finally relented.

The onlookers were stunned. Even Jiao Ma doesn't hold back when it comes to his own father, they thought.

Next, Ning Zhuo turned his attention to Qing Yan.

Even Qing Yan, a Golden Core cultivator, felt his heart skip a beat.

"Our new army is primarily led by the Qing Clan," Ning Zhuo said. "I'm merely the deputy commander. Given the Jiao Clan's substantial contribution, it's only right that the Qing Clan should contribute even more."

Qing Yan's expression turned grave. "The Qing Clan isn't as wealthy as the Jiao Clan..."

He gritted his teeth. "But you're right. Our clan should contribute more!"

In the end, Qing Yan also agreed to provide a significant sum.

However, even with both clans' contributions, the funds were woefully inadequate for the military logistics.

According to Li Xiangshang, the expenses for this phase would far exceed the cost of refining the Military Seeds themselves!

Fortunately, the White Paper City Lord, upon learning that the Military Seed project had been established, immediately allocated substantial funds with a grand wave of her hand. The scale of her support astonished everyone, and they couldn't help but secretly admire her vision and magnanimity.

With the Lord's unwavering backing, the Military Logistics phase finally gained the confidence to proceed. Without it, even ten percent of the initial costs couldn't have been covered by the Qing Clan and Jiao Clan alone.

Ning Zhuo had already suspended his personal cultivation to focus entirely on nurturing the Military Seed. This rare opportunity proved immensely rewarding. In his spare time, he no longer cultivated his Soul but instead immersed himself in Military Manuals, striving to comprehend a viable Military System. He even drastically reduced his physical cultivation.

This wasn't due to laziness on Ning Zhuo's part. He had lent the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat to Li Xiangshang. Despite Li Xiangshang's mediocre talent, his unique aptitude remained invaluable for nurturing the Military Seed. However, Li Xiangshang couldn't sustain this process alone.

After a private discussion with Ning Zhuo, they discovered that activating this aptitude caused Li Xiangshang's body to begin rotting. Medicinal Pills offered minimal relief; his true lifeline lay in the inherent resilience of his physical constitution.

With this in mind, Ning Zhuo thought of the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat. By using this treasure to cultivate his physical body, Li Xiangshang could cleverly borrow the power of heaven and earth, allowing them to nourish him as if he were an infant. This would fundamentally enhance his physical foundation, making it perfectly suited for him.

Li Xiangshang's delight and endless gratitude to Ning Zhuo was a given.

At the same time, Qing Chi, who under Ning Zhuo's guidance, had barely a moment to spare as she devoured the Military Manual.

Firstly, the cultivation of Military Seeds was a matter of survival for both clans, and Qing Chi dared not neglect it. Secondly, studying the manual alongside Ning Zhuo, with whom she could discuss and debate, greatly motivated her.

"Ning Zhuo, I think I've grasped a Military System," Qing Chi suddenly announced one day.

After discussing it with her, Ning Zhuo confirmed that she had indeed comprehended it, rather than merely memorizing it.

This renewed his admiration for Qing Chi's talent.

To be frank, Qing Chi's aptitude was astonishing. Despite her youth, she had already reached the peak of the Foundation Establishment stage.

More crucially, her combat prowess was extraordinary, rivaling that of Golden Core cultivators!

While she lacked skill in artifact refining, her comprehension of military strategy far surpassed Ning Zhuo's own.

Ning Zhuo himself hadn't grasped it, but Qing Chi had already figured it out.

"What kind of military system is it?" Ning Zhuo asked.

"Absolute obedience to orders!" Qing Chi declared triumphantly, pointing to a passage in the Military Manual. "I had an epiphany when I read this."

Ning Zhuo glanced at the passage, which read: "Soldiers who obey their commanders' orders without question shall be rewarded; those who disobey shall be executed!"

He had read this passage before and understood the principle, but he hadn't realized it was the foundation of a military system.

With ample military logistics and a well-defined military system, the cultivation of Military Seeds took a giant leap forward.

The most visible result was a dramatic transformation in the soldiers' morale and discipline. Combined with weapons and armor specially selected by the White Paper City Lord, the new army's outstanding performance in the city defense against the ghost tides completely astonished everyone.

By this point, news of White Paper Immortal City's impending military force could no longer be concealed. The news spread rapidly throughout the city, causing a massive sensation.
