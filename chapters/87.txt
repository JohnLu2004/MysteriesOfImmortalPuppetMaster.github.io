Chapter 87: Discussing Ning Zhuo

“I have heard of such cases. Some people are just exceptionally suited to certain techniques, and their cultivation progresses extremely fast.”

“What's his name? Ning Zhuo? He’s damn lucky to be a perfect match for the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation.”

“Aiya, why couldn't something that good happen to me?”

The vast majority of people had never heard of the name Ning Zhuo.

But now, his name was on everyone's lips.

Inside the training ground, cultivators from the Ning Clan were also asking around.

Being close to the source, many people surrounded Ning Zhuo, introducing themselves to him with smiles on their faces.

It was as if the entire world’s attitude toward Ning Zhuo had changed dramatically in an instant, from cold and indifferent to warm and enthusiastic.

Ning Chen and Ning Yong, who had originally been standing beside Ning Zhuo, were squeezed out.

Ning Yong felt honored and raised his arms, shouting, “Ning Zhuo is my classmate, he's my classmate!”

A young cultivator from the Ning Clan walking by heard this and turned his head with a sneer. “Who isn’t? He’s my classmate too.”

Ning Yong let out a frustrated cry and glared, “But what kind of relationship do you have with him? Can you compare? Ning Zhuo and I are comrades who’ve faced life and death together!”

A Zhou Clan cultivator heard this and approached with a smile. “Little brother, from what you just said, you and Ning Zhuo have a close relationship?”

“Not bad,” Ning Yong nodded immediately, feigning indifference but unable to hide his pride.

The Zhou Clan cultivator quickly cupped his fists and asked Ning Yong for advice.

Ning Yong was about to introduce Ning Zhuo, but Ning Chen gave him a tug, and Ning Yong immediately understood and stopped talking.

Ning Chen took over. “Both of us attended the academy with Ah Zhuo, and we’ve been through life-and-death situations together.

“Ah Zhuo is honest and sincere, friendly and brave. To be friends with him is our good fortune. He is also our role model. I remember back at the academy...” Ning Chen began to speak freely, launching into a glowing account of Ning Zhuo.

The more Ning Chen praised Ning Zhuo in front of these inquisitive outsiders, the more it highlighted the Ning Clan’s foundation.

Besides that, the experience in the Scarlet Flame Monster Volcanic Cavern, as well as the later exposure of the black shadow demonic cultivator and their time hiding in the dungeon, had given them deep respect for Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo and Ning Chen were from the Ning Clan’s branch family just like Ning Zhuo, and thus felt a strong sense of identification with him.

For a time, Ning Zhuo had undoubtedly become the brightest star in the training ground. Because of his stunning display in this single cultivation test, he seemed to have stepped onto a whole new level of life.

The testing continued.

The remaining Ning Clan cultivators entered the testing formation one by one, but their results were mediocre and drew little attention.

It didn’t matter. Just Ning Zhuo alone had already shifted the entire situation!

The joint test by the three clans was both a showcase and evaluation of each clan’s recultivation teams, as well as the basis for negotiating the benefits distribution.

In the world of cultivation, an extraordinary individual could stand above an entire group.

To compare the strength of the three clans, the most important measure was still their top cultivators.

Without Ning Zhuo’s performance, the Ning Clan would only have Ning Xiaohui at the peak of the third level. The Zheng Clan had Zheng Jian. The Zhou Clan had Zhou Zhu, but Zhou Zeshen also had an exceptional innate talent and was a prodigy on par with Zhou Zhu. His original cultivation base was just below Zhou Zhu’s, and in time, he would surely stand shoulder to shoulder with the others.

So in terms of top cultivators, the Zhou Clan had one and a half and would rank first.

The Zheng and Ning Clans each had one prodigy, but the Zheng Clan’s other cultivators had significantly higher cultivation bases than the Ning Clan’s.

With the expansion of the recultivation team, many of the Ning Clan’s cultivators had only a first-level cultivation base, not even worth mentioning.

Therefore, the Zheng Clan should have ranked second, and the Ning Clan third.

But with Ning Zhuo’s appearance, the Ning Clan now had two top cultivators and instantly rose to first place.

The Zhou Clan, with one and a half prodigies, moved to second.

The Zheng Clan was pushed down to third.

After the joint test ended, the Ning Clan patriarch returned to the clan glowing with pride.

Though the distribution of benefits among the three clans still needed further negotiation, thanks to Ning Zhuo’s performance, the Ning Clan completely turned the tables. The outlook for the talks became bright and clear, dispelling the gloom.

The Ning Clan patriarch summoned the junior patriarch with a smile. “Xiaoren, something good happened in the martial arena today. You must have heard by now?”

Ning Xiaoren answered immediately, “Father, I’ve heard. It was I who arranged for Ning Zhuo to join our recultivation team!”

The Ning Clan patriarch nodded. “Gather all the information on Ning Zhuo and compile it. I want to take a look later.”

Ning Xiaoren replied, “I’ve already ordered subordinates to do that.”

The Ning Clan patriarch gave a noise of acknowledgment. “I suspect that Ning Zhuo may possess some kind of innate talent that just hasn’t been detected.”

Ning Xiaoren said, “There are countless types of talents. Even though our clan conducts tests every year, how could we cover everything? Your suspicion makes sense. We can rearrange the testing process and have Ning Zhuo retested.

“But if he does have some kind of rare or strange talent, there’s a high chance it won’t show up in regular testing.”

The Ning Clan patriarch nodded. “If he has a talent, that’s for the best. Even a low-grade talent would make him a prodigy! That way, our Ning Clan’s recultivation team can truly stand on equal footing with the Zhou Clan.”

The Zhou Clan’s Zhou Zeshen and Zhou Zhu both had innate talents.

So do Ning Xiaohui and Zheng Jian.

During the joint test among the three clans, Ning Zhuo’s cultivation base at the peak of the third level only showed everyone that the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation suited him extremely well.

Ning Xiaoren then said, “Father, isn’t it up to us to decide whether he has an innate talent or not?

“Even if the tests don’t detect one and he’s just highly compatible with the Five Elements Qi Regulation Incantation, it doesn’t matter. As long as we assign him one, we can proudly tell the outside world that yes, our clan has two prodigy cultivators!”

The Ning Clan patriarch shook his head. “That won’t do. This isn’t an internal clan matter. It’s not up to us alone.

“If we falsify something, the other two clans will definitely investigate and carry out their own tests. After all, this kind of power comparison directly affects our negotiation over the benefits distribution.

“It wasn’t easy for us to establish a cooperation with the Zhou and Zheng Clans, and this time was mostly thanks to the Lava Immortal Palace. Our relationship with the two clans is much better than it used to be, so we must act with integrity. If we’re discovered to have fabricated something, it will damage our Ning Clan’s bigger picture.”

Ning Xiaoren nodded, indicating that he understood the lesson.

The Ning Clan patriarch sighed. “And if Ning Zhuo really is found to have an innate talent, that’s not ideal either. Xiaoren, you understand what I mean, don’t you?”

Ning Xiaoren nodded again. “I understand, Father. Ning Xiaohui is from our main family, while Ning Zhuo is from the branch family. Their current cultivation base is similar, but Ning Xiaohui has received significant support from our Ning Clan whereas Ning Zhuo has not.

“In the Ning Clan’s recultivation team, the people from the branch family greatly outnumber those coming from the main family.

“On the training ground, as soon as Ning Zhuo revealed his true cultivation base, he was immediately surrounded and enthusiastically welcomed by members of the Ning Clan’s branch family.”

“If we later detect that he also has an innate talent, then we have to worry that Ning Xiaohui won’t be able to suppress him.”

The Ning Clan patriarch showed a satisfied expression. “Since you understand this, I’m no longer worried about how you’ll handle the matter of Ning Zhuo. Go take care of it.”

“Yes, Father. Please rest assured, I will take care of this matter cleanly and beautifully. I take my leave.”

Ning Xiaoren’s feelings toward Ning Zhuo were complicated.

Sixteen years ago, during the Ning Clan’s migration, he had narrowly escaped an ambush by boarding the mechanical carriage of Ning Zhuo’s parents.

In order to ensure the mechanism carriage could break free, Ning Zhuo’s father had stepped down to block the enemy.

That was how Ning Xiaoren survived.

Ning Zhuo’s father was truly his life-saving benefactor. Ning Xiaoren had even sworn on the spot to treat Ning Zhuo and his mother kindly and to fully support Ning Zhuo’s future cultivation.

Ning Xiaoren did not keep that promise.

Ning Zhuo’s mother perished fourteen years ago. During Ning Zhuo’s growing years, Ning Xiaoren barely paid any attention to him.

He originally thought Ning Zhuo was just an ordinary child, but to his surprise, Ning Zhuo had suddenly started to shine, stunning everyone during the three clans’ joint examination.

When he heard the news, his first reaction wasn’t delight. It was discomfort.

He was feeling very awkward.

And there was lingering question in his heart: “Why did it have to be him?!”

As Ning Xiaoren walked along the road toward his residence, he sighed to himself, “If only it weren’t Ning Zhuo. That would be so much better.

“That kid is now sixteen years old. He already has his own thoughts and feelings, and won’t be so easy to influence.”

In the midst of his reflection, Ning Xiaoren recalled something that Ning Ze had once said.

Back when the results of the clan examination were announced, Ning Xiaoren had pressured Ning Ze several times in a bid to extort some money.

At the time, Ning Ze had reported to him that Ning Zhuo had a reclusive personality, had grown independent, and no longer listened to his elders.

Thinking of this, Ning Xiaoren made a decision. “It’s not suitable to approach Ning Zhuo in the short term.

“With his temperament, I can’t win him over with a few words.

“Ning Zhuo knows that his father saved my life, and he also knows that I’ve ignored him for the past sixteen years. All of this needs a proper explanation.

“I’ll have to start with Ning Zhuo’s uncle.”
