Chapter 483: Mulan, Endure for a Moment

“Hmm?” The old demon cultivator’s brows furrowed as he once again observed that Ning Zhuo’s fate had changed.

“The previous increase was only a few threads, a few strands. But this time, it actually rose so much.”

“This brat Ning Zhuo is truly cunning!”

“If I had been fooled by that earlier façade, let my guard down, and carelessly used the Three-Thread Qi-Breaking Curse, wouldn’t I have fallen right into his trap?!”

The old demon cultivator’s back went cold from fright, and he immediately broke out in a cold sweat.

He let out a cold snort, his gaze icy and venomous.

He took out a large amount of precious materials again, but this time, instead of adding them directly, he let them remain suspended in midair for the time being.

The old demon cultivator took a deep breath, bit back his intense pain, and tore away a large part of the fox fur covering his chest.

Ignoring the blood that gushed forth, he raised his arm, tossing the strip of fox fur into the air.

The fox fur burst apart in midair, turning into a cloud of smoke that covered all the hovering precious materials, leaving not a single trace of aura leaking out.

The old demon cultivator gritted his teeth and continued to arrange his materials.

Having obtained the mechanical puppets, Ning Zhuo did not return to the Three Generals Camp. Instead, he secretly left the city, activated the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon to travel through the void, and arrived at an uninhabited mountain valley.

The mechanical ring showed no more signs of activity, which let him feel at ease.

He shook out his various storage bags, releasing all of his mechanical puppets.

In an instant, more than four hundred mechanical puppets crowded the small valley, perched on rocks and in the trees, filling every space.

Ning Zhuo used his divine sense to activate the Buddha Heart Demon Seal in his upper dantian, firing out one pink heart seal after another.

Once each heart seal was planted, Ning Zhuo immediately formed a close bond with these mechanical puppets.

He then tried to use his divine sense to control them. However, after managing to command just over one hundred seventy of them, he could no longer continue.

The number of targets that could be controlled simultaneously by one’s divine sense varied greatly, depending on the cultivator’s methods, inherent abilities, and personal magical treasures.

Ning Zhuo’s cultivation technique, the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique, was itself adept at controlling multiple targets at once—but it required the use of special mechanical mirrors.

The method to make these mirrors was recorded in the Foundation Establishment section of the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique, under the name “Splitting Mind Mirror.”

“Once I’m back at the Three Generals Camp, I’ll forge the Splitting Mind Mirror.”

So thinking, Ning Zhuo spread his ten fingers wide, sending out ten strands of suspended silk from them to control the ten strongest nearby puppets.

In an instant, his connection with these ten mechanical puppets became extremely tight and powerful.

This was the most common method for a mechanical cultivator to control puppets.

It produced the strongest link, but allowed control of the fewest units.

Although cultivators had many methods to split and branch out their threads of magical power to control more targets, doing so would weaken that link.

And Ning Zhuo’s true strongest method of control ultimately was…

A divine ability —“Life Hanging by a Thread!”

But unfortunately, for these more than four hundred mechanical puppets, Life Hanging by a Thread was ineffective.

“Life Hanging by a Thread can be used to control cultivators, as well as intelligent mechanical creations like Yuan Dasheng,” Ning Zhuo said to himself. “So, if I want to use my divine ability on these mechanical puppets, it seems there might be one possible way…”

Ning Zhuo took out the Hidden Spirit Box.

Inside was a wealth of spiritual essences, which Ning Zhuo had begun collecting back in the Lava Immortal Palace, greatly increasing it after burning many relics in Misty Mountain.

The store of spiritual essences was considerable, and quite mixed.

Ning Zhuo opened the Hidden Spirit Box just a little, drawing out bits of spiritual essence and guiding them into the bodies of each mechanical puppet.

The puppets did not move.

Ning Zhuo kept adding more spiritual essence to fill them.

The mixed spiritual essences tangled, collided, and separated within each puppet, never merging into a unified whole. They remained scattered, producing no real effect.

Ning Zhuo attempted to use the Life Hanging by a Thread divine ability, letting a little of it fall on the top of a puppet’s head.

“Success!”

A flash of joy appeared on Ning Zhuo’s face, but it vanished in an instant. He realized that although Life Hanging by a Thread could take effect, the mixed spiritual essences were rapidly being consumed in this state—an alarming speed.

Very soon, all of the large amount of mixed essence he had poured in was used up.

Ning Zhuo’s expression turned slightly grim.

With the essence depleted, his Life Hanging by a Thread withdrew from the mechanical puppet on its own.

He fell into deep thought. “Mixed spiritual essences can help Life Hanging by a Thread seize control of a mechanical puppet in a very short time.”

“During that short time, I can exercise the most absolute control over those puppets!”

“That means the combat power of this mechanical army could potentially spike to its extreme limit.”

But it still had to be used sparingly.

It could only serve as a final trump card.

Used too many times, it would expose the Life Hanging by a Thread divine ability.

Clearly, once this divine ability was exposed, it would create huge problems for Ning Zhuo’s wanderings and dealings with others throughout the world.

“But if the situation becomes too dangerous, then there’ll be no choice.”

The battlefield was perilous!

Anything could happen in war.

Ning Zhuo remembered the ambush well. Faced with the enemy’s sudden counterattack, he had no time to react, even in the midst of protective forces. Ever since then, Ning Zhuo had lost any sense of security.

He now began practicing the “Light-Footed Whirlwind Formation.”

Oh no, it should be called the “Swift Wind Formation.”

Before long, Ning Zhuo’s face turned pale. Fine beads of sweat appeared on his forehead, and his divine sense in his upper dantian was consumed violently.

He was able to practice only thirty percent of the Swift Wind Formation before he could not keep going.

Under normal circumstances, soldiers following the formation’s instructions would move on their own.

But now, every puppet’s movement had to be instructed by Ning Zhuo personally.

This made the difficulty of forming the battle array shoot through the roof.

Unless they could reach the level of intelligence possessed by Yuan Dasheng or Meng Yehu, they would not be able to act autonomously and follow the formation as it was designed.

“Refine a single spiritual essence and let it grow smarter, so it can follow the battle formation’s instructions,” Ning Zhuo thought.

“Forge treasures like the Splitting Mind Mirror.”

“Improve my own puppet-controlling methods!”

“Enhance my personal divine sense in terms of strength and scale, so I can control even more mechanical puppets at once.”

Ning Zhuo’s mind raced, and he soon came up with multiple ideas.

“Combining various methods, I must make my mechanical puppets able to form battle arrays.”

By now, he had some experience in the chaos of battle.

The ambush made him deeply aware that only by forming a proper battle array could one triumph over the strong with lesser strength.

A battle array was a remarkably mature and excellent method, allowing a group of weaker forces to unite their strength nearly perfectly to oppose an even more powerful enemy.

Back in ancient times, when the myriad arts of cultivation were not yet so advanced, array mastery and warfare doctrines had not developed to such a degree. There was no way to leverage numerical advantage. That was why the cultivation world of that era placed greater emphasis on the individual’s progress and realm. Looking over the history of that time, there were countless examples of one person defeating thousands of troops, sweeping away entire immortal cities.

Sun Lingtong suggested, “Little Zhuo, don’t forget that I can help you control part of the puppets too.”

That was indeed a good suggestion.

Sun Lingtong’s divine sense was already quite excellent.

He also had some ability to operate different mechanical devices. After all, he had started studying the mechanical classics left behind by Ning Zhuo’s mother a long time ago.

But after Ning Zhuo had practiced the Swift Wind Formation briefly, he went on to a more important experiment.

Military Tactic —“Return of the Warrior” Technique!

Under the effect of this tactic, Ning Zhuo deliberately destroyed some of his mechanical puppets.

He destroyed them to varying degrees.

In the mildest cases, he only disconnected the puppet from his control, leaving it motionless where it stood.

Next, he dismantled some puppets without damaging their parts. With enough time, they could be reassembled.

He also damaged certain parts of their bodies.

Finally, he completely crushed some puppets, even obliterating them.

After one round of trials, Ning Zhuo’s aura rose sharply, and he arrived at a preliminary conclusion: “Just disassembling them yields no enhancement. The more completely they are destroyed—and the more battle strength they still have right before destruction —the greater the boost for me.”

Sun Lingtong was delighted. “Little Zhuo, in that case, can’t you achieve Nascent Soul-level combat strength?”

Ning Zhuo smiled and shook his head.

Sun Lingtong smacked his own forehead. “Oh, I see. You’re only at the Foundation Establishment stage, so your body and soul are too weak to carry Nascent Soul-level strength!”

After all, between Foundation Establishment and Nascent Soul lay the Golden Core realm.

Previously, Ning Zhuo had only used part of his divine sense in the General Illustration Array to form an illusory figure.

To bring it into reality, there was no way he could receive such a huge power boost. If Nascent Soul-level strength were channeled into his body, he would be instantly killed.

Ning Zhuo added, “Not only am I incapable of bearing it, but there’s also a chance that the Return of the Warrior tactic itself can be broken by the enemy.”

“This tactic, combined with my mechanical puppet army, can elevate my strength to the Golden Core level.”

“But if I use it too often, the enemy will surely target it. It’ll also be fairly simple to counter.”

Sun Lingtong nodded and offered his own suggestion: “To maximize your power, Little Zhuo, I recommend that you command your own separate army!”

Ning Zhuo shook his head. “I’ve thought about that too. If I lead an army independently, getting integrated into another national register, I’ll receive the second nation’s blessing of national power.”

“That way, once my mechanical puppets are sacrificed, I’ll gain more enhancement.”

“In fact, at the start of a war, I could even deliberately sacrifice some mechanical puppets, boosting my personal power so I’d have a better chance of surviving on the battlefield!”

Ning Zhuo’s greatest advantage lay in his mechanical craft.

Because of the ambush, the instructions left behind by Gao Sheng, and so on, he had found a method of battling using a mechanical puppet army.

This method was indeed peculiar, and it hinted at a future worth anticipation.

Ning Zhuo glanced at the mechanical ring, put away all his puppets, and smoothed over the surrounding rocks before once again departing by means of the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon.

Upon returning to the Three Generals Camp, the first thing he did was pay a visit to Liu Er, hoping to get an official roster for his puppet army.

Liu Er smiled bitterly, expressing great difficulty.

“Military Advisor, you know the state of the Three Generals Camp. Our official spots are limited. If we take out a large portion for your puppets, how many would be left for my second brother and third brother and me to command?”

Liu Er, uncharacteristically, refused Ning Zhuo’s request.

He kept a polite smile on the surface, yet inwardly was filled with loathing. That dislike emerged from deep in Liu Er’s heart.

Ning Zhuo nodded. “That’s too bad. In that case, I’ll have to go to the Red Flower Camp for assistance. Please excuse me, General.”

“Huh? Hey?!” Liu Er froze, cursing inwardly, automatically reaching out as though to call Ning Zhuo back.

Had he known that setting up a meeting between Ning Zhuo and Mulan would lead to this, Liu Er certainly would not have turned Ning Zhuo down.

“What am I doing? Sending Ning Zhuo over to the Red Flower Camp? As if his relationship with Mulan wasn’t close enough already?!”

Regret weighed on Liu Er, and he wanted to smack himself in the face.

But he could not think of a proper reason to stop Ning Zhuo, and in the end could only watch as he departed again.

“Are the two of them going to end up dual cultivating?”

“Yet Master recently wrote me, telling me to suspend lending out the Yin-Yang Qi Vase. What is Master really planning?”

When Ning Zhuo arrived at the Red Flower Camp, he found he could enter without any prior announcement.

“Ning Zhuo… my lord.” Mulan, upon hearing of his arrival, immediately put aside her military duties to greet him.

She was a Marshal’s daughter, proud and strong. Even when there were no outsiders around, she had not changed her tone to call Ning Zhuo her husband.

Ning Zhuo cupped his fists in greeting, stating his reason for coming.

Mulan nodded without hesitation, agreeing at once: “The Red Flower Camp has a full capacity of three thousand soldiers, but it’s been understrength for a long time.”

“I have plenty of openings. They can be given to your mechanical puppets.”

“Hold on!” Zhang Zhongyi lifted the tent curtain and barged in.

He hurried over to Ning Zhuo and grabbed him by the arm. “You’re finally here, Young Master Ning Zhuo!”

“Do you know how long I’ve been waiting for you? Look, General Mulan didn’t hesitate at all. She solved your roster issue with a single word.”

“You two are already husband and wife—oughtn’t you show some gratitude?”

Mulan cleared her throat. “Uncle Zhang, please don’t make things difficult for Young Master Ning Zhuo. If anyone owes gratitude, it’s I, for what he did previously in that mechanical shop…”

Zhang Zhongyi cut her off, fixing his gaze on Ning Zhuo. “Then what about General Mulan’s injury? How are you going to handle that?”

Ning Zhuo smiled wryly. “Of course I’ll fix it.”

Zhang Zhongyi immediately jumped in, “No time like the present—right now! Do you know how many times I went to the Three Generals Camp looking for you? Each time, you happened to be out. Odd, isn’t it?!”

Ning Zhuo reached out his hand. “If that’s the case, please let me read the ‘Mysterious Gold Armor-Breaking Art.’”

The Mysterious Gold Armor-Breaking Art!

It was the family art passed down in Grand General Mu’s household—the foundation of old General Mu’s cultivation.

With the jade slip in hand, Ning Zhuo focused his mind on reading, and his brow knitted slightly.

The Mysterious Gold Armor-Breaking Art was a military tactic, not a pure metal-element cultivation method. Though it contained some metal-element principles, its core approach lay in harnessing military force.

“As expected of the Grand General’s family technique —it’s very profound!”

After studying it a short while, Ning Zhuo genuinely felt admiration.

Even in such a short time, he had learned a lot from the tactic portion.

Zhang Zhongyi asked anxiously, “Young Master Ning Zhuo, can you treat her?”

“Certainly,” Ning Zhuo nodded.

His skill in the Five Elements was very deep. Even if he was not versed in military tactics, he could still start with the metal-element aspect and create a treatment plan.

“This method can’t thoroughly cure her, but it can bring significant relief.”

“Now, let me explain in detail to the two of you.”

After imparting his knowledge, Ning Zhuo was still forced to remain in Mulan’s tent to treat her, thanks to Zhang Zhongyi’s insistence.

Midway through the treatment, Zhang Zhongyi’s left hand trembled, causing his needle to slip slightly and making Mulan spit up a mouthful of blood.

“Hurry, push the general’s vital energy and replace her blood!” Zhang Zhongyi hastily called.

Ning Zhuo quickly reacted, moving in front of Mulan, placing his palm over her lower abdomen, massaging gently and channeling his power into her.

Only then did Mulan’s condition stabilize.

Zhang Zhongyi let out a long sigh. “Alas, I’m old. I never thought that my hand would slip at the last moment.”

“Sigh.” He heaved another sigh, took one glance at Ning Zhuo and Mulan, who were so very close, and put a hand to his forehead. “I’ll leave the rest to you two. I feel dizzy and need to rest.”

With that, he brushed aside Ning Zhuo’s efforts to persuade him otherwise and left swiftly, showing no sign of any actual dizziness.

He left Ning Zhuo and Mulan there, looking at each other.

It was the first time Ning Zhuo was in such a posture, in such close proximity to General Mulan.

He raised his head just slightly and saw that this female general had sharply defined features and was full of heroic spirit. Her face, though resolute, now showed a certain softness.

For the sake of treatment, she had removed her armor, wearing only a red undergarment.

Her jet-black hair was tied up casually, with a few strands hanging loose from the band, gently brushing against her forehead and clinging slightly with sweat, revealing both fatigue and bravery.

The tips of her hair fell against the red fabric, black and red offsetting each other in clear contrast.

Mulan sat upright with her back straight, revealing a distinct martial bearing in her upper body.

Ning Zhuo noticed that Mulan’s shoulders were broad, yet her waist was slender—such feminine features had been hidden under her heavy armor before.

Mulan met Ning Zhuo’s gaze briefly. Her breathing became somewhat uneven, her eyelashes trembling. Her eyes no longer held quite the same unwavering determination, as she wanted to shift her gaze away but still refused to retreat, determined to maintain her imposing presence.

Ning Zhuo, however, lowered his head and focused on Mulan’s lower abdomen. “There’s one last spot of blocked energy. I’m going to break through it with all I have. Just endure for a moment.”

Mulan nodded slightly and had barely begun to reply when Ning Zhuo acted without warning.

Taken by surprise, her initial “Mm” turned into a faint moan.

In that moment, two red flushes instantly appeared on Mulan’s cheeks.

Since childhood, she had never been this close to a man, nor made such a sound.

All at once, the atmosphere in the tent became somewhat amorous.
