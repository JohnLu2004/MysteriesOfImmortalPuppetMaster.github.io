Chapter 610: The Choice

What a strange sensation!

Once Qing Chi had fully grasped her military spirit, she was able to access her faction’s military intelligence.

And with that control came knowledge - of three distinct paths to forge her troop type.

“The first, Paper Money Spirit Envoys, requires one hundred thousand jin of century-aged green sandalwood pulp, mixed with cinnabar from Chenzhou to craft spirit coins of a green-purple hue. As the coins are burned, nine hundred jin of sunken agarwood from the South Sea must be burned alongside to temper the divine sea. Finally, endless yin energy must be infused into the body for twenty-seven days straight to complete the process.”

“The second, Yin Sigil Bane Wardens, requires three thousand jin of magnetic thundersteel, paired with multicolored gallstones from Mount Taihang. Then, eight hundred strands of military balefire must be bound to the material, and finally one must enter closed-door cultivation for three days and nights.”

“The third, Ghost Wail Gatebreakers, begins by drawing a Gate-Sealing Formation and gathering over ten thousand ghost spirits. These are arrayed into a Ten Thousand Ghosts Submit array. Then, oil must be refined from three millennium-old corpses to coat the emerging troops. They are cast into a surge of yin energy, where they must devour endless yin until the corpse oil transforms entirely into corpse wax. Only then can they be withdrawn and considered complete.”

When Qing Chi learned the actual costs, she stood frozen in place.

The price was staggering.

As a ghostman girl, she understood very well - selling herself and the entire Qing family still might not raise enough resources to afford any of these.

She reported the details to Qing Yan.

His face visibly paled as he tried to offer comfort. “Don’t panic, girl. We were never going to accomplish this on our own.”

“We’ll ask the City Lord for aid.”

“If we succeed in raising this army, it will bring enormous benefits to White Paper Immortal City. They’ll want to support us.”

“In fact,” Qing Yan added, “given the current state of things, this might be the perfect time.”

He saw the situation clearly.

So Li Xiangshang and Qing Chi submitted a report together - and as expected, it caught the city’s attention.

A projection of the City Lord personally handled the matter. But upon hearing the costs involved, she simply said, “That’s all?”

White Paper Immortal City had attempted to form a military many times in the past.

But time and again, they had failed at the very first hurdle: condensing a military spirit. Without that, everything else was empty talk.

Now, Qing Chi hadn’t just formed a military spirit - she’d advanced all the way to the troop-forging phase.

The City Lord’s projection turned to Li Xiangshang and said with genuine admiration, “Your low-tier innate talent really is useful. It doesn’t just lower the threshold for forming a military spirit - it even reduces the resource cost of raising troops. This has cut at least thirty percent off, hasn’t it?”

Qing Chi turned her head sharply to look at him.

Only now did the naive ghostman girl realize - the costs she’d just seen had already been reduced by a full thirty percent!

Li Xiangshang looked back at her and said calmly, “My talent isn’t the key here. The real reason this succeeded is you, Miss Qing Chi. Not just anyone can condense a military spirit - it takes the sincere support of many.”

The City Lord’s projection nodded slightly, agreeing with his assessment.

She fell silent for a moment, then spoke again. “As for the cost of forging these troops, White Paper Immortal City can shoulder it. However...”

She paused and changed her tone, raising a condition.

It was simple, and very direct: the resulting troop type could be kept in Qing Chi’s care, but from that moment on, it would belong to White Paper Immortal City.

Li Xiangshang looked to Qing Chi. These troops weren’t his, so it wasn’t his place to decide.

Qing Chi hesitated. She didn’t like the idea. After everything she’d gone through to forge this path, why should the result belong to someone else?

The City Lord’s projection saw the hesitation and said coolly, “In the past, we’ve made many attempts to raise an army. Most failed.”

“And forming a military spirit? We’ve actually succeeded at that more than once.”

“But forming a military unit involves many steps, and the process is time-limited. The most regrettable attempt pushed all the way to the final stage - only to fail for lack of time.”

“Compared to the efforts of previous generations in White Paper Immortal City, your attempt this time is far more reckless.”

“Your only advantage lies in Young Friend Li’s innate talent.”

“Can you even supply a tenth of the resources needed to raise this troop? Without resources, failure is inevitable.”

“And even with resources, success isn’t guaranteed. If it fails, White Paper Immortal City alone will have to swallow the staggering loss.”

“Even if you do succeed, to be frank... this new army might not change anything for White Paper Immortal City in the grand scheme.”

Every word from the City Lord was reasoned and precise, leaving Qing Chi speechless.

As for Li Xiangshang - he was a pure ascetic cultivator, awkward with words. At this moment, he could only stand by in silence.

Qing Chi furrowed her brow and said heavily, “City Lord, I can’t make this decision alone. I’d like to go back and discuss it with my father.”

The City Lord nodded with a smile. “Go.”

On one hand, even if the troop’s ownership were agreed upon, Qing Chi would still be needed to lead it for quite some time. On the other, the City Lord had full confidence that Qing Chi would eventually agree.

“Oh, one more thing.”

“If our city is to provide the resources, then the troop type must be set as Ghost Wail Gatebreakers.”

So not only would the troop be claimed by White Paper Immortal City, even the type had to be decided in advance.

Qing Chi kept her head down on the way back, silent all the while.

The weight of that silence became too much for Li Xiangshang, who finally spoke to comfort her.

Qing Chi said, “Yeah, handing the troop over to someone else does feel pretty awful - but I trust the White Paper City Lord won’t treat us unfairly.”

“But what I just heard... even if we pass this troop-forging stage, there are still many hurdles ahead. In the end, we might still fail to raise an army.”

“If that happens, do you think I could still use this condition... to take Jiao Ma back?”

Li Xiangshang: …

He hadn’t expected that to be what was weighing on her.

But thinking it over, it actually made perfect sense.

The demon cultivator sighed deeply. “Then let me give you another piece of bad news. Ever since we started raising this army, I’ve been sustaining my innate gift continuously. But I won’t be able to keep it up much longer - at most, I’ve got half a month left before I have to stop.”

“And once I do, failure is almost certain.”

Qing Chi was shocked. “Ah? How can that be?”

“I told you before,” Li Xiangshang said, spreading his hands with a faintly guilty look, “this is just a temporary army we’re building. Fortunately, even if we don’t finish, this temporary force can still execute battle formations - it just won’t be nearly as effective as a true formal army.”

But Qing Chi shook her head. “That’s not what I meant. I want to know - just how much have you sacrificed to maintain your innate gift? If the price is too high, we should stop right now.”

“It’s true I want to win Jiao Ma back. That’s from the bottom of my heart - it’s my personal desire.”

“But I don’t want to see my friends or family suffer or be harmed because of my selfishness.”

Li Xiangshang burst out laughing. “You silly girl.”

A warm current surged through his chest.

He offered sincere advice. “My gift can only last for a short while - that’s something the City Lord doesn’t know. So I’d advise you: take the win while you can. Let White Paper Immortal City take the reins.”

“Use this chance to be honest with the City Lord. Do your best to get her to release that brat from the Jiao clan first.”

Qing Chi shook her head, voice uncertain. “Can I even bring it up? I don’t really dare. Wouldn’t that be like stealing the City Lord’s man? Jiao Ma’s so outstanding - I doubt she’d let him go easily!”

Li Xiangshang: …

After thinking for a moment, he said, “This kind of request - you should bring it up boldly.”

“We already reported the matter of morale. By now, the City Lord has definitely looked into you.”

“She must know you and Jiao Ma are close - and that you’ve pledged yourselves to each other.”

“Right now, during the troop negotiations, you’ve got a prime opportunity. If you ask, I think there’s a good chance she’ll agree.”

Qing Chi’s eyes lit up. “Really?”

But then she shook her head again. “It’s a big deal. I’m worried that if I take Jiao Ma away, the City Lord might retaliate against my clan. I’d better talk to my father first.”

As they talked, the two used spiritual sense to keep their voices hidden. But when they returned to their temporary lodgings in the city, they were told that Jiao Ma was already inside, paying a visit.

Qing Chi instantly brightened, all her worries thrown aside. She hurried forward and stepped through the door. “What? Little Ma came on his own? Where is he - take me to him!”

But Li Xiangshang’s expression darkened. “That’s not good.”

He reached out and stopped her. Qing Chi turned back, confused.

Li Xiangshang sighed. “The City Lord’s tactics really are sharp.”

“She knows how much that Jiao brat affects you, so she sent him to talk you into agreeing to the deal.”

Qing Chi asked, “Is that really it?”

Li Xiangshang nodded firmly. “Very likely!”

A moment later - 

Jiao Ma (Ning Zhuo) shook his head. “I came purely out of my own selfish reasons.”

Qing Chi’s face immediately lit up. “Little Ma, you came just to see me!”

Ning Zhuo nodded. “I did.”

“You’re trying to raise a military unit, but that comes at a steep cost.”

“If you’re seeking White Paper Immortal City’s support, you may well end up at their mercy.”

“Tell me what you need. Maybe I can help.”

Qing Chi shook her head with a sigh. “Little Ma, you don’t know how horrifying the cost of troop cultivation really is - it’s enough to scare someone senseless.”

She laid it all out: the full cost, and the terms the City Lord had offered.

Qing Yan nodded. He didn’t look especially surprised.

“Raising a troop is beyond what we can do on our own.”

“Handing it over to White Paper Immortal City is basically inevitable. If I were the City Lord, I’d demand the same.”

“After all, we’re just ghostmen - not even human, and definitely not among her trusted followers.”

“If we ended up commanding our own army, then down the line, the Ghostly Black Marshlands would have a second voice.”

Li Xiangshang’s eyes widened in realization. “So that’s what it means.”

He was just a reclusive cultivator, not a fool - and this journey had opened his eyes many times.

“A second voice? What do you mean?” Qing Chi looked puzzled.

Qing Yan gave a brief explanation, and Qing Chi quickly waved her hands. “But we’re citizens of White Paper Immortal City! Our village only survives thanks to the city’s protection - we’d never go against the City Lord!”

“You never know,” Li Xiangshang thought to himself. Almost reflexively, his eyes drifted to Jiao Ma (Ning Zhuo), who sat quietly to the side.

Qing Yan frowned slightly and gritted his teeth. “Handing the military unit over to White Paper Immortal City - we can accept that. But the troop type they’ve chosen isn’t right. We’d be better off with the Yin Sigil Bane Wardens.”

Qing Chi gave a surprised “Ah?” To her, any of the three troop types seemed fine - she hadn’t expected Qing Yan to fixate on what felt like a minor detail.

With a sigh, Qing Yan explained to his daughter, “The Ghost Wail Gatebreakers work by embedding arrays into the soldiers’ bodies to seal all kinds of ghost creatures within them. It’s like locking them in solitary confinement.”

“On one hand, this can be used in battle to temporarily imprison troublesome ghost entities. On the other, soldiers can use formations and training techniques to tame the ghosts and form spirit contracts.”

“If we choose this type, White Paper Immortal City could end up with double or even triple the troop numbers.”

“Over the years, the city has accumulated far too many captive ghost creatures.”

“But raising those ghosts takes immense resources. Maintaining a force of Ghost Wail Gatebreakers costs dozens of times more than the other two options!”

“That would leave us even more at their mercy.”

“And there’s one more thing.”

“Sealing a ghost into your own body - it’s an awful feeling. Sure, we ghostmen carry thick yin energy and are better suited than human cultivators for this kind of task.”

“But a ghost is still a foreign entity. Cultivating with one constantly beside you is difficult and painful. Our ghostman elders would suffer greatly.”

Hearing this, Qing Chi decisively shook her head. “Then we won’t choose that path.”

Her expression turned firm.

The cultivators around her were all kin of the Qing Clan - some were uncles, others cousins. They had supported Qing Chi and helped rally the foundation of the army’s morale.

As a ghostman girl, the last thing she wanted was to see her elders suffer.

Li Xiangshang said, “If we’re not picking the Ghost Wail Gatebreakers, that leaves the other two.”

Qing Yan nodded. “We’ll choose the Yin Sigil Bane Wardens.”

“We already have Burden-Bearing Tactics. Going this route will save us resources in the long run. We can sustain the army through war itself - it has the lowest upkeep.”

“Each soldier will carry suppressive energy, making them highly effective against ghosts.”

“Even if the army fails to come together in the end, the suppressive force will still remain. That, at least, is something we can give to our kin.”

“On top of that, this choice takes the least time - just three days and nights of cultivation.”

Qing Chi nodded. “Alright, then we’ll go with that.”

“Ahem, ahem, ahem.” Ning Zhuo gave three deliberate coughs, then cut in. “No. We should pick the Paper Money Spirit Envoys.”

Qing Chi looked at him. “Little Ma, do you have a reason?”

Ning Zhuo turned to Qing Yan. “I was about to explain earlier, but got interrupted. I’ve come to help fund the creation of our new army.”

“One of my conditions is that we must choose the Paper Money Spirit Envoys.”

Li Xiangshang frowned. “But that unit takes the longest - twenty-seven days. It uses the most resources, and its combat power is the weakest of the three. The only notable trait is that it allows all troops to move freely between the realms of yin and yang - it’s more versatile, sure, but...”

Qing Yan also scowled deeply, staring at Ning Zhuo. “Our enemy is Forgetful River Prefecture Lord Meng. Are we really forming a unit like this to march into the underworld and assault the enemy’s home territory?”

“That’s suicide!”

Ning Zhuo opened his mouth to explain.

Qing Chi cut in first. “Alright, Little Ma - I’ll go with your choice!”

Everyone: ...
