Chapter 169: Peak of the Sixth Layer of Qi Sea

Ning Family's Ancestral Land.

Ning Xiangguo, Ning Xiangqian, and others gathered at Ning Houjun's residence.

They reported Ning Zhuo's actions to Ning Houjun.

"I thought this time, meddling in the black market would definitely lead to a battle. Unexpectedly, the most intense action was just breaking down the Monkey Head Gang's gate." "Looking back, the entire operation was within Ning Zhuo's plan." "Is he really only sixteen years old? Quite remarkable!"

"Don't treat him as an ordinary school graduate. Don't forget, he is someone with innate talent."

"Even with innate talent, compared to Ning Xiaohui and Ning Qingqiao, Ning Zhuo is exceptional. You all should understand what I mean." "Perhaps... it has something to do with his talent? His talent is related to his intellect, so his mind is very agile." "According to the reformation team, after Ning Zhuo's soul entered the Immortal Palace, his puppet body had an exceptionally large head." "In reality, I also think his head is quite big."

Ning Houjun chuckled and waved his hand, "Alright, alright. Ning Zhuo took control of the black market overnight, and the operation was very successful! What are your plans for the future?"

The room fell silent.

Then, Ning Xiangguo said, "Ning Zhuo recruited us, offering a high salary. In the future, we will hide our identities and serve as patrol and law enforcement in the black market." "Until the main branch rehires us, what else can we do?" Ning Houjun nodded, "In that case, do your job well." "Everyone can see Ning Zhuo's prospects after this incident."

"His biggest flaw is his youth, with a cultivation level of only the third layer of Qi Refining Stage. But this is also his greatest advantage." "He's only sixteen years old..."

Ning Houjun's sigh resonated with many Foundation Establishment cultivators.

After Ning Xiangguo, Ning Xiangqian, and others left, Ning Houjun went to the backyard and met Ning Youfu.

The two former elders sat in the pavilion in the backyard, continuing the chess game interrupted by the previous visitors.

While playing, they discussed Ning Zhuo.

"I still underestimated this Ning Zhuo; his abilities are beyond my imagination," Ning Houjun sighed.

"Indeed, our branch hasn't had such an outstanding junior for a long time!" Ning Youfu agreed wholeheartedly.

Ning Houjun stared at the chessboard, "Even the main branch rarely has talents like Ning Zhuo."

Ning Youfu looked at Ning Houjun meaningfully, "This young man knows too much about the black market; there must be someone advising him."

Ning Houjun was surprised, "Isn't it you?"

Ning Youfu pointed at Ning Houjun and laughed, "You preemptively strike and accuse me instead." Ning Houjun shook his head, "Stop joking."

Ning Youfu also shook his head, "You're the one joking with me."

The two glared at each other.

After a few breaths, Ning Houjun frowned, "Whether or not you advised him, the current situation is indeed good. At least our branch has some place to survive." "Yes," Ning Youfu smiled, "Now it's the main branch's turn to be troubled."

The Ning Family Patriarch looked at the intelligence in his hand, reading it twice, still finding it hard to believe, "Is this information accurate?" "Did Ning Zhuo lead our Ning Family's Foundation Establishment cultivators to pacify the black market?"

The subordinate confirmed and made some corrections, "Patriarch, our Ning Family did not officially take action. The real fighters were the Monkey Head Gang, and they suffered heavy casualties." The Ning Family Patriarch's face turned gloomy.

Just the day before yesterday, the main branch had dismissed several branch elders and heavily rewarded Ning Zhuo.

But within a day and a night, the situation had completely changed!

"Ning Zhuo took control of the black market, gaining a basic foothold to support many subordinates." "He actually achieved this!"

"Is someone advising him?" What is momentum?

This is momentum.

Ning Zhuo decisively struck, using thunderous means to break through the predicament, creating a favorable situation for himself.

He officially had a force of his own.

"This has become quite troublesome! If we continue to dismiss elders, it will only send talent to Ning Zhuo." The Ning Family Patriarch felt a bit suffocated.

This was originally a means to coerce the branch, but Ning Zhuo broke the stalemate.

Ultimately, it was Ning Zhuo who discovered the opportunity in the black market and seized it!

Did the Ning Family Patriarch not notice?

Not exactly.

The black market was a power buffer zone for the four major forces.

After Sun Lingtong was wanted, the Ning Family Patriarch closely monitored it.

But such matters, if handled by other Ning Family members, would not work.

Only Ning Zhuo could achieve this.

"Will the Zhou Family and Zheng Family take action?" "Will the City Lord's Mansion expel Ning Zhuo?"

"He meddled in the black market, breaking the tacit understanding of the four forces!"

The Ning Family Patriarch awaited others to take action.

.....

Zhou Family.

"This Ning Zhuo is quite interesting," the Zhou Family Patriarch smiled slightly, "Go and summon Zhou Zesheng." When Zhou Zesheng met the Zhou Family Patriarch, the latter handed him the relevant intelligence.

"Ning Zhuo?!"

"He actually accomplished such a feat... Impressive!"

Zhou Zesheng exclaimed in admiration.

The Zhou Family Patriarch said, "The conflict between Ning Zhuo and the Ning Family main branch is irreconcilable. Not long ago, he just pulled down the Ning Family's young patriarch, and now he controls the black market." "At this rate, the Ning Family might have a second internal war."

Back then, the Ning Family branch attempted to overthrow the main branch, causing an internal battle that alarmed both the Zhou and Zheng Families.

Zhou Zesheng nodded, "I greatly underestimated this person."

"He could intervene in the black market overnight. Even if someone advised him, he is no ordinary person." The Zhou Family Patriarch said, "However, he is still too young." "What is your relationship with him?"

Zhou Zesheng said, "Our relationship can be better!"

"Hahaha," the Zhou Family Patriarch laughed, "In the future, pay attention to drawing Ning Zhuo closer. Last time, Zheng Jian collaborated with him to refine mechanical apes, even using Golden Core Stage materials." "We also have such resources." "I give you this authority, build a good relationship with Ning Zhuo."

"Yes, I will do my best to live up to your expectations, Patriarch!" Zhou Zesheng withdrew.

......

Ning Ze's Residence.

Ning Ze held the intelligence from the night market and showed it to Wang Lan.

"See? I was right!"

"Little Zhuo is extraordinary; he became the master of the black market overnight." Wang Lan's mouth gaped open, unable to close for a long time.

After a while, she accepted the fact, feeling quite complicated, "You always see things more accurately than I do." "But did Little Zhuo really accomplish this?"

Ning Ze nodded slightly, "Even if someone advised him, he still became the master of the black market." "Have Ning Ji follow Little Zhuo and find some work in the black market."

"They are cousins; this bond should be deepened. When we grow old, Little Zhuo will be Ji'er's greatest support." "He's only sixteen now."

"It's hard to imagine what great achievements he will have in the future." "Based on his talent alone, he will at least become an elder." "In fact, look!"

"He now controls the black market, has real power, and is no different from an elder."

Ning Zhuo continued his cultivation.

He took out the Ice Jade Wine.

The Ice Jade Wine had a translucent ice-blue color, sparkling like morning frost under the sunlight.

Ning Zhuo gently swirled the wine glass.

In the jade-carved wine glass, the wine looked like liquid sapphire, with a faint silver halo around it, giving a refreshing feeling at first sight.

The wine had a unique aroma, fresh and elegant, with a distinct icy scent.

Ning Zhuo brought it to his nose, savoring the smell.

Instantly, he felt as if he were in the northern snowfields.

Then, he sensed a faint floral and herbal fragrance amidst the cold, feeling quite refreshed.

Ning Zhuo took a sip.

First, he felt an extreme coolness, like an icy spring sliding over his tongue.

This cool sensation quickly spread throughout his body with the flow of the wine, dispelling all heat and fatigue.

The wine was smooth and gentle, melting in the mouth like snow, leaving a trace of sweetness.

The Ice Jade Wine had a full-bodied texture, rich flavor, without any spiciness, but with a hint of sweetness and a refreshing aftertaste.

Ning Zhuo couldn't help but close his eyes, immersing himself in the experience.

After a long while.

He opened his eyes and praised, "Good wine!"

The wine's effects gradually began to manifest.

Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged on the mat and started his breathing exercises.

Unlike previous cultivation sessions, this time, a grand light emanated from his Divine Sea upper dantian, cascading down like a waterfall, directly into his middle dantian Qi Sea.

In the Qi Sea, clouds surged, and waves rolled, with the Five Elements power rapidly increasing.

The Ice Jade Wine allowed Ning Zhuo to use his Divine Sea cultivation to enhance his Qi Sea cultivation.

In just the time it took for an incense stick to burn, the wine's effects were exhausted.

Ning Zhuo's Qi Sea cultivation experienced a terrifying surge, directly reaching the peak of the sixth layer, on par with his Divine Sea cultivation!

"No wonder it's called Ice Jade Wine!"

"The Ice Heart Jade Flask is indeed our Ning Family's treasured heirloom."

With this, Ning Zhuo, with his peak sixth-layer cultivation, could now open the second Dao Gate.

Ning Zhuo didn't have high expectations for this.

Based on his understanding of the Lava Immortal Palace, the difficulty of the second Dao Gate should be similar to the second Buddha Gate.

"Last time, I took the Buddha Gate route. Although I failed, I gauged the difficulty of the checkpoints."

"To pass the Buddha Gate, I need to collect more rewards from the first Buddha Gate and increase my strength for a better chance of success." "The Dao Gate is likely set up similarly." "Unless there's a coffin room like the first Buddha Gate." Ning Zhuo pondered.

The possibility of encountering a coffin room was small, but Ning Zhuo still needed to push the door to verify.

What if?

Through his relentless efforts, Ning Zhuo's status had significantly improved!

He no longer needed to wait for Ning Xiaohui or others to invite him to form a team.

He could now organize his own team and explore the Lava Immortal Palace.
