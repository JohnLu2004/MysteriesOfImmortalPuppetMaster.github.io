Chapter 168: A Single Thread of Blooming Flowers

Ning Zhuo asked, "What are your names?"

The leader of the Monkey Head Gang was about to answer when Ning Zhuo waved his hand.

The latter said, "Forget it, there's no need for such trouble. I'll give each of you a code name. Even if you die, your successors will still use these names. You, you'll be called Monkey Head." Ning Zhuo pointed at the leader of the Monkey Head Gang, his gaze carrying a condescending weight.

The leader of the Monkey Head Gang gritted his teeth, forcing a smile to express his joy, "Yes! Thank you, my lord, for bestowing the code name." Ning Zhuo then pointed at the leader of the Crane Beak Gang, "From now on, you'll be called Crane Head."

The leader of the Crane Beak Gang opened his mouth, wanting to say, "I came here to negotiate with you. Our Crane Beak Gang hasn't surrendered yet. Only if the conditions are right will we surrender!"

But in such a situation, he could only shout in his heart, unable to speak out.

After a few breaths of silence, the leader of the Crane Beak Gang lowered his head and cupped his hands in response, "Yes." Ning Zhuo then looked at the leader of the Turtle Breath Gang, "As for you, you'll be called Turtle..."

The leader of the Turtle Breath Gang's face changed!

"Turtle Shell." He interrupted Ning Zhuo before he could finish, "My lord, my childhood name is Turtle Shell. If you call me that, I feel like I've found my home and seen my ancestors. You have every right to call me that!"

"Hmm..." Ning Zhuo pondered silently.

The leader of the Turtle Breath Gang's heartbeat quickened slightly, and he hurriedly said, "Lord Ning Zhuo, we have a lot of evidence of smuggling and selling prohibited captives on Feng Heizi. Please allow me to personally go and make Feng Heizi submit."

"Since that's the case," Ning Zhuo waved his hand, "you may go. If you fail to bring Feng Heizi to justice, you'll be held accountable."

"Yes, my lord." The leader of the Turtle Breath Gang turned and left quickly, his steps no longer as composed as before, giving a sense of urgency.

Ning Zhuo then looked at the leader of the Crane Beak Gang, "The Unclean's medicinal herbs are almost all purchased from your gang. Can you invite him, given this relationship?"

The leader of the Crane Beak Gang felt a chill in his heart.

How did Ning Zhuo know about this secret business transaction?

He quickly nodded, "I will do my best." Ning Zhuo then looked at the leader of the Monkey Head Gang.

The latter immediately said, "Monkey Head is here, awaiting your orders, my lord!"

Ning Zhuo: "You go find the One-Armed Craftsman. He has a fiery temper and loves to craft self-exploding magical artifacts. He lost his arm in one of his own explosions. Talk to him nicely, do not use force. He hates being threatened. Remember to speak gently!"

"No matter what method you use, make him acknowledge my control over the black market and reopen it. Without his self-exploding magical artifacts, the black market loses a major attraction."

The leader of the Monkey Head Gang cupped his fists, "I understand!"

Ning Zhuo issued three orders in quick succession, then once again summoned the Floating Cloud, enveloping himself and silently began cultivating.

"He really doesn't waste a single moment!"

The Ning family cultivators transmitted their thoughts secretly, filled with admiration.

From the start of the operation, Ning Zhuo had repeatedly refreshed their understanding.

Especially tonight's performance, making the Ning family members feel that Ning Zhuo was confident, commanding, and strategic, capable of controlling the overall situation.

Time gradually passed.

The three gang leaders successively brought good news.

The leader of the Crane Beak Gang was the first to succeed. "The Unclean" was an alchemist by nature, lazy and unwilling to be disturbed.

The change in black market control didn't matter to him; he continued to sell his pills.

The leader of the Turtle Breath Gang was the second to succeed.

His results were much greater than the leader of the Crane Beak Gang's.

Under his coercion and inducement, Feng Heizi had no choice but to sign a contract, fully joining in.

The last was the leader of the Monkey Head Gang.

He returned with a battered face, carrying injuries.

Persuading the One-Armed Craftsman was quite a struggle.

The craftsman had sensed the chaos in Fire Persimmon Immortal City and was planning to move to another city, with his belongings almost packed.

The leader of the Monkey Head Gang tried everything, even offering his private assets as compensation, but to no avail.

In the end, he took a risk and provoked the craftsman into a fight.

The craftsman won, but the leader of the Monkey Head Gang's use of the Mechanical Explosive Monkey greatly impressed him.

This Mechanical Monkey could self-destruct with considerable power, something the craftsman had long known.

What he didn't know was that the creator of the Mechanical Explosive Monkey was Ning Zhuo.

Upon learning that Ning Zhuo controlled the black market, the craftsman's goodwill increased, and he decided to stay.

As the morning light shone upon the city, the black market welcomed a new day.

The Viper Gang's destruction.

The joint announcement by the Monkey Head Gang, Crane Beak Gang, and Turtle Breath Gang.

And the simultaneous reopening announcements by Feng Heizi, the One-Armed Craftsman, and The Unclean.

All these events stirred the hearts of the people, filling them with curiosity and suspicion, "How did the black market undergo such a drastic change overnight?" "What happened last night?!"

"It's said that a noble young master from the Ning family stepped in, initially to avenge his friend Yuan Er, forcing the Monkey Head Gang to submit, and then conveniently took control of the black market." For a time, the city's residents were abuzz with discussions and rumors.

City Lord's Mansion.

Fei Si began handling official duties.

Since the recruitment order was issued, Fire Persimmon Immortal City had been flooded with outside cultivators.

The top of Fire Persimmon Mountain was no longer a restricted area, and under Fei Si's arrangements, it had regained the prosperity it had before the Immortal Palace emerged.

The city guards' presence was merely for show, as various cultivators flocked to the Lava Immortal Palace to try their luck.

Most people's mechanical skills were not up to par and could only look on in vain.

However, a few met the standards and entered the Immortal Palace to explore, becoming the envy of many.

Business in Fire Persimmon Immortal City boomed, but public order deteriorated rapidly, with increasing incidents of lawlessness, adding to Fei Si's burdens.

The drastic changes in the black market had a significant impact on the city's dynamics.

The report on this matter was placed third on Fei Si's list, urgently needing his attention.

After reading the report, Fei Si showed a look of surprise and delight, "Good lad, to accomplish such a feat overnight!" For Ning Zhuo to intervene in the black market, the first obstacle wasn't the three gangs but the City Lord's Mansion.

Sun Lingtong's control over the black market was due to his relationship with Fei Si, who had allowed it in exchange for benefits.

Ning Zhuo had written a secret letter in advance, which was delivered to Fei Si through Chen Cha.

Upon seeing the secret letter, Fei Si's mind conjured an image of Ning Zhuo's ambitious eyes.

"Just like me!"

"Just like I was when I was young."

Ning Zhuo's impressive performance with the Mechanical Monkey and later with Yuan Dasheng had left a deep impression on Fei Si.

He held Ning Zhuo in high regard.

"I was once unappreciated too."

"I also climbed up step by step through research and constant risk-taking. Yesterday's Fei Si is today's Ning Zhuo." "Such an outstanding young man, why not give him a helping hand?"

After Ning Zhuo returned to the family, Fei Si, despite his busy schedule, never stopped secretly paying attention.

He saw Ning Zhuo's rising status within the family and often felt a genuine sense of joy.

In his view, no one understood Ning Zhuo's character better than he did!

He hoped Ning Zhuo would climb higher and higher.

Because the higher Ning Zhuo climbed, the more it validated his own life philosophy and success.

The more valuable Ning Zhuo became, the more Fei Si could benefit from their relationship!

"Climb."

"Climb higher, even higher."

"In the future, when the Meng family controls Fire Persimmon Immortal City, you will control the Ning family. Wouldn't that be wonderful?" Ning Zhuo's talent made Fei Si believe he had great potential for development and was worth investing in.

So, when Ning Zhuo sought Fei Si's permission to unify the black market, Fei Si agreed without much thought.

"I just didn't expect you to accomplish it overnight. Very interesting, very impressive."

"Using the Ning family's Qi Refining Stage cultivators to open the situation, greatly intimidating all parties. And throughout the process, you didn't make a move yourself, leaving no evidence behind."

"Forcing the Monkey Head Gang to take the lead, causing great turmoil in the black market. The Monkey Head Gang suffered heavy casualties and became obedient pawns."

"Precisely capturing key forces and individuals, firmly controlling critical points, achieving twice the result with half the effort!" While Fei Si was silently praising, Chen Cha came to see him.

Chen Cha brought Ning Zhuo's secret letter.

Fei Si opened the letter and saw that Ning Zhuo generously offered fifty percent of the profits to Fei Si.

Such a considerate gesture made Fei Si laugh heartily.

It was the first time he had laughed so openly in days.

"Fifty percent is too high, thirty percent will do. As for the black market, you can control it for a while. Manage it well, don't cause trouble for me!"

"When the time comes, you must let go. Before that, prepare as much as you can." Fei Si sent back a secret letter, carefully storing Ning Zhuo's letter.

These were evidence, crucial for controlling Ning Zhuo in the future.

Just as the leader of the Monkey Head Gang collected evidence to hand over to Ning Zhuo, Ning Zhuo also left evidence to gain Fei Si's trust.

Fei Si's secret letter reached Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo remained expressionless, his heart calm.

He had long anticipated Fei Si's attitude and thoughts.

"Fire Persimmon Immortal City has four major forces: the City Lord's Mansion, the Zhou family, the Zheng family, and the Ning family. They cooperate and compete, maintaining a certain balance."

"The black market is one of the buffer zones under the power struggle of the four major forces. It can be controlled by Sun Lingtong but not by any of the four major forces, even behind the scenes with a proxy."

"The reason I could rise is due to this special timing."

"On one hand, the recruitment order has brought in many outside cultivators, and a stable black market benefits the entire Immortal City and the four major forces. Sun Lingtong's sudden incident left the four forces unprepared to find a suitable person to control the black market."

"On the other hand, although I am from the Ning family, I am from a branch with irreconcilable conflicts with the main branch! Fei Si is happy to see me succeed, and the Zhou and Zheng families hope for internal strife within the Ning family, so they will support me in establishing a new faction. Therefore, when I intervened in the black market, they all thought it was a good idea."

"Once the situation changes, and outsiders no longer flood in, Fire Persimmon Immortal City returns to its usual state, their need for the black market will diminish."

"If I control the black market for too long or show signs of aligning with the Ning family's main branch, causing concern among the other three forces, they will quickly react and drive me out of the black market." Ning Zhuo had long understood that control over the black market was temporary.

"It doesn't matter!"

"My goal is the Lava Immortal Palace."

"Once I seize the Immortal Palace and become its master, what does the black market matter?" "At this critical moment, I need to showcase myself, rally the Ning family branch, and undermine the main branch's schemes."

"The black market is just right!"

"Hehehe." Ning Zhuo smiled.

At this moment, he felt a sense of overseeing the entire situation, strategizing with ease.

"This is the feeling, the feeling of control..."

"Ah, so wonderful!"

For a moment, Ning Zhuo was deeply immersed in this beautiful sensation, unable to extricate himself.

At the same time.

In his upper Dantian Sea of Consciousness, the bud of the Life Hanging by a Thread Divine Ability prototype gently trembled, and a thread extended outward from the bud.

The change in the divine ability prototype immediately caught Ning Zhuo's attention.

A sense of joy filled his heart.

"Excellent!"

"I can feel that the next change in the divine ability prototype will be a qualitative transformation, and it will fully bloom."

"At that time, I will truly master a divine ability—the Life Hanging by a Thread!"
