Chapter 581: Spilled Waters (Happy Birthday to Ning Zhuo!)

Jin Yangzi flicked his sleeve and turned away proudly.

Only after he left the central courtyard did the male consorts break into heated whispers.

“This Jin Yangzi fellow is truly insufferable!”

“Hmph, he’s nothing more than a demonic cultivator, naturally uncivilized. It’s beneath us to stoop to his level.”

“Alas, we humans must endure humiliation at the hands of this demon, how utterly embarrassing!”

“It’s hardly our fault, is it? He’s a true disciple of the Seven Feathers Alliance, rumored to possess remnants of the Three-legged Golden Crow bloodline. His presence here at the Ghostly Black Marshlands is supposedly the fulfillment of a favor between the White-Headed Dragon Lord and the Seven Feathers Alliance. How could ordinary people like us contend with such an individual?”

“Hidden Yang Manor indulges him excessively. When we wish to leave, we must report thrice, yet he merely informs the gatekeepers and strolls right out!”

Listening to their discussions, Sun Lingtong’s curiosity was piqued.

The Seven Feathers Alliance was a superpower comparable to the Soul Devouring Sect and the Void Sect, but primarily composed of demonic cultivators. At its inception, it was formed by seven ancient spirit birds.

The White-Headed Dragon Lord was notably a renowned Soul Formation cultivator within the Flying Cloud Country.

Sun Lingtong glanced again at the bulletin, realizing it listed rankings based on Yang energy contributions among the male consorts of the Hidden Yang Manor. Only the top fifty were displayed; naturally, Jiao Ma (Ning Zhuo) wasn’t mentioned.

“So, Jin Yangzi occupies the top of these rankings persistently, not just due to his formidable strength but also thanks to his influential backing. Above all, his bloodline grants him extraordinary potential!”

“No wonder he’s so arrogant - no one dares provoke him.”

Sun Lingtong departed the central courtyard, approaching the manor’s gates just in time to glimpse Jin Yangzi’s retreating figure.

“He’s heading out again?” Sun Lingtong’s thoughts stirred.

“With the treasures Jin Yangzi carries, if I managed to rob him, the gains would be tremendous!”

Sun Lingtong licked his lips, his usual thieving instincts flaring up again.

“Jin Yangzi is a true disciple of the Seven Feathers Alliance. True disciples from such superpowers are at least Golden Core stage cultivators, with some even at the Nascent Soul stage.”

“But Jin Yangzi must only be at Golden Core!”

Sun Lingtong was very certain of his conclusion.

With all the internal and external threats faced by White Paper Immortal City, it was impossible for them to tolerate the presence of Nascent Soul stage experts from other powers.

If Jin Yangzi truly was at Nascent Soul, he certainly wouldn’t be staying within Hidden Yang Manor.

“I can rob this fellow!” Having come from the Void Sect himself, Sun Lingtong was unfazed by Jin Yangzi’s prestigious background - instead, it excited him further.

Having acquired the Evil Void God’s Bone marrow in the Thousand Peak Forest, Sun Lingtong’s thieving techniques had greatly advanced, bolstering his confidence.

Thinking thus, he discreetly trailed Jin Yangzi, using his stealth techniques to gather traces of his aura.

At a fork in the road, Sun Lingtong parted ways from Jin Yangzi.

He didn’t immediately act.

Firstly, he needed to carefully observe and gather more information. Secondly, he had urgent matters to attend to; otherwise, he’d have trouble explaining himself to Ning Zhuo later.

Still unfamiliar with White Paper Immortal City, Sun Lingtong wandered a bit before finding a trustworthy route - someone secretly dealing in confidential intelligence.

As he followed this path into a narrow alley, he suddenly sensed Jin Yangzi’s aura.

“He’s nearby?”

Since it was along his route anyway, Sun Lingtong decisively concealed himself and approached silently.

In the alleyway, Jin Yangzi halted, hands clasped behind him, suddenly turning with a sneer, “Come out, sneaky rat! You’ve followed me this far - show yourself!”

Sun Lingtong tensed, ready to employ his escape techniques, but Jin Yangzi glanced briefly in his direction, “Not you, short stuff.”

“Hehehe.” A chilling laugh echoed as a mysterious cultivator appeared.

Sun Lingtong sharply turned to see an individual hunched over, skin swollen grotesquely, with dark bags beneath bloodshot eyes. Wet hair constantly dripped water, as though he’d just crawled from a river.

A shiver of fear ran down Sun Lingtong’s spine!

He hadn’t even realized someone had been following him!

Jin Yangzi maintained his haughty posture, coldly asking, “Who are you?”

The mysterious cultivator stared at Jin Yangzi with his eerie, bloodshot eyes, “The one here to claim your life.”

Jin Yangzi burst into arrogant laughter, “A nameless nobody dares threaten me, Jin Yangzi? Don’t you realize I’ve known about your pursuit all along and deliberately lured you here?”

Before finishing his sentence, Jin Yangzi struck suddenly, slicing forward with a radiant golden blade formed by his palm.

As he acted, he unleashed the aura of a Golden Core cultivator, fiercely asserting his dominance.

However, as the fierce golden blade approached the mysterious cultivator, its brilliance rapidly diminished. By the time it reached him, it was reduced to the size of a mere marble, its formidable power all but extinguished.

The mysterious cultivator flicked it away effortlessly, shattering it into fragments. A chilling smile spread across his face as he spoke, his voice dripping with malevolence. “Did you truly think you’d discovered me by accident? Foolish. It was by design.”

He continued, his voice echoing eerily. “I counted on your arrogance to draw me out, Jin Yangzi. Your pride is precisely what seals your doom!”

In an instant, the alleyway vanished, replaced by a grand waterfall plunging into a deep, turbulent pool. This was his Domain - Hidden Scales of the Dragon Pool.

Jin Yangzi’s eyes narrowed sharply as he quickly soared into the sky, avoiding the churning waters. Sun Lingtong, caught off guard, leaped onto a precarious rock in the pool, positioned awkwardly between the two powerful cultivators.

Standing opposite Jin Yangzi at the pool’s edge, the mysterious cultivator unleashed his attack. With a wave of his hand, he summoned a dragon-shaped surge of water from the pool. The watery dragon lunged towards Jin Yangzi, who swiftly drew a long spear, its tip radiating brilliant light. A casual jab from the spear shattered the aquatic beast effortlessly.

Jin Yangzi sneered contemptuously, “Your domain surprised me. You’re a devotee of the Hidden Scale Dragon Lord? Nevertheless, these petty attacks are barely worth my attention!”

“Is that so?” The mysterious cultivator smirked ominously, launching a flurry of water-based techniques. Yet, regardless of how cleverly the water twisted and took shape, Jin Yangzi dismissed each attack with mocking ease.

“Something’s terribly wrong here!” Sun Lingtong thought anxiously, sensing a hidden danger.

Fortunately, neither combatant targeted him, each fully focused on the other as their primary enemy.

Jin Yangzi effortlessly deflected another series of strikes, his confidence turning to irritation. “Are you mocking me? Enough of your games! Show me your true strength!”

The mysterious cultivator chuckled darkly. “I’ve already revealed my power.”

Jin Yangzi growled in anger. “If this is all you have, mere Foundation Establishment tricks, I’ll shred you to pieces!”

“Jin Yangzi, for all your bravado, you’ve yet to notice your predicament,” the mysterious cultivator replied coldly.

Startled, Jin Yangzi quickly scanned himself with his divine sense but initially found nothing amiss. His face soon twisted in horror as the mysterious cultivator activated another technique.

Suddenly, Jin Yangzi’s artifacts and enchanted items - his robes, boots, and more - were enveloped by mist and stripped from his body. Desperately, he channeled his energy to reclaim them, but discovered his connection to these treasures had been completely severed.

“What sorcery is this?!” Jin Yangzi roared in fury and shock.

Sun Lingtong’s eyes widened in realization. “Overturned Water! This is the legendary Overturned Water!”

Overturned Water - a sinister treasure of the water element known for severing all connections with whatever it enveloped. As the proverb went, spilled water cannot be gathered again.

Jin Yangzi realized too late that most of his treasures had been corrupted, rendered useless by Overturned Water.

In a last-ditch effort, he transformed into his true form - a majestic golden crow - and attempted to escape by soaring skyward. Yet the mighty waterfall surged down mercilessly, crashing him back to the ground.

Within the powerful torrent, a blinding golden light burst forth. Jin Yangzi unleashed his desperate demon art - Crimson Blood Golden Light Slash! Though extremely taxing, its destructive power far surpassed a cultivator’s normal limits.

The mysterious cultivator grunted softly. A dragon’s resonant roar emanated from the waterfall, rapidly consuming and weakening Jin Yangzi’s desperate strike until its dazzling radiance was utterly extinguished.

Jin Yangzi clenched his teeth, helpless against the overwhelming power.

“This is truly dire!” Sun Lingtong thought desperately. He had hoped Jin Yangzi might break free of the domain, providing a chance to escape. Instead, Jin Yangzi was thoroughly suppressed, sealing their grim fate.

“Even if this is your domain, I still have recognition within White Paper Immortal City and remain unaffected by its grand formation!” Jin Yangzi glared fiercely at the mysterious cultivator. “You’re also at the Golden Core stage, yet you’re similarly unrestricted. Who exactly are you?!”

The mysterious cultivator smiled chillingly. “The one who’ll end your life.”

Massive waves surged violently, submerging Jin Yangzi with merciless force.

Jin Yangzi frantically beat his wings, using all his strength to break free. Time after time, he managed to briefly escape the surging waters, only to be ruthlessly hammered back down by the cascading waterfall.

After several exhausting cycles, Jin Yangzi gradually weakened, the golden glow representing his life force eventually extinguishing beneath the turbulent pool.

“Thieving Technique - Piercing the Void!”

Sun Lingtong desperately attempted to flee amidst despair.

But the mysterious cultivator didn’t even need to act personally. The domain alone sufficed to nullify Sun Lingtong’s escape, rendering his efforts completely futile.

“Within this domain, any method used by my enemies is significantly weakened.”

“Little Zhuo, save me quickly!”

In that instant, the life-and-death moment ignited the life-saving treasure, erupting with blinding mirror-like radiance.

The brilliant light enveloped Sun Lingtong, causing him to vanish instantly.

When he reappeared, he was back inside Residence A-01 in the Hidden Yang Manor. Ning Zhuo stood with his Life-Bound Artifact, the Spirit Communing Mirror, having successfully rescued Sun Lingtong.

“What happened, boss?” Ning Zhuo had reacted urgently only after hearing the desperate cry for help and was still unaware of the preceding events.

Sun Lingtong patted his chest, breathing raggedly. “That was… way too intense…”

For a moment, he struggled to speak clearly.

“Hmm?” The mysterious cultivator was astonished to see Sun Lingtong escape.

“That technique was externally invoked and ignored the suppression of my domain. It seems like some sort of summoning method.”

“No matter.”

“Jin Yangzi’s death was never something that could be concealed anyway, nor did I intend to hide it.”

“White Paper Immortal City,” he chuckled sinisterly, “is finally about to descend into chaos.”

The mysterious cultivator produced a bone orb, casually tossing it forward. It transformed into an ominous ghostly gateway.

As the gateway opened, countless water ghosts and ghostly soldiers surged forth, having long been prepared for this moment!

Shortly thereafter, miserable screams and frantic calls for help filled the previously quiet alleys, plunging the area into complete disorder.

The ghostly soldiers marched out!

Clang! Clang! Clang!

The alarm bells of White Paper Immortal City resonated urgently, echoing through the entire city.

The city’s great formation activated, aggressively suppressing the emergent tide of water ghosts.

The city guards swiftly mobilized.

Yet, halfway through their deployment, new orders arrived from the upper echelons, redirecting a large portion of the cultivators to defend the city walls.

The Ghost Tide had arrived earlier than anticipated!
