Chapter 440: Seamless Shadow Cut

The Three Generals Battalion.

The soldiers formed battle formations, orderly arranged, resembling a thick python slowly traversing the mountains.

Liu Er rode a yellow horse, gently stroking the Xuanhuang Sword in his hand.

This treasured sword was heavy and blunt; its blade was earthy yellow with black patterns on the surface, resembling the roots of the earth.

The hilt was black, with circles of earthy yellow rings spaced apart, containing the essence of sedimentation and protection in the way of the earth element.

Ning Zhuo had gifted Liu Er the Xuanhuang Mother Stone, which was crafted by the national craftsman Jin Li using the weapon blueprint provided by Liu Er.

This was not a magical artifact but a weapon.

Magical artifacts focus more on the casting of spells, while weapons contain military tactics that mostly affect people and objects, imposing positive or negative influences on them.

Spells and military tactics were hard to integrate; basically, one could only choose one as the content for crafting.

In practical use, cultivators would not forcibly combine spells and military tactics into one magical artifact. The difficulty was too great, and the cost was too high.

With such resources, it was better to craft magical artifacts and weapons separately!

Liu Er held the sword hilt, feeling the heaviness and power of the Xuanhuang Sword. In a trance, he seemed to sense the pulse of the earth.

"Truly worthy of being a weapon personally made by Jin Li."

Liu Er was fond of this weapon, knowing that in this campaign to establish merits, he would rely heavily on this treasured sword in battlefield slaughter.

In the shadows cast on the ground by him and his mount, a pair of eyes quietly opened.

It was Wu Hen!

Wu Hen's eyes were filled with black blood vessels, appearing eerie and gloomy.

Wu Hen observed Liu Er, feeling quite speechless.

Obviously, the Xuanhuang Sword was a heavy, blunt weapon—a treasure for defense. Liu Er held the hilt with one hand and stroked the blade with the other. How could Wu Hen launch a surprise attack?

There was simply no opportunity.

If Wu Hen were acting alone, he might choose to continue observing, waiting for Liu Er to sheathe the sword and expose a flaw.

But now, many Golden Core cultivators like Chen Lingfeng were waiting for him to make a move.

Wu Hen decisively gave up on Liu Er and leaped between shadows. Sometimes, he waited for the moment when the cultivators' shadows connected with the surrounding trees and rocks to transfer.

Ordinary stealth techniques couldn't achieve his level of excellence.

This was because when the soldiers of the Three Generals Battalion marched, they were always in formation. Military power flowed; the army was organized, possessing the might of national defense.

Very few stealth techniques could move among them. Most scouts with some skill could only risk getting close for a short distance and observe cautiously from afar.

Wu Hen searched all the way and found a strong man in the middle of the team.

This burly man was eight feet tall, with a short thick neck, a face full of black beard like steel needles, and a surging Golden Core aura. He was Zhang Hei.

Zhang Hei was riding a black horse, holding a whip. He was not stealthily advancing with the army but was standing by the roadside, observing the military formation.

Whenever he saw individual cultivators moving slowly, distracted, or slacking off, he would whip them directly while cursing loudly.

"Move faster!"

"Still slacking off during formation?"

"Hey! How dare you glare at me?!"

Zhang Hei was quite hot-tempered towards disobedient soldiers. The whip caused the soldiers to scream constantly, but it did make them more alert, their movements quicker and more standard, maintaining the stability of the straight snake formation.

Wu Hen watched from afar and did not approach.

Seeing Zhang Hei constantly whipping the soldiers, he felt quite speechless.

Zhang Hei was furious, his aura surging, tension high; he didn't look like someone easy to ambush.

At this moment, Zhang Hei's whip suddenly stopped. He only pointed and cursed with the whip, restraining himself a lot.

While Wu Hen was puzzled, he saw a carriage advancing along the team.

When the carriage reached Zhang Hei, a small window on the carriage opened, revealing a young cultivator with a fair face and bright eyes.

The young man said to Zhang Hei in a helpless tone, "General Zhang, I've heard your cursing from afar. Are you whipping the soldiers again?"

Zhang Hei hurriedly denied, "No, no. Since the military advisor complained to Brother Xiang, I hardly do such things anymore."

The young man shook his head, "Listening to General Zhang, it seems you blame me for complaining?"

Zhang Hei denied again, "How could that be!? The military advisor is naturally thinking of our army. I, Old Hei, have always been mindful of the advisor's goodness. Look at my Black Snake Spear. Without the treasured materials gifted by the military advisor, how could it have been crafted?"

"Sigh, General Zhang, please take care of yourself." Ning Zhuo let go of the curtain and returned to being alone.

His carriage was arranged with a formation; the space was the size of a room, not as cramped as it appeared from the outside.

In the entire Three Generals Battalion, only he currently had such special treatment. Even the three Golden Core generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang were riding Foundation Establishment-level warhorses.

Wu Hen's heart moved: "He is Ning Zhuo?"

Comparing with the information in his mind, Wu Hen confirmed his guess.

He had a thought and immediately attached himself to the large shadow of the carriage, silently sneaking into the carriage without anyone noticing.

Wu Hen: !!?

As soon as he entered the carriage, he was shocked.

He saw Ning Zhuo sitting, leaning against the carriage wall, his head lowered, studying mechanism books.

To his left stood a mechanical ape, clad in heavy armor, exuding a strong blood aura.

On the seat to his right sat a mechanical puppet in the form of an adult woman with Golden Core aura.

Whether it was the mechanical ape or the female puppet, both made Wu Hen feel they were not easy to provoke.

What caught his attention the most was the long mechanical scythe held in the hand of the female puppet.

From this mechanical scythe, Wu Hen sensed the Dao and principles he was very familiar with.

That was the Dao related to "Monsters."

"Night Rain Demon Soldier?!"

"And an extraordinary Night Rain Demon Soldier!"

Wu Hen's heart was pounding, unable to stay calm.

He relied on his special cultivation techniques and spells related to Monsters to infiltrate the Three Generals Battalion and sneak into Canglin Immortal City to gather intelligence.

This was because cultivation techniques and spells related to Monsters were hard to understand and even harder to cultivate.

Therefore, most cultivators lacked understanding and found it difficult to comprehend, naturally making it hard to guard against such methods.

Compared to cultivating himself to success, a more practical and feasible way was to collect related magical artifacts for research and use.

Therefore, since the Night Rain Dynasty, many powerful cultivators had been widely collecting Night Rain Demon Soldiers.

Wu Hen held his breath and carefully left the carriage.

The female mechanical puppet emitted a Golden Core aura and held an extraordinary Night Rain Demon Soldier. Wu Hen had no confidence to assassinate Ning Zhuo.

Even if the assassination succeeded, the spells he relied on would no longer have the advantage in front of the scythe.

Once he was entangled and the entire army surrounded him, could Wu Hen still escape alive?

He had infiltrated here to earn battle merits, not to commit suicide!

Therefore, Ning Zhuo was not a suitable target either.

Wu Hen left the carriage somewhat awkwardly and moved along the team all the way to the end, where he saw Guan Hong.

Guan Hong sat on a red-maned horse, not stroking his weapon, the Blood Dragon Blade, nor scolding the soldiers, but... combing his beard.

His beard was thick and eight zhang long, jet-black and shiny, almost dragging on the ground as he moved.

Guan Hong would take out some time every day to groom his long beard.

Seeing this, Wu Hen's heart lifted; he finally found a suitable target!

He immediately hid in the shadow of the red-maned horse, silently brewing.

Spell—Seamless Shadow Cut!

At this moment, the shadow under Guan Hong suddenly expanded, and Wu Hen emerged from it.

His face was withered and pale, his long black hair disheveled, wearing a tattered black robe. The edges of his robe and the ends of his hair were attached with shadows, forming a lingering connection between him and Guan Hong's shadow.

Wu Hen's magical power gushed from his hand, transforming into a pair of scissors, fiercely cutting towards Guan Hong's neck.

If this cut landed, Guan Hong's head would be severed like his shadow.

At the life-and-death moment, Guan Hong's heart pounded wildly, his mind seized by an incomparable sense of crisis.

At the same time, the soldiers marching behind him saw Wu Hen and exclaimed in surprise.

Guan Hong didn't have time to turn his head. His divine sense concentrated, detecting the previously undetectable Wu Hen.

He "saw" Wu Hen about to cut his neck and instinctively raised his right arm to meet the scissors.

Reflected on the ground, Guan Hong's raised right arm met the tip of the scissors in advance.

Guan Hong felt excruciating pain!

And Wu Hen felt the scissors pierce into flesh, difficult to pull out.

He could only go with the flow and close the scissor blades.

Even as tough as Guan Hong was, he groaned in pain. The wound on his right arm appeared, a huge gash almost severing his arm!

With rich combat experience, he didn't think twice and drew out the Blood Dragon Blade with his left hand, slashing towards Wu Hen.

Wu Hen laughed eerily and directly dived into the horse's shadow.

Blade Technique—Hundred Zhang Pursuit!

The blood-colored blade light locked onto Wu Hen, following into the horse's shadow.

The next moment, Guan Hong's mount, the red-maned horse, neighed miserably and suddenly exploded, flesh and blood flying, blade energy wildly raging in all directions.

Guan Hong had clearly locked onto Wu Hen, but instead, he had mistakenly struck his own mount.

He was seriously injured, failed to counterattack Wu Hen, and caused his mount to perish!

After making his move, Wu Hen immediately moved through the shadows, fleeing frantically.

Numerous spells bombarded the ground but didn't harm him in the slightest.

After a dozen breaths, he successfully escaped the enemy army, fully displaying the style of the Monster Dao.

Because the soldiers attacked Wu Hen, the formation fell into chaos, causing the straight snake formation of the Three Generals Battalion to malfunction, revealing a significant flaw.

Seeing this commotion, several Golden Core cultivators who had been waiting outside took action together!

In an instant, several spells blasted towards the soldiers of the Three Generals Battalion from four directions.

The Three Generals Battalion had always been in formation and reacted instantly.

Liu Er and Zhang Hei acted simultaneously, each intercepting a spell in mid-air. Guan Hong was injured, acted a beat slower, and only intercepted half.

Ning Zhuo ordered Yuan Dasheng to take action, who only bore most of the spell's power.

The remaining two or three spells struck the soldiers, killing... more than thirty cultivators on the spot.
