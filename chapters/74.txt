Chapter 74: Something Isn’t Right

Zhu Xuanji let out a cold snort. “So you all are suspecting me now!

“My Golden Pupils can see through heaven and earth. How could mere flames block my gaze?

“I saw that the old ape had cultivated a profound demonic technique, but never used it. Instead, it risked its own life to protect its master.

“This is true loyalty!

“How many of us humans could go to such lengths?

“I was moved by its loyalty, and couldn’t bear to let it die. That’s why I healed it.”

At this point, Zhu Xuanji’s tone turned firm. “But it’s precisely because I healed it myself that I had the chance to not only look with my Golden Pupils but also probe it with my magical power.

“I can say with complete certainty that aside from its serious injuries, there was nothing wrong with the old ape. There was absolutely no black shadow demonic cultivator hiding inside of it!”

The others fell silent again at Zhu Xuanji’s resolute words.

If that was true, there were no more doubts.

The more likely explanation was that someone had secretly released the black shadow demonic cultivator ahead of time.

Fei Si’s brow gradually furrowed. He opened his mouth as if to speak, but closed it again.

The Zhou Clan old ancestor also frowned, but pressed on with his questioning. “Sir Zhu, forgive my boldness, but can you truly be certain there is no mistake?

“Are there no spells or divine abilities in this world that can deceive both your Golden Pupils and your magical power?”

Zhu Xuanji let out a cold laugh. “Now you’re just being unreasonable.

“Who can guarantee perfection?

“This world has countless geniuses and endless prodigies. There are an infinite number of spells, divine abilities, and magic treasures. How could I possibly know them all?

“Let me tell you, my Golden Pupils innate talent is already almost at the level of a divine ability. In my ten-plus years with the Divine Investigation Bureau, I’ve only encountered three Golden Core cultivators who could resist my Golden Pupils’ insight. Below the Golden Core realm, no living thing has ever escaped my eyes.”

Once again, silence fell.

However, seeking to completely rid himself of suspicion, Zhu Xuanji suggested, “Since some of you seem to still distrust me, let’s go find that old ape now. Everyone can examine it personally. How about that?”

“That makes sense!” Chi Dun nodded.

“Very well,” The Zhou Clan old ancestor agreed as well.

Fei Si, though, felt a chill in his heart.

He thought again of Ning Zhuo.

After the incident, Ning Zhuo had taken the initiative to suggest persuading Yuan Er to surrender and coercing or bribing him into killing the old ape.

Who knew how far things had progressed by now?

The thought of Ning Zhuo still holding his order token made Fei Si even more anxious.

However, he kept a calm exterior. “I also have my doubts about this matter. Seeing it with my own eyes wouldn’t hurt.

“Here’s what we’ll do. Chi Dun, you stay here and continue leading the rest of the Golden Core cultivators in the search. There may be people hiding underground. We can’t let anyone slip away!”

Fei Si then invited the Zhou Clan old ancestor and Zhu Xuanji to go with himself and investigate Yuan Dasheng.

Chi Dun was displeased. “Why do I have to stay behind? You should be the one handling this!”

Fei Si silenced him with one sentence. “Sir City Lord appointed me to oversee the Fire Persimmon Festival; are you saying you won’t follow my command?”

Chi Dun snorted coldly but had no choice but to comply.

The three Golden Core cultivators flew off together toward the Monkey Head Gang’s headquarters.

Yuan Er was still kneeling by the bedside in a daze.

Suddenly, the three Golden Core cultivators descended from the sky, crashing through the rooftop and towering over him.

Yuan Er trembled in fright.

“Where’s your old ape?” Zhu Xuanji swept his divine sense through the rear courtyard, already noticing something off.

Yuan Er’s face turned deathly pale. He burst into tears. “He’s dead. My Uncle Monkey is dead!”

Zhu Xuanji’s eyes flared with golden light. His voice was sharp as he said, “I gave you a Late Autumn Life Preservation Pill. How did the old ape die?”

Yuan Er was shaking like a leaf. Too scared to hide anything, he quickly stammered out the whole story.

When Zhu Xuanji finished listening, his face turned pale with anger. He pointed at Yuan Er. “You ungrateful wretch!”

Then he turned to Fei Si. “Very good! Fei Si, this is your doing? How clever of you.”

Fei Si was inwardly delighted. “I didn’t expect Ning Zhuo to move so fast. Well done!”

He was in a good mood after regaining the upper hand. Narrowing his eyes, he said slowly, “Thank you for the compliment, Sir Zhu.

“I’m only thinking of Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

“After all, using monkey pets to harvest fire persimmons is rather cruel. Three Schools Supreme Sage was full of benevolence; if he hadn’t left behind Lava Immortal Palace back then, Fire Persimmon Mountain wouldn’t be the paradise it is today.

“As members of the latter generation, we should fully embrace Three Schools Supreme Sage’s spirit, let these monkeys go, and switch entirely to mechanical constructs. That’s what we call compassion for all living beings. It’s a benevolent and merciful governing policy.”

Fei Si pretended not to hear the sarcasm in Zhu Xuanji’s voice and earnestly praised himself.

Zhu Xuanji was so angry his breathing turned rough, his pale face tinged with green.

Fei Si felt even more satisfied.

This wasn’t just a matter of saving face.

Righteous cultivators couldn’t fight as directly and bloodily as demonic cultivators.

So these confrontations within the confines of the rules had become the measure of a cultivator’s strength.

Fame and profit were closely intertwined. Having a resounding reputation often led to real, tangible benefits.

Being publicly forced by Zhu Xuanji to open the formation had shown Fei Si in a weak light. In the future, many would likely lean more toward Zhu Xuanji. This would undermine Fei Si’s authority and weaken his influence.

Going further, it would even diminish the influence of the City Lord Mansion and the current City Lord, Meng Kui.

As a representative of the royal family and the Divine Investigation Bureau, Zhu Xuanji was already in a power struggle with Meng Kui’s faction.

If Fei Si didn’t strike back, or more precisely, didn’t strike back properly within the rules, Meng Kui would surely be disappointed.

Now that he had won a round and balanced out the earlier negative impact, he could finally breathe easier.

The Zhou Clan old ancestor stood to the side with a frown. He was completely unwilling to get involved in the conflict between Fei Si and Zhu Xuanji. As a third party, it was still much too early for him to step in and take a side.

He was more focused on solving the matter of the black shadow demonic cultivator, so he said, “Since the old ape has already been taken away, what are we still doing here?

“Brother Fei, where is your messenger now?” The Zhou Clan old ancestor asked Fei Si.

The immortal city grand formation greatly suppressed divine sense, but Fei Si had the necessary authority. He immediately borrowed the grand formation’s power to extend his divine sense and sensed the location of his order token.

“Follow me!” Fei Si took the lead and flew away from the Monkey Head Gang.

Zhu Xuanji and the Zhou Clan old ancestor followed closely behind.

Three arcs of light crossed the sky and soon landed at the Flying Disk Workshop.

Zhu Xuanji reached out and made a grabbing motion in the air. An invisible force immediately ripped off the rooftop, revealing Ning Zhuo and Chen Cha inside.

The old ape that the three Golden Core cultivators had been searching for was lying on the mechanical pedestal. Its essence blood had already been drained, and it was on the verge of being dismembered.

“Stop at once!” The Zhou Clan old ancestor shouted sharply.

Ning Zhuo and Chen Cha were shocked and hurriedly bowed in greeting.

The three Golden Core cultivators ignored them and released their divine sense, sweeping it fully over Yuan Dasheng’s corpse.

They found no trace of any demonic cultivator hidden within.

“It did indeed cultivate a demonic technique, and to a decently high level as well,” the Zhou Clan old ancestor said.

Zhu Xuanji once again confirmed the results of his earlier inspection. He glanced regretfully at the old ape’s corpse, then turned his gaze toward Ning Zhuo. “You little brat, you really have a silver tongue. Yuan Er was a fool to be so easily convinced by you.”

Ning Zhuo took a deep breath and said nervously, “Sir Zhu, please analyze things fairly. My cooperation with Yuan Er is beneficial for both of us. I want to make money, and Yuan Er wants to keep his position as gang leader.

“Please forgive my boldness – Sir, you acted with compassion and righteousness in saving the old ape. But was that really a good thing for it? Given its loyalty to its master, don’t you think it would rather die than become a burden?”

“Hmph, slick words and a sharp tongue!” Zhu Xuanji’s opinion of Ning Zhuo dropped rapidly.

Standing off to the side, Fei Si stroked his beard and was even more impressed with Ning Zhuo.

The three Golden Core cultivators found nothing suspicious. Soon, they flew off.

Fei Si led them back to Fire Persimmon Forest, but Zhu Xuanji came to a sudden stop mid-flight.

His brow furrowed deeply as he thought hard. “I keep getting the feeling that something isn’t right!”
