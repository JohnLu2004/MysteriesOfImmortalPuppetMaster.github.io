Chapter 405: Spirit Direction

At this moment, another Law Body retired from the long battle and revealed his form.

This person had a broad forehead and jet-black hair, tied simply with a cloth band.

He was tall and slender, walking with composure, wearing a plain-colored robe with a blue medicine pouch and a simple bamboo flute hanging from his belt.

In one hand he held a gnarled wooden staff, and in the other, a manuscript.

The manuscript bore the title - "Xu Xing's Travelogue."

This was another historical figure whose image was quite iconic in various classical texts. Thus, everyone recognized his identity at first glance.

Xu Xing!

This man was a famous traveler who in his lifetime had traversed famous mountains and rivers, viewed the five lakes, roamed the four seas, and explored many dangerous secret realms. His travel records, known as "Xu Xing's Travelogue," were highly sought after by later generations.

Xu Xing's Travelogue consisted of sixteen volumes. Since Xu Xing's death, they had never been collected in their entirety. Many volumes recording the exploration of secret realms and methods of entry were tightly controlled by various major powers and forbidden from being shared.

Xu Xing, quite fond of excellent juniors like Ning Zhuo, hurried to explain: "This relates to the limits of the Linglong Mirror Wall and the origins of the dynasties."

"The Linglong Mirror Wall was formed during the Martial Emperor's era when the world had not yet assimilated the ways of demons and monsters. The Mirror Wall was limited to the original principles of heaven and earth."

"Therefore, while it could reflect the ways of the Five Elements, Yin and Yang, the Four Symbols, and the Eight Trigrams, it could not reflect the ways of demons and monsters."

Ning Zhuo immediately seemed to understand.

Xu Xing continued: "This world has three great dynasties, essentially arising from the prosperity of external ways that disrupted the old order."

"For instance, the Blood Remnant Dynasty brought the principles of demons and monsters that were captured by the world, and from then on, this world had demons and monsters."

"After the Forbidden Dynasty, the world gained gods and buddhas."

"After the Night Rain Dynasty, the world saw ghosts and spirits."

"External ways capable of brewing dynasties were all very powerful, able to cause upheaval in heaven and earth and reshuffle power structures."

"But for these external ways, the Linglong Mirror Wall was quite fragile and unable to reflect them. Only after heaven and earth adapted and assimilated them could the Mirror Wall benefit and have some involvement with these external ways."

The Five Elements Divine Lord interjected: "Previously, Ning Zhuo, the purple blade mark you displayed came from the Night Rain Dynasty, manifesting the external way of ghosts and spirits."

"The Linglong Mirror Wall couldn't digest it and couldn't reflect it. Although the damage was minimal, it fundamentally couldn't be absorbed, so it could only be expelled."

Ning Zhuo suddenly understood completely.

The Linglong Mirror Wall was crafted too early, having inherent limitations that made it unable to adapt to and bear external ways.

Even though the Night Rain Dynasty had passed so many years ago, it still couldn't adapt to the way of ghosts and spirits, and could only process them through expulsion.

Therefore, whenever a new dynasty appeared, it inevitably meant that an extremely powerful external way had been absorbed by the world. During such periods, the emerging talents and masters were all exceptional practitioners of external ways.

The Linglong Mirror Wall couldn't reflect these people, and they even posed quite a threat to it.

Thus, with each dynasty, the Linglong Mirror Wall would sink into the earth's core, avoiding the world.

This also explained why the Five Elements Divine Lord was so shocked upon seeing the purple blade mark earlier.

Logically, since the Linglong Mirror Wall absorbed the Law Bodies of later generations, the Five Elements Divine Lord, being a veteran here, should have seen it before.

But when he saw the purple blade mark, he was quite surprised, visibly shaken.

The Linglong Mirror Wall had avoided the world during both the Forbidden Dynasty and the Night Rain Dynasty, stepping aside from great eras. Though it missed many spectacular events, it was precisely such measures that allowed it to survive until today!

The Jade Immortal Princess took the initiative to discuss cooperation with everyone.

Previously, through the Grass Saint, she had revealed to Lin Bufan to try to demonstrate martial arts within the Ten Thousand Medicines Valley to attract excellent successors, making it convenient.

But Lin Bufan could only attract those at the Foundation Establishment and Golden Core levels.

This was quite insufficient for the Linglong Mirror Wall.

Now, with Ning Zhuo representing the Ning family and Zhu Xuanji representing the Southern Bean royal family, the Jade Immortal Princess had more choices.

She hoped that Ning Zhuo, Zhu Xuanji, and others could recruit excellent young cultivators for the Linglong Mirror Wall - the higher their strength and talent, the better.

The Jade Immortal Princess was preventing the situation where, hundreds of years later, a dynasty would emerge, causing the Linglong Mirror Wall to avoid the world for many years, during which the demon plums within would evolve, and the old Law Bodies would struggle to suppress the demon beasts' counterattack, ultimately leading to the failure of suppression and sealing.

Therefore, at this juncture before a great era of strife, the Jade Immortal Princess needed to absorb more battle power.

To make an analogy, the Linglong Mirror Wall was like a giant whale that, before sinking into the deep sea for long-term swimming, came to the surface to absorb air.

At this time, the air it needed to absorb should naturally be as much and as high quality as possible.

But the Jade Immortal Princess didn't want to make a big show of it.

After all, the Linglong Mirror Wall was a quasi-immortal artifact of extreme value. If it attracted contemporary major powers or those of profound cultivation to take action and claim the Mirror Wall for themselves, that wouldn't be good.

More worrying was encountering some cultivators with ulterior motives, or getting caught in the small vortex of power struggles, where the Linglong Mirror Wall's sealing and suppression might be interfered with or destroyed - that would greatly violate the original purpose of the Mirror Wall's creation!

Faced with the Jade Immortal Princess's proposal for cooperation, Lin Bufan's expression was complicated, while both the Zhu and Ning parties readily agreed.

You must be joking!

Only a complete fool would refuse!

The demon disciples represented an endless, continuous source of materials, which also meant a source of wealth.

The numerous sage Law Bodies represented numerous excellent inheritances.

Used properly, the Linglong Mirror Wall would become the best place for martial arts demonstration and training.

The national power of the Myriad Medicine Sect, the Ning family, the Zhu family, and even the Southern Bean country would all improve because of this cooperation!

The negotiations regarding this cooperation lasted three days and three nights.

After the negotiations concluded, Ning Zhuo, with heavy dark circles under his eyes, fell asleep immediately.

When he woke up the next day, he still felt mentally exhausted and spiritually drained, having truly given his all in the negotiations.

But there was no choice!

The enormous interests involved meant he had to strive for the best possible outcome. Getting more at this point would make the entire Ning branch family's development speed increase several or dozens of times! Their future strength would also expand several or dozens of times over.

Ning Zhuo and Ning Jiufan worked as one, leveraging the Zhu family to squeeze out the Myriad Medicine Sect, arguing reasonably with the Jade Immortal Princess, pulling in Linghu Jiu, using relationships with the Five Elements Divine Lord and the Lonely Sword Lord, constantly haggling. This left Linghu Jiu dumbfounded and Lin Shanshan grinding her teeth in anger.

The final result was that Ning Zhuo had bitten off a huge piece of meat.

As long as the cooperation continued, for nearly five hundred years, Ning Zhuo and the entire Ning clan would benefit extraordinarily from this, and the entire branch family's development speed would once again be boosted, rising significantly!

Ten Thousand Medicines Valley.

In the highest-level medicinal field formation, Ning Zhuo cupped his hands in greeting: "Miss Lin."

Lin Shanshan gave him an annoyed glance, then bowed to Ning Jiufan who had come along: "Senior Ning, Young Master Ning, please follow me this way."

During the previous negotiations, Ning Zhuo had essentially torn off his face, arguing red-faced with Lin Bufan multiple times, deeply offending this daughter of the sect leader again.

Their relationship, which had slightly improved before, once again dropped to freezing point.

To the extent that when Ning Zhuo tried to make conversation with Lin Shanshan, he got no response.

Lin Shanshan led Ning Zhuo into the formation within formations.

Here, he saw Lin Bufan again, as well as the Spirit Concealment Willow.

The Spirit Concealment Willow now showed signs of green, with at least half of its previously withered branches becoming full - a great improvement compared to its previous dead state.

Ning Jiufan stroked his chin and immediately praised: "Young man, I told you entrusting this spirit plant to Sect Leader Lin wouldn't be wrong."

Ning Zhuo was quite delighted, circling the tree three times and patting its trunk: "Old Willow, after all my hard work, I've finally managed to save you back to health."

The willow branches swayed lightly, as if wanting to brush Ning Zhuo's face, but only moved slightly before stopping halfway, appearing like a patient just recovered from a serious illness failing to raise their hand, lacking strength.

Lin Bufan: .......

He felt quite speechless and immediately stated that to save this Spirit Concealment Willow, he had used various resources, as it was a rare item. He had given it his all and even mobilized the elders within the Myriad Medicine Sect to work together, expending great effort to achieve this result.

The implication was: how did it become your achievement in your mouth, Ning Zhuo?

Ning Zhuo waved his hand: "Oh, Sect Leader Lin, we've already signed the alliance, we're on the same side now. Isn't your achievement my achievement too? Why be so particular about it?"

Lin Bufan was angered into laughter.

Lin Shanshan glared at Ning Zhuo, who gave her a grin in return, angering her to grind her teeth, yet she could do nothing about Ning Zhuo.

Lin Bufan quickly composed himself.

Since the last negotiation, he had deeply experienced Ning Zhuo's shamelessness and thick skin. The latter was extremely good at using his junior status, and many times Lin Bufan wanted to deal with him but was constrained by his senior status, unable to take action without losing face.

"The spirit spring is here, it's up to you two now," Lin Bufan pointed.

Ning Zhuo nodded repeatedly: "Rest assured, Sect Leader Lin, now that the alliance is signed, the matter of leasing the Ten Thousand Year Water Crystal is set in stone, I absolutely won't go back on my word."

Saying this, he took out two Ten Thousand Year Water Crystals from the mechanical dragon at his waist and placed them into the spirit spring's eye.

This Ten Thousand Year Water Crystal was naturally given by the Jade Immortal Princess after leaving the Linglong Mirror Wall.

One for Ning Zhuo, one for Sun Lingtong.

But Old Sun took the Ten Thousand Year Water Crystal and felt it useless. When Ning Zhuo wanted to borrow it, he very straightforwardly lent it to Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo, leveraging these two Ten Thousand Year Water Crystals as conditions during negotiations, had moved Lin Bufan.

This was because when a Ten Thousand Year Water Crystal was placed in any water body, it would provide enormous amplification.

Seeing the Ten Thousand Year Water Crystals placed in, Lin Bufan confirmed and then activated the formation to heavily conceal the spirit spring.

"Why wasn't Brother Linghu's crystal put in?" Ning Zhuo felt confused and casually asked.

Lin Bufan coldly snorted without answering.

Lin Shanshan gave Ning Zhuo a glare, also not responding.

Ning Zhuo didn't ask further. He walked to Lin Bufan's front and extended his hand: "Sect Leader Lin?"

The next moment, Lin Bufan took out the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat: "This boat is my Myriad Medicine Sect's inheritance treasure, I hope Young Master Ning Zhuo will take good care of it."

Ning Zhuo said: "Don't worry, don't worry, Sect Leader Lin. My inheritance treasure is here with you too."

He pointed at the Spirit Concealment Willow.

Then, feeling the small boat in his palm, he sighed: "Ah, as the branch family clan leader, I've really worried myself sick for the clan members."

"I hope the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat can help them."

After saying this, he tucked the Embryonic Breath Boat into his bosom.

While saying this, Ning Zhuo was already planning how to quickly burn this spirit box to exchange for his mother's spirit nature.

"The key is that this spirit boat is only borrowed, if I burn it nearby, Lin Bufan will definitely sense it."

"Better to run far away before doing this!"
