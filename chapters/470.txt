Chapter 470: The Hero Returns Again

The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon was now once again coiled around Ning Zhuo’s waist.

Most of the spoils inside had already been sold off, exchanged for spirit stones that filled several cabins.

Now, Ning Zhuo no longer needed to worry about the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon’s cost of traveling through the void—

He was very wealthy!

Sun Lingtong, looking very small, sat cross-legged on the ground, wearing the generals-and-soldiers-shared-helmet.

The large helmet sat atop his small head. The back half of the helmet covered a small portion of Sun Lingtong’s upper back, making the disparity between them quite evident.

Sun Lingtong’s physical foundation was far more robust than before.

Although the helmet was heavy, he could easily support it with his head.

While supporting the helmet, he flipped through the military manual “Gao Sheng’s Posthumous Writings” in his hand.

This military manual was tattered and incomplete. Sun Lingtong, who had no real mastery of military strategy, knew the characters, but found them hard to understand when combined.

As he read further, the strategic content became more profound. Misunderstanding even one character could lead to a completely different outcome.

The key point was that the manual had many gaps, missing numerous words, and sometimes even large sections of text.

This piece of military treasure was excellent for use in battle, but as teaching material, it truly put the reader in a difficult position.

But now, the situation was different—Sun Lingtong had put on the generals-and-soldiers-shared-helmet!

As he continued flipping through the pages, his divine sense delved into the manual. His eyes became unfocused as he fell into a state of comprehension.

In a daze, he became an ordinary soldier in the army, his steps heavy and slow. During a nighttime sneak attack, he suddenly could not help letting out a loud fart. This caused the enemy to discover them, and the entire ambush failed.

Then he became a small leader. His temper was irritable. Although he had infiltrated close to the enemy, he could not restrain himself and charged too early, attacking at the wrong time, causing the enemy to react collectively and withstand the ambush.

He even became the main general. He was hesitant and timid. Clearly, he had seized the timing for the sneak attack and had drawn close to the enemy, but he dared not go all-in, not attacking with full force at the crucial moment. By the time he wanted to give it his all, the enemy had stabilized their formation, and it was too late.

Sun Lingtong gained various insights.

“To succeed in a sneak attack, as a soldier one must hide one’s tracks, as a leader one must endure and hold back, and as a general one must have decisiveness! At the very moment of the ambush, you must go all out and commit everything. Only this way can the sneak attack achieve maximum effectiveness.”

It took a full two hours before Sun Lingtong slowly opened his eyes.

His divine sense was nearly exhausted. He put down the helmet, stood up again, raised his eyebrows at Ning Zhuo, looking proud, obviously having gained a lot.

“I have comprehended a battle formation called the ‘Light Breeze of Thieves Formation.’”

“This formation allows the soldiers to march quickly, as if treading on a light breeze. At the same time, it can conceal their tracks.”

“By hiding and disguising, after getting close to the enemy army, you then launch a fierce, full-scale ambush!”

“Like a gentle breeze brushing one’s face, it steals the enemy’s lives. It is especially adept at fighting after the enemy has fallen asleep!”

After Sun Lingtong finished sharing, Ning Zhuo became somewhat doubtful: “That’s it?”

He had thought he would see a lot of content, but in fact, there was only one battle formation.

Sun Lingtong stroked his chin and analyzed, “Gao Sheng’s Posthumous Writings are too fragmented and broken. It’s difficult to understand through normal reading.”

“My own knowledge of military strategy is basically zero, which only makes the situation worse.”

“As for the power of the generals-and-soldiers-shared-helmet, it allows the wearer to gain the experience of the soldiers and generals who once wore it.”

“Combining the two, based on my own nature and preferences, I can receive the correct guidance, thus summarizing a result that is most suitable for me.”

“It’s clear that my result is the Light Breeze of Thieves Formation.”

Ning Zhuo nodded repeatedly, expressing agreement.

Sun Lingtong’s outlook was broader than Ning Zhuo’s, especially in terms of practical experience.

Sun Lingtong’s thinking was also very meticulous. He deduced the truth after just one attempt.

“Little Zhuo, you give it a try,” Sun Lingtong suggested, “I’ve tested it for you, so there should be no risk.”

“Boss, thank you very much.” Ning Zhuo had long been interested. Before entering the camp, he imitated Sun Lingtong’s earlier state, sat cross-legged on the ground, and began to comprehend the military strategy.

He became a soldier escorting many civilians. Because of this burden, not only he himself, but the entire army was wiped out.

He became a small leader who refused to abandon wounded comrades. While dragging them to escape, he was overtaken and killed by the enemy.

He became the main general, who could not bear casualties and was unwilling to abandon certain troops. He continually committed the reserve units, and as a result, in the latter stages of the war, the front line, without any reserves, could not hold. Once a corner collapsed, the entire line quickly fell apart. Ning Zhuo, as the main general, also lost the battle and died.

Thus, Ning Zhuo comprehended a military strategy —the Law of Absolute Annihilation by Sacrificing Comrades in Death!

Once this method is employed, it can use the flesh and souls of one’s comrades as materials, all sacrificed to exchange for temporary power to strengthen those who remain.

Therefore, the more comrades die, the stronger the increase in combat power for those who survive.

Seeing Ning Zhuo’s weary expression as he opened his eyes, Sun Lingtong asked curiously, “Little Zhuo, what have you comprehended this time?”

Ning Zhuo: …

He was silent for a moment before saying, “I have comprehended a military strategy.”

Sun Lingtong pressed, “What strategy?”

“It must follow your character, according to your tastes, something that suits you best.”

Ning Zhuo: …

Boss, if you hadn’t said that, we’d still be good friends!

Seeing that Ning Zhuo remained silent for a long time, Sun Lingtong was driven by curiosity, “Aiya, Little Zhuo, hurry up and tell me.”

Ning Zhuo could only nod and reluctantly say, “This military strategy is called… The Hero's Return Technique!”

“What does that mean?” Sun Lingtong was puzzled.

Ning Zhuo recited softly, “As it is said, ‘The wind is bleak, the Yi River cold; once the hero leaves, he never returns.’”

“This military strategy allows the hero to return.”

“When comrades fight shoulder to shoulder, if a hero dies on the battlefield, the remainder of his strength will bless those who remain.”

“Though the hero may die, his remaining strength still assists his comrades in battle.”

“I really like this military strategy. It fully reflects my understanding of the cruelty of war. War is vicious and dangerous, and I love peace even more!”

“At the same time, this military strategy also aligns with my belief that any sacrifice must have value, and the higher the value, the more worthwhile the sacrifice.”

“Besides that, it also embodies my unyielding nature. Even in death, I must leave behind my remaining strength to continue fighting, showing persistence and courage!”

Sun Lingtong stared blankly at Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo held his head high, chest out, smiling at him with righteous dignity.

For a moment, Sun Lingtong was really fooled, muttering, “I just feel like something’s not quite right.”

Ning Zhuo quickly said, “Huh, why think about that? Let’s head back first.”

“Hm? Not continuing to comprehend it?” Sun Lingtong asked doubtfully.

Ning Zhuo shook his head, “On one hand, we’ve already been away for a long time. Mu Lan’s side might have sudden changes. Staying guard is safer.”

“On the other hand, since using Gao Sheng’s Posthumous Writings and the generals-and-soldiers-shared-helmet stems from our nature and preferences… of course, this claim still needs discussion.”

Ning Zhuo quickly added a sentence, then continued, “Then, we must truly grasp a battle formation or a military strategy before we can better comprehend the second one, right?”

“If we can’t fully digest it, the things we trigger will still contain much of the same content.”

Sun Lingtong nodded, “Makes sense, makes sense. As expected of Little Zhuo.”

Ning Zhuo smiled, “Of course, this is just a guess. But verifying it is very simple. We just need you, Boss, to comprehend it again.”

Sun Lingtong nodded, “Of course I’m going to do that.”

Immediately, Sun Lingtong remained inside the mechanical Dragon. Ning Zhuo, with the Dragon coiled around his waist, returned to the Three Generals Camp.

Upon receiving the news, Liu Er immediately came out of his tent to greet him.

Seeing Ning Zhuo’s face full of smiles, Liu Er’s own smile grew even warmer, “Seeing the military advisor as if bathed in a spring breeze, this trip must have brought great gains.”

Ning Zhuo clasped his hands in salute, “My family has given me greater authority, and now I can provide more support to the Three Generals Camp.”

Liu Er happily clapped his hands, “Indeed, that’s good news! Military advisor, hurry inside my tent and have a seat.”
