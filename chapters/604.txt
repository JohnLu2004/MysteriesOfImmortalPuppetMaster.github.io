Chapter 604: The Scripture of Myriad Manifestations

Qing Chi’s heart was suddenly struck at its sorest point. Her cheeks flushed red with anger as she whipped around to face the speaker.

She saw a tall, broad-shouldered figure wearing a conical hat and draped in silver-gray scale armor, holding a long-handled trident.

Qing Chi, small in stature, had only to tilt her head to see the speaker’s face beneath the hat.

And at first glance, she froze - beneath the brim wasn’t a human face, but that of a carp.

More precisely, it was a carp with a pair of silver dragon horns curling from its brow - clearly a demon of carp lineage with dragon blood.

Seeing her glare, the carp-headed creature grew visibly nervous and waved his hands in protest. “D-Did I guess wrong?”

Qing Chi clenched her teeth, refusing to confirm it. Instead, she grew more furious and demanded, “Who are you?”

The gray-scaled carp demon quickly replied, “I - I’m Li Xiangshang! Sent here by my lord, the Dragon Sovereign.”

Qing Chi’s heart gave a jolt.

In the Underworld, a sovereign was called a Fujun. In the mortal realm, a ruler was styled as a king. But the title Dragon Sovereign was reserved for overlords of the aquatic realms - noble and powerful beyond compare. Only cultivators of great might could hold such a post.

Qing Chi suppressed her anger. “And which Dragon Sovereign is your lord?”

Li Xiangshang immediately broke into an expression of heartfelt reverence. “My lord is the one known as the White-Haired Dragon Sovereign, who rules over - ”

“I know. Half of the Cang River, right?” Qing Chi cut him off impatiently.

Li Xiangshang gave a startled “Ah!” Though interrupted, he didn’t take offense. He scratched the back of his head sheepishly. “You already know? That makes things easier.”

Despite being a Golden Core cultivator, he spoke humbly to Qing Chi, who was only at Foundation Establishment, his manner deferential and nervous, his whole bearing rather inexperienced.

Qing Chi’s anger began to fade. She looked him up and down and felt a suspicion rising in her heart - along with a touch of amusement.

She asked, “Your Dragon Sovereign already sent Jin Yangzi once, and now he’s sent you. Is this still about taking control of the Golden Swallow Trident?”

Qing Chi, deeply concerned about Jiao Ma, had gathered a great deal of intel on Vigorous Yang Manor.

Recently, the manor had set up a Spirit Contract Treasure Refining Formation to refine its treasures. Yet after two assassination attempts, both of which killed important consorts, the situation had grown volatile. An insider had deliberately leaked the news, stirring up chaos across the entire city.

Qing Chi was well aware of this, and she knew Jin Yangzi had been the strongest candidate to seize the Golden Swallow Trident - until he was assassinated by that same traitor.

Jin Yangzi had hailed from the Seven Feathers Alliance, but it was under the White-Haired Dragon Sovereign’s orders that he came to Whitepaper Immortal City.

Now that Li Xiangshang had arrived as well, she naturally assumed he had also been sent to compete for the Trident’s control.

This filled Qing Chi with genuine delight.

After all, she was deeply worried that her beloved, Jiao Ma, might stand out due to his cultivation method and become the new master of the Golden Swallow Trident - thereby confirming his status as one of the City Lord’s male consorts.

If Li Xiangshang took the Trident instead, that potential path for Jiao Ma would be cut off. That, in Qing Chi’s view, would be a blessing.

But Li Xiangshang shook his head. “I’m a carp turning into a flood dragon. I cultivate the Ascending Dragon Transformation, a technique bestowed by my lord. Even though I’m male, my nature is water-aligned - it’s not compatible with the Golden Swallow Trident’s essence.”

“But little miss, you’re half right.”

“This time, I’ve come bearing a precious treasure, to find someone worthy - someone I can help to take hold of the Trident.”

“Your beloved, does he want the Golden Swallow Trident or not? This is a fortune few could dream of. I could help him seize it.”

Qing Chi’s brow furrowed, and she rolled up her sleeves. “You shameless beast - how dare you!”

Startled, Li Xiangshang leapt back several steps. “Hey, hey! No fighting, little miss! Fighting is forbidden within the city walls!”

“Then I’ll make an exception for you, you out-of-town pest!” Qing Chi sneered. Her fists flared with flame as she lunged forward with a punch.

Her fist struck Li Xiangshang square in the chest with a muffled thud.

Azure flames flared, scorching his silver-grey scaled armor - but they died out almost instantly.

Li Xiangshang’s aura surged, spiritual power coursing through his body. He stood unharmed, not even a scratch on him.

Qing Chi’s eyes narrowed.

She was startled by Li Xiangshang’s strength.

An ordinary Golden Core cultivator couldn’t have taken that punch so easily.

But more importantly, she noticed that he was circulating his cultivation technique within the city - without any suppression from the city’s grand formation. What did that mean?

It meant that before coming to Vigorous Yang Manor, Li Xiangshang must have already met with the higher-ups of White Paper Immortal City. He had their approval. He was recognized as an ally of the city!

Qing Chi’s heart sank. “Not good. The Lord of White Paper City must have struck some sort of deal with the White-Haired Dragon Sovereign. The Dragon Sovereign is making his move.”

Though she was fiery in both figure and temperament, Qing Chi knew when to yield. She immediately withdrew her hand.

“I’m warning you seriously. Stay away from my Jiao Ma. I don’t want him getting anywhere near that Golden Swallow Trident. He’s mine! I’m taking him out of Vigorous Yang Manor myself.”

Li Xiangshang blinked, scratching the back of his smooth bald head. “Oh, I see.”

He seemed to have a sudden realization, then waved his hand apologetically. “That was my mistake.”

“I promise - I won’t help your man.”

“But if he wins the Golden Swallow Trident on his own merit, that’s none of my business.”

Qing Chi narrowed her eyes, carefully scrutinizing him. Seeing that his apology was sincere and that he hadn’t acted superior in the slightest, she snorted. “You’d better mean that.”

Li Xiangshang nodded repeatedly. “Of course, of course. I swear it.”

Then, to her surprise, he actually swore a venomous oath.

That made Qing Chi look at him with fresh curiosity. This Li Xiangshang seemed simple-minded, the kind of cultivator who rarely dealt with others and focused solely on cultivation.

There were plenty of people like that.

Especially among the sons of great clans or elite sects - sheltered from birth, given everything they needed to cultivate, they spent their early years in seclusion. Only once they had the power to protect themselves were they sent out into the world.

That was exactly the impression Li Xiangshang gave her now.

After swearing his oath, he looked earnestly at her. “There. Feel better now, little girl?”

Qing Chi’s tone softened slightly. “Little girl? Who are you calling little girl? I have a name. It’s Qing Chi.”

Li Xiangshang blinked. “Huh? But you’re way younger than me. I’m probably older than your grandfather. Isn’t it proper to call you ‘little girl’?”

Qing Chi rubbed her forehead. “Just call me Qing Chi, alright? And remember your oath.”

“Here’s some advice: when dealing with people, don’t go around calling them ‘little girl’ or ‘child’ - it’s easy to offend someone.”

Li Xiangshang’s eyes went wide, as if he’d just been taught some arcane truth. “Really?”

Qing Chi’s eyes sparkled. “Since I taught you something, how will you repay me?”

Li Xiangshang froze. “Uh…”

This time, Qing Chi waved her hand. “Since you’re here to visit Vigorous Yang Manor, why not bring me in with you? Consider it a thank-you.”

Li Xiangshang hesitated. “Is that… allowed?”

Qing Chi huffed impatiently. “Of course it is! Just bring me along. If anyone tries to stop me, you just glare at them.”

Li Xiangshang scratched his head, uneasy. “I’m not sure that’s a good idea… I just got here. I don’t want to offend anyone…”

Qing Chi said, “If you can’t glare at people, then just keep quiet. Stand there, don’t say a word, and stare at them with a blank face!”

Li Xiangshang thought it over. “I can do that.”

And so, Qing Chi followed Li Xiangshang into Vigorous Yang Manor.

The first thing Li Xiangshang did upon arriving in White Paper Immortal City was pay his respects to the Paper Avatar of the City Lord. His visit to Vigorous Yang Manor this time had already been cleared with the higher-ups.

Vigorous Yang Manor welcomed Li Xiangshang warmly - but their attitude toward Qing Chi was something else entirely.

Just as they moved to block her path, Li Xiangshang let out a quiet “Mm,” eyes sharp and unblinking as he looked their way.

The courtyard cultivators froze: ?!

Li Xiangshang: …

After a few beats of tense silence, the cultivators finally got the message.

“Oh, so the two of you are together! W-welcome, please come in.”

Qing Chi was overjoyed and followed Li Xiangshang deeper into the courtyard.

She’d been here before and knew the layout. Midway through, she split off from him.

Before leaving, she gave Li Xiangshang a firm pat on the arm. “Alright, I’m heading off now. You’re a decent guy, big fella. Next time I come around, I’ll count on you to show me the way again.”

Li Xiangshang grinned. “You’re the first friend I’ve made here, Miss Qing. If you ever need my help, just call.”

Vigorous Yang Manor cultivators nearby could only smile wryly.

Qing Chi made her way to Ning Zhuo’s residence. She took a moment to smooth her hair and clothes, then drew a deep breath, nerves plainly written on her face as she stepped up to his door.

“Jiao Ma, Jiao Ma, I’ve come to see you,” she called softly.

No answer.

Qing Chi bit her lip, then raised a knuckle and tapped gently on the door. “Jiao Ma, it’s me, it’s Qing Chi - your Qing Qing.”

Still no response.

She pressed her ear to the door and activated a sound-enhancing technique, but the room was completely silent.

Qing Chi’s expression darkened, her eyes narrowing. In their depths flickered a trace of blue flame.

She began pounding on the door, harder and harder.

Bang. Bang. Bang.

“Jiao Ma, open up!”

“Still trying to avoid me?”

“I’m blocking the damn door!”

“Open up already! You hear me?!”

“If you don’t open this door, I’m not leaving today!”

“You brat, you don’t even have the guts to face me? You bastard!”

Her voice grew louder and louder, emotions flaring, and soon she was kicking the door with full force.

A neighbor from next door finally couldn’t take it anymore. “Please stop yelling, girl. Jiao Ma’s not in there!”

Qing Chi shouted back, “Don’t you dare try to cover for him!”

Startled, the neighbor stammered, “No, really! He left early yesterday morning and never came back.”

Qing Chi blinked, and her rage melted into relief. So Jiao Ma wasn’t avoiding her on purpose after all.

She quickly asked where he’d gone, but the neighbor just shook his head repeatedly. “No idea. Sorry.”

Qing Chi clenched her teeth. She wasn’t about to let this go. She’d come all the way to Vigorous Yang Manor - there was no way she’d leave just like that. “I’m going to find someone higher up. I want answers!”

As for Ning Zhuo, he had already gone to seek out Wen Ruanyu.

Following his instructions, Sun Lingtong had successfully reached the seventh regiment of the Paper Soldier Army and located the formation set by Meng Yaoyin.

But to activate the array plate, one needed Myriad Manifestations energy.

That was the hurdle they’d run into. With no way forward, Sun Lingtong could only wait patiently for Ning Zhuo to bring good news.

Ning Zhuo had taken the initiative the day before. He left Vigorous Yang Manor and sought out Wen Ruanyu to formally ask for instruction.

“Previously, Senior Wen mentioned the possibility of joining the Myriad Manifestations Sect, and also spoke of the Flying Cloud Assembly. The more I think about it, the more I find myself drawn to the idea.”

“Recently, I learned that anyone who wishes to enter the Myriad Manifestations Sect must cultivate the Myriad Manifestations Scripture.”

“I wonder if Senior Wen might be willing to impart some of the scripture’s content to me in advance, so I may begin training early and increase my chances during the Flying Cloud Assembly?”

It was a perfectly reasonable request.

Wen Ruanyu, being the one who had first recommended him, would also gain merit from his successful recruitment.

Hearing Ning Zhuo’s earnest petition, he was quite pleased. “Myriad Manifestations Sect embraces all forms and accepts all streams. The introductory chapters of our sect’s foundational technique, the Myriad Manifestations Scripture, are not restricted in their transmission.”

“I’ll teach you the Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment sections right now.”

Ning Zhuo received the Myriad Manifestations Scripture without a hitch, but he didn’t return to Vigorous Yang Manor.

Instead, he went to the south gate of White Paper Immortal City and re-entered the giant Paper Figurine Statue. Only through the Interwoven Field Paths Lantern could he once again tap into Life Hanging by a Thread and contact Sun Lingtong.

“Boss, everything went smoothly. I’ve got the Myriad Manifestations Scripture,” Ning Zhuo announced with delight.

Sun Lingtong was overjoyed. “Little Zhuo, I knew you could do it!”

After committing the teachings to memory, he began to study them in earnest.

The Myriad Manifestations Scripture opened with a preface:

“In the beginning, before the world split into clear and turbid, there was the Primal One Qi of Hunyuan. Thus came the Scripture of Hunyuan.

The Hunyuan Qi gave rise to all things - this was the Myriad Manifestations. The Myriad Manifestations are the pivot of heaven and earth, the union of yin and yang…

I have seen stars fall into oceans, and thunder split to birth spring shoots. I have realized that the myriad manifestations are merely Qi shifting in form.

Thus I composed this scripture: to take the formless into the formed, and to find truth within illusion.”

As he delved into it, Sun Lingtong’s heart grew more and more elated.

“This Myriad Manifestations Scripture really lives up to being the core technique of a top-tier sect. Its vision is profound - far beyond most other manuals.”

“Cultivating this scripture produces Myriad Manifestations energy, a power that can simulate and replicate the force of any technique under heaven. It’s miraculous, and yet so straightforward - anyone can pick it up!”

After only a short period of study, Sun Lingtong had already grasped the core of both the Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment chapters.

Part of it was his exceptional talent; part of it was the scripture’s clarity and accessibility - it truly was easy to learn.

With his understanding solidified, Sun Lingtong immediately began cultivation.

His main practice was the Virgin Boy Technique, which focused on the Divine Sea and upper dantian. His Qi Sea and Essence Sea hadn’t yet been refined by any dedicated method. Conveniently, the Myriad Manifestations Scripture targeted the dantian within the Qi Sea, making him an ideal candidate.

As for Ning Zhuo, his Three Sects Supreme Arts already cultivated all three dantians. That made him incompatible with the Myriad Manifestations Scripture - even if he wanted to learn it, he couldn’t.

Still, because Sun Lingtong’s Virgin Boy Technique was quite refined, his Qi Sea and Essence Sea had already been subtly transformed by the Divine Sea. These changes made him ill-suited for the Myriad Manifestations Scripture as well.

To cultivate the scripture successfully, he would need to further adjust his foundation - making things far more difficult than for someone starting fresh.

Under ordinary circumstances, Sun Lingtong would never have considered it.

But this wasn’t just about a valuable artifact. It also involved his sworn brother Ning Zhuo.

Without hesitation, and with full focus, Sun Lingtong threw himself into cultivating the Myriad Manifestations Scripture.

In just two days, he succeeded in generating Myriad Manifestations energy.

Though it was only at the Qi Refining level, it was already enough for the array plate to recognize and respond.

Ultimately, Myriad Manifestations energy was just a key.

Sun Lingtong poured it into the plate - and at last, it activated!

A restrained and mysterious energy swept outward, blanketing the entire Paper Soldier Army.

The next moment, the paper soldiers began to rustle, stirring ever so slightly even though there was no wind.
