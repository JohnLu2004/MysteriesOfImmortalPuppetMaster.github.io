Chapter 93: Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng

This mechanical ape was only half the height of Yuan Dasheng, but its stature was incredibly robust and imposing.

Its entire body was colored in gold and crimson. Its fur was a deep blood red, and golden structures could be found peeking out from inside its body. The golden structures of varying lengths and thicknesses assembled and interlocked together, as if the mechanical ape was clad in a hollow suit of golden armor.

But upon closer inspection, it became clear that this was actually its skeletal structure exposing itself. Its forehead, brow ridges, and nose bridge were all made of gold.

The mechanical ape’s face closely resembled Yuan Dasheng.

Its eyes were like blood-red jade, and heavy shadows could be seen beneath its sunken eye sockets.

Ning Zhuo’s puppet body ran to the mechanical ape and looked it up and down before circling around it. A pair of tiny puppet hands stretched out, sometimes squeezing the mechanical ape’s thigh, sometimes tapping on its exposed golden bones.

“Unfortunately, this puppet body doesn’t have divine intent, so I can’t check out the insides.”

Ning Zhuo was disappointed, but his thirst for research grew more intense with each breath.

At this moment, a message arrived.

Golden Blood Battle Ape!

The battle ape’s flesh was constructed mainly from Vermilion Fire Glass, which was derived from Vermilion Flame Stone.

Its bones were vajra bones created from Immortal Spirit Wood and Scarlet Gold Profound Iron, and they were peerlessly tough.

The surface of the vajra bones were engraved with the complete incantation of the Vajra Body Protection Method, making the vajra bones themselves powerful defensive magic artifacts.

Each of the battle ape’s hands concealed eighteen types of martial arts runes, and within its head swirled a cloud of condensed immortal mist. Every droplet of immortal mist served as a thought, granting it the ability to think…

This was the first time since entering the palace that Ning Zhuo had received such a large and detailed message.

The information was incredibly rich, and for a while, Ning Zhuo’s puppet body simply stood in place, savoring it carefully.

“The main materials used to create this mechanical construct were Yuan Dasheng’s body and soul.

“It remembers nothing of the past, but because of its spirituality, some deeply ingrained instincts remain.”

What caught Ning Zhuo’s attention most was this line: contains 80% spirituality, capable of using the immortal talent Righteous Bone Golden Hardness!

“Spirituality...” Ning Zhuo clicked his tongue in awe.

Spirituality was no small matter.

According to cultivation knowledge, the treasures used by a cultivator fall into several categories: talisman treasures, magic artifacts, magic treasures, and spirit treasures.

What made spirit treasures so special was the fact that they possessed spirituality.

Some spirit treasures in larger sects and clans were so intelligent that they could communicate normally with regular people.

“The Lava Immortal Palace can actually create a mechanical construct that possesses spirituality!

“Doesn’t that mean it can mass-produce spirit treasure?

“Three Schools Supreme Sage truly lives up to the name of a Void Refining stage powerhouse.

“But... only 80% spirituality? Why not a full 100%?

“What would happen if it were 100%?

“How can spirituality be increased?”

The more Ning Zhuo thought, the more questions filled his mind.

But his contemplation bore fruit.

He understood the reason why Three Schools Supreme Sage had set all this up in the room behind the Buddha door.

A mechanical construct imbued with spirituality was clearly meant to be used in conjunction with the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Incantation.

This Buddhist technique was a Spirit Refining technique that allowed the cultivator to construct a mirror of divine intent in the upper dantian and communicate with all spiritual things.

And now, wasn’t the Golden Blood Battle Ape in front of Ning Zhuo the perfect target?

With that thought, Ning Zhuo activated the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Incantation.

Although he was in a puppet body that lacked an upper dantian, the Life-Hanging Thread was still connected to his fleshly body and allowed him to access his divine sea and summon the divine intent mirror.

Soon, he established a connection between the divine intent mirror and the Golden Blood Battle Ape mechanical construct.

“Forward, backward, move left, turn right.” Ning Zhuo gave commands in his mind, and the Golden Blood Battle Ape executed each one precisely.

“Roll over, stick out your tongue, stick out your butt...” Ning Zhuo began issuing more complicated commands.

The mechanical battle ape obeyed, but also transmitted some annoyance.

Ning Zhuo was both amazed and thrilled. “Having spirituality really makes a difference. It can even throw a little tantrum.”

He continued attempting to communicate with the Golden Blood Battle Ape. While it couldn’t speak, it was able to transmit emotions and some basic responses.

The most frequent response was this: “Master, what do you need me to do? Please give the order.”

Although Yuan Dasheng’s corpse was its main material, it only had spirituality and no memories. And even if it did had memories, Yuan Dasheng had died without ever knowing that Ning Zhuo was the one plotting against it.

The more Ning Zhuo experimented, the more excited he became. He discovered that the Golden Blood Battle Ape could carry out relatively complex commands.

Normally, even with a heart seal, a mechanical construct had to be controlled constantly to move.

But the Golden Blood Battle Ape was practically equivalent to a cultivator. Once Ning Zhuo issued a command, he didn’t need to worry. It would execute it on its own.

“Marvelous, truly marvelous!”

Ning Zhuo, with the Golden Blood Battle Ape in tow, formally opened the door and stepped into Buddha Room 2.

The moment he entered, a cage fell.

Ning Zhuo tried to dodge, but the surrounding space was sealed. He could only let himself be trapped within.

On the other hand, the Golden Blood Battle Ape was unaffected and still remained free.

At that moment, a message arrived: Control the Golden Blood Battle Ape to protect yourself and repel six waves of invading puppets.

In the darkness, over a dozen pairs of eyes lit up.

Then, nearly ten mechanical wolves charged out.

The wolf pack rushed toward Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo instantly understood and gave a command to the Golden Blood Battle Ape.

The Golden Blood Battle Ape stepped forward to fight. Its movements were agile, displaying stunning martial prowess as it repeatedly ripped apart the mechanical wolves in close combat.

Ning Zhuo didn’t need to personally make a move. The Golden Blood Battle Ape tore through five waves of attacks all on its own.

In the final wave, thirty kung fu puppets appeared.

The Golden Blood Battle Ape began to struggle under the overwhelming numbers, so Ning Zhuo used the mirror platform to cast a spell.

Under Ning Zhuo’s guidance, the spirit energy stored inside the Golden Blood Battle Ape was consumed rapidly. Both of the ape’s hands were wrapped in a gentle breeze that greatly increased its speed. They were also infused with a chilly aura that allowed the ape to freeze its enemies.

As soon as Ning Zhuo made a move, the situation was instantly reversed. The Golden Blood Battle Ape instantly gained the upper hand and ended up winning easily.

“Logically speaking, this level shouldn’t be any less difficult than the rooms behind the Dao door and Demon door. But I didn’t find it hard at all.

“Is it because the Golden Blood Battle Ape is just too high-quality?”

Ning Zhuo guess was correct.

He continued on, pushing open the next door. But in this third room, he found himself struggling again.

“My coordination with the Golden Blood Battle Ape still needs a lot of practice.

“This time I went through the Buddha door right away, so I don’t have any blood energy right now.

“The Lava Immortal Palace changes after every three rooms. I wonder what good things might appear on this Buddha route after passing this level.”

After probing the area a bit, Ning Zhuo made the rational choice to retreat.

He didn’t rush to the Demon door to absorb blood energy. Instead, he attempted to exit the immortal palace.

A message arrived, asking Ning Zhuo whether he wanted to leave the mechanical ape behind or take it with him.

Ning Zhuo tested both options and confirmed that he could indeed take the Golden Blood Battle Ape in and out freely.

What surprised him even more was that even if he left the Golden Blood Battle Ape inside the immortal palace, he could still observe its status and give it commands through the divine intent mirror.

“Doesn’t that mean that I can…”

…

A short while later.

Meng Chong’s puppet body made it through Room 2.

“I trained endlessly without rest. Room 2 can no longer delay me at all!

“Hahaha!” Laughing loudly, Meng Chong pushed the door open and entered Room 3 once more.

Inside Room 3, numerous puppets immediately swarmed him.

“Ferocious Rushing Thunder!” Meng Chong activated his immortal talent. His body was like lightning as he weaved effortlessly through the kung fu puppets.

His speed shifted as he moved, and when he surged forward again after slowing down, the speed of Ferocious Rushing Thunder actually exceeded his previous limit.

Meng Chong’s control over his immortal talent had reached a whole new level.

Soon, he had knocked down all the kung fu puppets and was about to push open the door. But at that moment, the Golden Blood Battle Ape was activated by Ning Zhuo and revealed itself.

“Oh? There’s still a fish that slipped the net?” Meng Chong cracked his knuckles and charged forward.

Thud.

The next moment, the Golden Blood Battle Ape threw him over its shoulder and slammed him hard to the ground.

Meng Chong was stunned for a second, then stood back up and growled fiercely, “Again! I’m going to blast you to pieces!”
