Chapter 579: Surging Advancement!

Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged, eyes gently closed, fully immersed in cultivation.

He had now advanced to the third stage of Foundation Establishment: Dantian Birthing Radiance.

Among his three dantians and three supreme techniques, he first cultivated his lower dantian’s Essence Sea using the Demonic Blood Vein Technique!

Vital blood surged vigorously, flowing unceasingly within his lower dantian, transforming into a vast pool of blood. Surrounding this crimson pool was land webbed with densely intertwined blood tendons like a colossal net.

Thanks to the explosive growth in his dantian’s space, the blood pool and the net were initially confined to their second-stage scale, occupying less than thirty percent of the available area.

As Ning Zhuo activated the Demonic Blood Vein Technique, the blood pool surged fiercely, rapidly expanding, with the blood net similarly stretching and covering the pool’s bed.

A deep sense of satisfaction blossomed in Ning Zhuo’s heart.

Previously, he'd been stalled at the Medicine Gathering Stage, his dantian reaching its limit and unable to advance his cultivation further, forcing him instead to resort to alternate methods of accumulation.

Now, with a profound qualitative breakthrough, his dantian surged in capacity, granting him ample space for progress.

The rate of improvement was remarkably rapid, the blood pool and net expanding visibly, yielding immediate results.

Yet, this swift progress came with intense hunger.

Sensing this, Ning Zhuo decisively halted his cultivation, realizing time had swiftly passed, a full incense stick’s duration vanishing in a blink.

Growling loudly, his stomach felt profoundly empty, yet his physical appearance remained unchanged.

"In the past, I'd be skin-and-bones by now," he mused, astonished. "My appearance is remarkably preserved."

He quickly understood it was due to the deeper foundation forged by his physical cultivation, bolstered by the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat.

The spirit foods from Hidden Yang Villa primarily benefited the soul rather than the body. His own supply was long exhausted, but thankfully, he had many medicinal pills at hand, swiftly consuming them to replenish his physical strength.

Temporarily setting aside the Demonic Blood Vein Technique, he shifted to cultivating the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.

Within his Qi Sea Dantian, the five-element hurricane pillars expanded dramatically, soaring once again from earth to sky.

The efficiency of this cultivation was multiple times greater than his blood technique!

"This is all due to my profound mastery of the Five Elements," he thought, gratified. "With such deep insights, cultivating this technique is naturally swift and effortless."

Finally, he turned his attention to the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique.

Mirror after mirror emerged rapidly, covering his entire upper dantian.

"Never have I encountered bottlenecks in cultivating this Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique. Its cultivation speed far exceeds even that of my middle and lower dantians," he pondered, amused. "Perhaps my true talents lie within the Buddhist Path, proving my fundamentally kind and righteous nature."

Meanwhile, Sun Lingtong was busy at the well's edge, employing his theft art.

He drew a stream from the surging Yin energy, channeling it entirely into the Yin-Yang One Qi Kettle.

The three-foot-tall kettle blazed fiercely, crafted from fiery gold and night-hued crystal. Two Flood Dragons, one violet and one azure, coiled around the pot, their heads meeting at the top, mouths slightly agape.

The violet dragon inhaled strongly, drawing in the Yin energy and cycling it within the pot.

Then, the violet dragon sealed its mouth, while the azure dragon opened its maw, exhaling waves of pure Yang energy.

"Excellent! Wonderful! Perfect!" Sun Lingtong danced with joy, repeating his praise thrice.

Attempting to direct the Yang energy back into the well, Sun Lingtong saw it quickly devoured by the overpowering Yin energy. Still, his housing token recorded his efforts, acknowledging his contribution.

"Ning Zhuo, Ning Zhuo! Great news!" Sun Lingtong hurried over excitedly during Ning Zhuo’s break.

Hearing the details, Ning Zhuo exclaimed, "Who would’ve imagined General Liu Er’s treasure, initially meant for Mu Lan, would become so crucial here!"

After brief contemplation, he instructed, "Don’t inject all the generated Yang energy into the Yin surge - only about ten percent. Keep the rest stored safely within the pot."

After another thoughtful pause, he added, "Also, make sure the Yang energy contains some impurities. It shouldn’t be too pure."

Sun Lingtong's eyes lit with understanding, "Got it!"

They had previously agreed not to stand out excessively. With internal and external threats looming over White Paper City, the large group of male consorts was undoubtedly mixed, harboring spies and potential threats.

Anyone openly aiding the White Paper City Lord's healing would surely become a target of the city's enemies. The destruction of the southern paper idol demonstrated clearly the depth of enemy infiltration.

Even though Ning Zhuo attracted attention due to Qing Yan’s favor, granting him the prime residence, this alone wasn’t substantial enough to incite immediate hostility.

Thus, Sun Lingtong converted Yin to Yang diligently while safeguarding Ning Zhuo, who continued to cultivate vigorously.

All three dantians were brimming with energy, yet further advancement remained possible.

As Ning Zhuo continued cultivating the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique, countless mirrors within his spirit sea began cracking slightly.

Sharp, icy pains accompanied the cracks, followed by faint glimmers escaping through the fractures.

"So this is the Dantian Birthing Radiance stage," Ning Zhuo realized profoundly.

The faint glow gradually brightened, lengthening bit by bit, seemingly alive as it stretched over an inch.

At this moment, the Spiritual Mirror surface could no longer withstand it, cracks spider webbing across its face before it shattered completely.

However, the inch-long radiant light did not dissipate. Instead, it hovered in place, making the area noticeably brighter compared to its surroundings.

With each mirror's collapse, the brilliance at the location intensified slightly.

Continuing to channel the Mirror Platform Spiritual Technique, Ning Zhuo formed another mirror anew. He persisted, repeatedly collapsing mirrors, each time producing an inch-sized cluster of brilliance.

"From inch to foot, and then yard upon yard, until the entire Spiritual Sea is illuminated magnificently."

"Once the radiance spills forth abundantly, the Dantian Birthing Radiance stage can be considered truly complete."

Understanding this clearly, Ning Zhuo began cultivating the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique and the Demonic Blood-Vein Technique.

Within his Qi Sea appeared a vibrant, multicolored glow, while in his Essence Sea arose a blood-red brilliance.

Having just begun, the radiant Qi and Essence measured merely over an inch.

"The Dantian Birthing Radiance stage is truly a long and challenging journey!"

This stage marked another painstaking effort, requiring cultivators to consistently accumulate and temper their three dantians.

Normally, this stage took approximately thirty years.

Cultivators who used supplementary techniques - such as consuming pills, absorbing spirit stones, or employing cultivation formations - could shorten this period.

However, Ning Zhuo practiced three top-tier cultivation techniques simultaneously, tripling the time required. This would extend his cultivation period to ninety years!

Yet, thanks to his efficiency in cultivating his Spiritual and Qi Seas, the total time required would inevitably be less than ninety years even without external assistance.

Unconcerned about calculating precisely, Ning Zhuo took out a National Power Brick.

These bricks, painstakingly accumulated from the Two Notes Kingdom, were precisely meant for this crucial moment.

As the National Power Brick rotated and shrank in Ning Zhuo's hand, the brilliance within his three dantians surged dramatically - from slightly over an inch directly to over a foot, then exceeding a yard, increasing a hundredfold instantly.

The first brick dissipated without regret. Ning Zhuo decisively took out a second brick.

Brick after brick, Ning Zhuo continued until radiant light overflowed from all three dantians.

Dantian Birthing Radiance - completely cultivated!

Ning Zhuo had saved at least fifty years of arduous effort, and since he used National Power Bricks, there wasn't the slightest instability in his foundation.

"All this comes from my past accumulation, simply manifesting today."

"Next is the Wondrous Visions Sowing Talismans stage."

Continuing forward with great vigor, Ning Zhuo advanced directly to the next stage.

Radiant lights overflowed from his three dantians. Within the Spiritual Sea, vague rune shadows began to emerge, as was the case in the Qi Sea, though the Essence Sea remained purely blood-red, unchanged.

The Wondrous Visions Sowing Talismans stage involved cultivating these peculiar rune patterns, gradually forming them into complete symbols.

Each primary cultivation technique only produced a single complete rune symbol, forming the core of the cultivator's signature technique!

This signature technique varied depending on the method cultivated.

Now, Ning Zhuo's advantage in cultivating three methods simultaneously became evident - others had only one signature technique, but he possessed three.

Most cultivators practiced ordinary or mid-tier methods, resulting in correspondingly ordinary signature techniques. Yet Ning Zhuo's were all exceptional, derived from the Spiritual Mirror, Five Elements Qi Regulation, and the Demonic Blood-Vein Technique.

"Strange!" Ning Zhuo was astonished.

As he formally entered the Wondrous Visions Sowing Talismans stage, his Spiritual Sea suddenly transformed, revealing a towering mirror platform.

The mirror platform gradually shrank, condensing into a complete rune symbol!

"Why?"

"Could it be that my mysterious innate talent is closely related to Buddhism?"

Ning Zhuo was bewildered.

In his Essence Sea, phenomena were minimal, just beginning, which was perfectly normal.

Within his Qi Sea, however, a swirling five-colored torrent occasionally twisted into a spiral, occasionally separated clearly. The rune seed was already halfway formed - an anomaly due to Ning Zhuo's profound mastery over the Five Elements.

Thus, the cultivation within his Qi Sea had already reached the mid-stage.

"But why did the Spiritual Mirror's signature rune in my Spiritual Sea complete itself so swiftly?"

Ning Zhuo found it unbelievable, yet the reality compelled him to accept it, filling him with doubt: "Am I truly destined for Buddhism?"

The unexpectedly completed Spiritual Sea cultivation left Ning Zhuo both stunned and joyful.

Unable to find an immediate reason, he quickly focused on comprehending the Five Elements Qi Regulation and the Demonic Blood-Vein Technique.

At this cultivation stage, the primary emphasis shifted towards comprehension.

Two days passed, during which Ning Zhuo made significant progress in understanding the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique, while progress in the Blood-Vein Technique was moderate.

A paper servant appeared once more, bringing information and guiding Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong toward the garden.

In the garden, the silver-robed steward appeared once again, declaring loudly to the gathered group, "You've been here for four or five days now. Today, I've summoned you to distribute cultivation methods."

"This is also part of our White Paper City's welfare. It concerns your further evaluation, so everyone better listen up!"

The steward’s sudden shout startled some into alertness.

Sun and Ning followed the crowd and soon reached the Scripture Repository. Guided by the silver-robed steward, they entered in an orderly fashion.

"Fetal Light Nether Fire Scripture" – Enables a cultivator to temper their Fetal Light soul and control Netherworld Ghost Fire.

"Hidden Arrow Soul-Slayer Spear" – Allows a cultivator to transform their spine into a spear bone, unleashing soul-piercing screams during attacks, devastating to ghosts and souls alike.

"Red Beauty Withered Bones Curse" – Accelerates physical decay, almost exclusively suitable for women.

"Ghost Embryo Concealing Art" – Allows cultivators (regardless of gender) to conceive and nurture a ghost embryo within.

"Soul Aroma Technique" – Enables cultivators to infuse their soul with a unique fragrance capable of penetrating deep into bones and souls.

...

Ning Zhuo had previously studied numerous texts on ghostly and soul techniques, thanks greatly to Tian Shuang, who provided many scriptures along with his personal cultivation insights.

Ning understood clearly: though the soul seemed unified, it comprised multiple distinct parts.

Typically, a complete soul was composed of three hun souls - Fetal Light, Refreshing Spirit, Hidden Essence - and seven po souls-Corpse Dog, Hidden Arrow, Sparrow Shade, Thief Swallower, Non-poisonous, Filth Remover, and Smelly Lung.

Unless extraordinarily gifted or practicing peculiar techniques, a soul would usually have no variations.

Upon self-inspection, Ning Zhuo noticed his soul possessed an extra axe-like soul artifact, created from cultivating a special technique.

Observing the choices of others, Sun and Ning exchanged puzzled looks.

"Why is everyone picking 'Ghost Embryo Concealing Art' and 'Soul Aroma Technique'?"

To Sun and Ning, these were undoubtedly the most useless techniques presented.

Curious about this anomaly, they soon discovered the reason.

It turned out that the Hidden Yang Manor was merely a recruitment ground. All the male consorts would soon face an evaluation. Passing this test meant they could remain, and the exceptional ones might advance to the Vigoros Yang Manor, Radiant Sun Court, or Yin-Yang Court.

The conditions in these three courts far surpassed the Hidden Yang Manor, providing better prospects for cultivators.

To enter Radiant Yang Court or Yin-Yang Court, cultivators needed to practice either "Soul Aroma Technique" or "Ghost Embryo Concealing Art."

Powerful practitioners could produce soul fragrances to please the White Paper City Lord, while the latter method allowed practitioners to harness Yin essence to bear ghostly offspring for the City Lord.

Naturally, these offspring weren't human but members of the ghost race!

Ning Zhuo had yet to thoroughly cultivate his Three Supreme Methods, so he lacked interest in these new techniques, merely pretending to select one.

Sun Lingtong was merely accompanying him and lacked the qualifications to choose a method.

Jiao Ma, wait a moment, I have something to discuss," called a familiar male consort from their village, Yang Weida.

"Weren't you taken away by Master Wen?" Ning asked.

"He dragged me around the outskirts of the city but found nothing. After returning, he just dumped me here to fend for myself!" Yang Weida replied bitterly.

"What do you want?" Ning Zhuo asked, eager to resume cultivating.

Yang Weida pulled Ning aside into a shadowy corner and whispered, "I noticed you didn't choose either of those two techniques, clearly aiming for the Vigoros Yang Manor. That's my goal as well!"

"Right now, I have an incredibly potent Virility Elixir - just a dab and you'll see instant results. Tempting, isn't it?"

"It's affordable, extremely reasonable - just this price..."
