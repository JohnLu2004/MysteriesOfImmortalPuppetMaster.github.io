Chapter 122: Clouds Gather

Mechanism Carriage.

Ning Zhuo gazed intently at the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng seated beside him.

Today's harvest from venturing out of the city was far beyond expectations.

First, Ning Zhuo showcased the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng to the outside world, demonstrating the results of his acquisition of Yuan Dasheng's corpse.

Although the materials for the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng did not use any part of Yuan Dasheng's remains, it didn't matter.

Ning Zhuo could easily explain that his initial mechanical creations were prototypes that required continuous improvement.

Only after obtaining mature mechanism blueprints would he use Yuan Dasheng's bones as the primary material.

Second, Ning Zhuo tested the combat effectiveness of the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng through actual combat, discovering many areas for improvement and optimization.

"The Tree Martial Ape Dasheng needs more positions for talisman inscriptions, just six are not enough to fully showcase Yuan Dasheng's martial prowess." On this point, Ning Zhuo had to admit he underestimated Yuan Dasheng!

The Tree Martial Ape had already constructed the most flexible bone structure, with each bone capable of movement due to the splicing method.

Thus, from the foundational design, it allowed Yuan Dasheng to fully and freely perform various actions.

However, in actual combat, many of Yuan Dasheng's martial techniques required other components to fully unleash their power.

The design blueprint for the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng lacked the layout for formations.

This was mainly because Ning Zhuo lacked the time, and the layout of formations was too complex and precise.

Ning Zhuo could only use a combination of talismans to fill the mechanism's power as much as possible to meet Yuan Dasheng's martial needs.

Third, Ning Zhuo discovered a way to enhance his control over Yuan Dasheng!

That was Yuan Er.

When Yuan Er was assassinated, Yuan Dasheng was about to move.

Under Ning Zhuo's command, it participated in the rescue.

This action fully aligned with its spirituality!

When Ning Zhuo gave the order, several sheets of parchment were lifted.

After Yuan Dasheng killed several assassins and drove the rest away, more than thirty sheets of parchment were lifted.

"As long as Yuan Er is assassinated a few more times, and I use the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng to save him a few times, won't this work?" Ning Zhuo thought at the time.

So, he deliberately let the remaining assassins go.

"If these assassins don't act, I can arrange a few assassination attempts myself." "Anyway, Yuan Er is hiding in the Monkey Head Gang's base, easy to find."

"This time, he was ambushed and assassinated, there must be a traitor within the gang. He will no longer trust these people and will hide in the deepest part of the gang's base, living in fear and barely surviving." "I didn't expect such a person to be quite valuable." "Hmm..."

"If rescuing Yuan Er from assassinations is not enough for me to fully control Yuan Dasheng, then how about digging up Yuan Yi's grave?" "Robbing the grave in front of the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng and then ordering it to stop should also align with its spirituality, right?" "Hmm..."

"Find some people to attack the Monkey Head Gang, let the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng see it, and then go to the rescue. After all, this was its foundation in life, maybe it will work." Inspired, Ning Zhuo thought of many methods.

He felt a surge of joy and couldn't help but reveal a pure smile.

"Actually, aligning with spirituality is quite simple." "As long as you find the real need."

The carriage drove from the Monkey Head Gang's base towards the Ning Family Territory.

"Maybe I should go directly to the Zheng Tomb? My uncle's house doesn't have a good place for mechanism making."

Ning Zhuo changed his route midway, but ended up being turned away at the Zheng Family.

The Zheng Family stated: The Zheng Family is currently entertaining distinguished guests, and it is inconvenient to receive visitors.

They hope Ning Zhuo can understand.

"Who could the distinguished guest be?" Ning Zhuo felt a bit disappointed and had to return home.

On the way, he made a detour to check on his small courtyard.

Since the last attack and explosion, his home had become a ruin.

However, reconstruction began that very day.

Now, looking at it, the foundation of the house was already built.

The house protection formation was several levels higher than before, and with the Ning Family's connections, it could directly connect with the Fire Persimmon Immortal City Grand Formation.

Ning Zhuo returned to the Ning Family Territory.

The family envoy had been waiting for him, asking him to return the items previously issued for his outing.

The most valuable among them was the Directional Pursuit Talisman.

Ning Zhuo sighed and returned everything.

Ning Xiaoren received the envoy's report, confirming the return of the life-saving items to the family treasury, and felt relieved.

He also received first-hand intelligence from the guards, feeling a bit conflicted.

"This Ning Zhuo is truly a mechanism prodigy!"

"The previous Mechanized Fire Monkey was already impressive, and now he has designed the combat mechanism Tree Martial Ape Dasheng, with extraordinary combat power!" "The stronger he is, the more he can help the Ning Family in the Three-Family Joint Test." "However... can Ning Xiaohui suppress him like this?" Ning Xiaoren, being from the main lineage, naturally favored Ning Xiaohui over Ning Zhuo from the branch lineage.

He thought for a moment and decided to send this news to Ning Xiaohui's grandmother.

Ning Xiaohui's grandmother was conducting secret training for Ning Xiaohui.

Ning Xiaohui's throat was still wrapped in layers of gauze, her eyes focused on the basin of ice water in front of her.

Her hands were plunged into the ice, and it had been a stick of incense's time!

The bone-chilling cold invaded her entire body through her hands.

At first, she shivered all over, her face covered in frost.

Then, her hands turned purple, her body numb from the cold.

But now, at the final moment, she felt a trace of warmth from her numb hands!

It was like a seed of life sprouting from the depths of absolute cold, from the ten-thousand-year ice.

Ning Xiaohui had a sudden enlightenment and immediately comprehended.

Her hands emitted a jade-like glow, absorbing all the frostbite and coldness in her body, transforming it into a vigorous vitality that fed back into her.

In the next moment, Ning Xiaohui was radiant, and all the injuries and coldness in her body were completely healed!

Even her damaged throat was restored to its original state.

"Grandmother, I succeeded!" Ning Xiaohui tore off the gauze around her neck and cheered with joy.

Her grandmother stood by, witnessing her granddaughter's breakthrough, feeling comforted and her eyes reddened: "Good, good, good, grandmother saw it, you are indeed my good granddaughter." "You should have comprehended the essence of the Frozen Fat Jade Hands now."

NIng Xiaohui carefully chose her words: "It's like a trace of life in the extreme cold, a change after reaching the limit." Her grandmother nodded and said slowly: "All things in heaven and earth have spirituality."

"A cultivator's talent is the innate spirituality. Spirituality is countless, and so is talent." "The reason grandmother made you put your hands in ice was to make you experience the vitality in the extreme cold through this bitter cultivation." "As the saying goes, heaven never seals off all exits! There is no absolute despair in the world, and in the most desperate situations, there is always a glimmer of hope." "This is the principle of the operation of heaven and earth, the truth we cultivators seek, and the meaning contained in the Frozen Fat Jade Hands." "Here is a message just sent by the young clan leader, take a look."

Ning Xiaohui glanced at it: "I didn't expect Ning Zhuo to be so talented. The previous Mechanized Fire Monkey was not his limit, and he quickly created another excellent mechanism ape." "But this is nothing." NIng Xiaohui's grandmother nodded: "Indeed."

"Xiaohui, now that you have initially mastered the Frozen Fat Jade Hands, your strength will advance by leaps and bounds." "Although you have switched to the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique, the water element in the Five Elements Magic Power can complement your talent." "Additionally, the earth element and wood element magic power are also good matches for the Frozen Fat Jade Hands."

"If you obtain the subsequent techniques of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique in the future, surpassing the limit of our clan's main technique, the Frozen Heart Technique, switching to it would be a better path for you." "Ning Zhuo cannot compare."

"Even if he has talent, our clan will not test it now." "Even if it is tested in the future, he will have no good way to develop his talent."

"For example, in your bitter cultivation this time, grandmother deliberately blocked the information. In fact, the essence of the Frozen Fat Jade Hands has long been recorded in the family classics." "If you had read it in advance, it would have been a huge obstacle to your true understanding through bitter cultivation." "Only by truly experiencing the vitality in the extreme cold can you further grasp your talent." "This is the heritage of the family!"

"Ning Zhuo's talent is obviously not common in our Ning Family bloodline. Without the guidance and support of the family's ancestors, he will surely take many detours in the future." "The future is yours, Xiaohui."

NIng Xiaohui nodded: "Not just the future, the present is also mine!"

"When I have mastered the Frozen Fat Jade Hands, I will return to the renovation team and show everyone the elegance of the Ning Family's main lineage!"

Accompanied by Wang Lan, Ning Zhuo entered Ning Ze's Talisman Crafting Room.

He looked around and sighed: "With some modifications, it can still be used." Wang Lan felt aggrieved but smiled: "Xiao Zhuo, as long as it helps you."

"Unfortunately, as a woman, I don't know much about the Mechanism Technique. Your uncle is much better in this regard." "If he were home, he would surely help you more." Wang Lan subtly reminded Ning Zhuo that his uncle was still imprisoned.

Ning Zhuo seemed not to notice.

He took out various mechanism manufacturing tools from his storage bag, cleared out some facilities in the Talisman Crafting Room, and temporarily transformed it into a simple mechanism workshop.

Wang Lan watched and participated in the entire process, feeling increasingly bitter and angry but had to endure it.

Ning Zhuo asked Wang Lan to leave, wanting to be alone, and began dismantling the Tree Martial Ape Dasheng.

The main modification was to increase the positions for talisman inscriptions.

After some hammering and chiseling, the number of talisman positions on Yuan Dasheng increased from six to ten.

"Next, I need to refine various talisman scripts and adjust their combinations to basically meet Yuan Dasheng's martial needs."
