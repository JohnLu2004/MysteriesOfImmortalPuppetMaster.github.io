Chapter 536: Ning Zhuo vs Tian Shuang

TL Note:
Tian Shuang aka. Bai Shuang aka. "White Ghost" has been renamed to "Heavenly Ghost" + "Tian Shuang".

Also, G.Z.R posted 2 chapterts today (this is the first one) but it will take a bit for me to translate the 2nd since i got stuff to do. might take a few hours.

“Tian Shuang, look at your appearance, you are so pitifully disheveled!”

“You really made me lose face.”

The earth ghost laughed while openly ridiculing and mocking the Heavenly Ghost.

Boom, boom, boom……

The offensive launched by the three generals Liu, Guan, and Zhang grew increasingly urgent and fierce.

Tian Shuang retreated again and again.

He had protective treasures and spells on him, but the three generals’ assault -bolstered by their military strength -repeatedly shook him, and eventually broke through his limits, causing a three-foot-long wound on Tian Shuang’s right arm.

From the wound, a large number of ice frost fragments continuously fell.

These fragments drifted and fell in the sky, glittering brilliantly.

Perhaps due to the pain, Tian Shuang finally, in that moment, suppressed the interference of countless Buddha thoughts in his divine sea, and with difficulty, summoned a magical treasure.

Magical treasure -the Ghost-Beating Lantern!

This was a magical treasure that was widely circulated and extremely classic among ghost cultivators.

Depending on each ghost cultivator’s inherent nature and the different ghosts captured, the Ghost-Beating Lantern would exhibit varying powers and effects.

The Ghost-Beating Lantern that Tian Shuang employed at this moment had imprisoned ice frost-type demons and specters.

He held the lantern in one hand; the lantern spun rapidly, and the ice ghosts and frost souls inside continuously transformed, forming a series of images of icy prison confinements on the white paper surface of the lantern.

The brilliance emanating from the lantern shone near the three generals, immediately forming cages of icy light around them.

These cages carried powerful binding and interference forces, preventing the three generals from executing their techniques; after their various offensives broke through the icy prisons, their power was greatly diminished.

Because of this, Tian Shuang stabilized his position.

“Hehehe.” Di Hui let out a cold laugh, emerging from underground and standing on the surface.

He aimed from afar at the Iron Bucket Formation of the three generals’ camp, and with a swing of his sleeve, sent out bursts of ghastly green ghost-fire.

Spell -the Ghost Flame Scorching the World!

The ghost-fire burned silently and surged mightily, like waves of green tide, sweeping over the Iron Bucket Formation of the three generals’ camp.

Upon discovering the danger, the three generals immediately reduced the allocation of military strength, returning most of it to the soldiers to enhance their defenses.

When the ghost-fire collided with the Iron Bucket Formation, like tide hitting a reef, it immediately split and diverged to both sides.

Soon after, subsequent ghost-fire surged, submerging the entire Iron Bucket Formation.

“Hold on, buy time for the three generals!” Chen Zhi shouted, rallying the troops.

This grassroots talent, who had emerged in the selection for the Iron Skin and Meat Armor technique, upon receiving the appreciation of the three generals and some limited cultivation, immediately began to show his faint brilliance.

Although the ghost-fire was raging and perilous, the Iron Bucket Formation was defended as solid as a fortress, and just as the three generals heaved a sigh of relief, the earth ghost spat out a brown bone sphere.

The bone sphere extended and expanded in mid-air, and after a few breaths, transformed into a gigantic hollow door frame.

Within the door frame, a rapid vortex surged; the spiraling center was pitch black, and after rotating hundreds of times, it suddenly expanded -the Ghost Gate!

Within the door frame lay a gloomy, dark red underworld scene.

“You have many people, but I have more ghosts! Hahaha.”

Di Hui laughed heartily three times, and with a big wave of his hand.

In the underworld connected by the Ghost Gate, countless evil ghosts immediately emerged.

These evil ghosts, each one enveloped in flames, exuded overwhelming demonic energy. Some flames were bright red, while others were a deep purple-red.

Within the tongues and shadows of the flames, from time to time, twisted, wailing human faces appeared.

A humanoid lava skeleton supported the entire flame mass, causing the whole mass of flames to take on a vague human shape.

Inside the chest cavity of the skeleton, a fist-sized karmic fire core floated in mid-air, which was the true core.

“Fire Demonic Ghosts, burn them to death, kill them all!”

Countless Fire Demonic Ghosts surged out of the Ghost Gate in an unending stream, charging toward the ordinary soldiers of the three generals’ camp.

“Hold on!” Chen Zhi, feeling unprecedented pressure, turned ashen-faced and gritted his teeth to hold on.

The soldiers had already formed the Iron Bucket Formation, but under the onslaught of the Fire Demonic Ghost horde, casualties gradually mounted.

The earth ghost’s tactics were extremely ruthless; the strategy of “encircling Wei to save Zhao” took immediate effect, causing Liu, Guan, and Zhang -the three generals -to change expressions one after another.

Even though the three generals knew this was the enemy’s strategy, they had no choice but to fall into the trap and respond in kind.

The three generals’ cultivation levels were all at the Golden Core stage; only by relying on the battle array organized by a large number of soldiers -the collective military strength -could they counter enemies of the Nascent Soul stage.

Therefore, the vast number of soldiers in the three generals’ camp could not be lost.

“Want to leave?!” Tian Shuang roared harshly.

He had been suppressed for a long time by three mere Golden Core level opponents, finally came to his senses, caught his breath, and immediately felt extremely humiliated.

The three generals wanted to go back to salvage the dire situation, but how could Tian Shuang allow them, after having gained an advantage, to leave calmly?

Immediately, Tian Shuang counterattacked, forcefully contending with the Buddha thoughts in his divine sea, and still managed to temporarily stop the three generals.

“This is not good!” Seeing such a state of battle, Ning Zhuo immediately decided to continue joining the fight.

The situation in his mind was even worse than Tian Shuang’s, as Buddha thoughts almost completely filled it.

However, that did not prevent him from coming to save the three generals’ camp.

“My Buddha is above, heaven has the virtue of benevolence!”

“These ordinary people are also vibrant lives, worthy of being saved.”

Ning Zhuo immediately pulled out a talisman-level Somersault Cloud, sat cross-legged on it, and instantly flew above the three generals’ camp.

He looked down upon the battlefield and simultaneously cast the Five Elements spells.

In an instant, torrents surged, earth and stones flew, trees grew wildly, and golden light slashed in all directions!

Many Fire Demonic Ghosts were injured or destroyed by Ning Zhuo.

Once Ning Zhuo took action, he immediately alleviated the pressure on the three generals’ camp.

He then sent mechanical troops to charge in from the side into the horde of Fire Demonic Ghosts.

The mechanical puppets suffered heavy losses in large patches due to the collision with ghost-fire and demonic energy.

Military Strategy -the Hero's Return Technique!

Ning Zhuo continuously maintained this military strategy, and his strength kept rising as the mechanical puppets were destroyed.

Thanks to the use of the Fetal Breath Spirit Boat, his physical foundation advanced by leaps and bounds, and he could still benefit from this military strategy at this time.

Ning Zhuo was not passively defending; he commanded the mechanical troops to go against the current, fighting their way from the Fire Demonic Ghost horde all the way to the Ghost Gate.

Once the Ghost Gate was opened, it could not be moved.

This was an extremely important magical treasure for Di Hui; not wanting to suffer any losses, Di Hui immediately ceased its use, opened his mouth, and sucked the Ghost Gate back.

The bone-made Ghost Gate contracted in mid-air, shrinking into a bone sphere, and after falling into Di Hui’s mouth, was swallowed in one gulp.

Encouraged, Ning Zhuo continued to forcefully drive the mechanical troops to charge toward Di Hui.

After fighting all the way to this point, very few of his mechanical troops remained.

However, Di Hui did not take advantage of the mechanical troops’ weakness to counterattack Ning Zhuo; instead, he directly employed the Earth Escape Technique and burrowed underground.

Ning Zhuo’s eyes flashed.

He was very aware that a large number of Earth Walking Ghosts were active underground.

“Before the attack, the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth had already laid out the battlefield. This is something worth learning from.”

“Deep underground, there is very likely also a Ghost Gate!”

“Furthermore, Di Hui and Tian Shuang’s combat styles are extremely different.”

“It is often in fierce battles that one’s true character is most exposed.”

“Because it concerns life and death, and requires cultivators to make multiple crucial decisions in a short period of time. Therefore, the more such decisions one makes, the more one’s true nature is revealed.”

“There is a saying that confirms this: it is often not your friends, but your mortal enemies who know you best!”

“Many times, after a battle to the death, the understanding between enemies becomes very profound.”

“Although Ning Zhuo, Tian Shuang, and Di Hui had only met for the first time, through the recent encounter, their understanding of each other deepened significantly.”

“Tian Shuang favored head-on confrontation; even though he possessed Buddha thoughts, when faced with the pressure from the three generals, he never retreated but persisted in counterattacking.”

“Di Hui, on the other hand, primarily engaged in long-range attacks; once he was about to be engaged up close, he would retreat or vanish, then use spells or summoned ghost hordes to wear down the enemy.”

“Ning Zhuo found it troublesome.”

“Even if my mastery of the Five Elements was profound, it would be very difficult to restrain the earth ghost’s long-range retreat.”

“If I had a suitable magical treasure, perhaps I could resolve this predicament!”

Ning Zhuo once again discovered one of his weaknesses.

He thought for a moment, then took out many mechanical puppets, merging them into the remaining troops, supplementing their numbers considerably.

Subsequently, he took control of this mechanical army of over two hundred, and fought his way back to the three generals’ camp, serving as an external guerrilla force to provide temporary mutual defense and protection for the camp.

Ning Zhuo, himself, with one foot on the Somersault Cloud, ascended into the sky and launched an attack on Tian Shuang.

A round of Five Elements spell was directly hurled forth.

Tian Shuang wanted to dodge, but the many Buddha thoughts in his divine sea made him think, “I am so ferocious and dangerous, and harmful to the living, why should I continue to live?”

“Perhaps I should die here, setting an example for peace in the world!”

Thus, Tian Shuang not only did not dodge, but instead hovered in mid-air, spread his arms, and calmly welcomed the attack.

Ning Zhuo’s various spells directly plastered onto Tian Shuang’s face.

This scene directly left everyone dumbfounded.

The earth ghost even roared from underground: “Tian Shuang, what are you doing? Up to now, have the Buddha thoughts not dissipated?!”

Seizing this opportunity, Ning Zhuo transmitted a mental command to the three generals: “Quick! You all retreat to your camp positions!”

In just a short while, the Fire Demonic Ghost horde and the Earth Melting Ghost horde attacked simultaneously from above and below, and the mechanical troops that Ning Zhuo had just replenished were on the verge of near annihilation!

This showed the immense intensity of this fierce battle.

With Tian Shuang being tied down by Ning Zhuo, the three generals decisively descended and returned to the three generals’ camp.

Under the leadership of the three generals, the power of the Iron Bucket Formation greatly increased, immediately resolving the crisis at hand.

No matter how many Earth Walking Ghosts or Fire Demonic Ghosts attacked, with the three generals commanding the battle formation and constantly patching up any gaps, the formation was held as solid as a fortress.

However, when this scene fell before Zhu Xuanji’s eyes, it made him frown.

In his view, Liu, Guan, Zhang, and Ning had made a rather erroneous choice.

“They should concentrate their strength to deal with one of the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth.”

“The earth ghost is skilled at retreating; given the personality of the Heavenly Ghost, the Heavenly Ghost is the more suitable choice.”

“Only by severely injuring or repelling one of them would they have a chance to survive.”

“But they chose to split their forces.”

“Although it alleviated the immediate danger, it was akin to drinking poison to quench thirst, and was detrimental to the overall battle situation.”

“Ning Zhuo was indeed clever, but in this critical moment, he still lacked one layer of consideration.”

Zhu Xuanji, as he said this, couldn’t help but shake his head slightly.

The Red Sleeve Fairy beside him softly said, “Ning Zhuo is only sixteen years old, and to be able to perform at this level, trading blows with Tian Shuang and the earth ghost, is already extremely outstanding.”

“He’s only at the Foundation Establishment stage, and how many are there in the entire Southern Bean Kingdom?”

“Such a prodigious talent among the juniors should be worthy of more encouragement and praise; it seems that Lord Zhu has too many expectations of him.”

On the other side, Lin Bufan, with a thoughtful expression, said, “Ning Zhuo is protecting the three generals’ camp.”

“He invested a lot in the three generals’ camp; perhaps he still wanted to minimize his own losses.”

“Truly, like a young calf unafraid of a tiger, his courage is commendable! Even when facing the Twin ghosts of heaven and earth, he still harbored such thoughts.”

Lin Bufan was an experienced Nascent Soul cultivator, and he understood the reputation and strength of the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth far better than Ning Zhuo.

The Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth originated from the Soul-Devouring Sect, and were top experts at the Nascent Soul level. Paired up in twos, their cooperation was extremely tacit, and their past battle records were remarkably impressive, earning them fame throughout the nations.

Lin Bufan thought to himself that even if ten of him were combined, they would never be a match the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth!

Having said that, Lin Bufan looked toward Zhu Xuanji.

He was quite puzzled that although Zhu Xuanji had arrived, he was standing by with his arms folded.

“What exactly was the arrangement that Chief Detective Zhu mentioned?”

“His identity is too sensitive, making it difficult for him to take part personally.”

“Even if he did take part, although he possesses many divine abilities, can he really contend with the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth?”

Lin Bufan shook his head inwardly.

On the battlefield, Liu, Guan, and Zhang -the three generals -presided over the battle formation, fending off the continuous assault of the earth ghost, with no further signs of advancing.

Ning Zhuo and Tian Shuang engaged in a clash.

“The Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth are both demonic cultivators, with crimes overflowing; I should go all out to exterminate demons, to seek welfare for all living beings!” Ning Zhuo had already adapted to the Buddha thoughts in his mind; as long as he thought this way, these Buddha thoughts were even more potent than mirror thoughts.

With his foot on the Somersault Cloud, Ning Zhuo, bolstered by his full military strength and military strategy, unleashed various Five Elements spells in succession, creating a burst of colorful splendor, dazzling and radiant.

Tian Shuang, burdened by his demonic cultivator identity and having accumulated too many evil killings, simultaneously dispelled the Buddha thoughts and struggled to counterattack.

Ghost-Beating Lantern!

Ning Zhuo also suffered from the severe hindrance of the icy prison light.

Icy Crystal Ghosts!

He released ghost after ghost, which entangled Ning Zhuo. These ghosts, taking the form of flowing icy crystal mist, would freeze any target they touched, with various ice spines growing within, piercing through the internal organs. Then, clusters of ice crystals filled the entire internal space of the body.

“Unfortunately, my mechanical puppets cannot fly!”

Ning Zhuo once again discovered his own shortcoming.

“The Dark Night Tiger won’t do either.”

“Hmm? It seems that Yuan Dasheng can!”

A thought struck Ning Zhuo, and he immediately released the Heavy-Armored Blood Ape, Dasheng.

He had long equipped the latter with a Black Iron Cloud; this moving cloud was of a higher grade than the Somersault Cloud beneath Ning Zhuo’s feet, at the level of a magical treasure.

“My lord, your subordinate has arrived!” Heavy-Armored Blood Ape Dasheng, stepping on the Black Iron Cloud, guarded by Ning Zhuo’s side.

He resisted the icy crystal ghosts; his boxing and kicking skills were formidable, and in a short time, he smashed several of them.

Yet Ning Zhuo did not feel any reduction in pressure.

Because Tian Shuang had once again made his move.

He threw out a magical treasure in the shape of a pipa, entirely made of icy crystals. The pipa played by itself, emitting a series of mournful, ghostly wails.

The sound transmitted and permeated into Ning Zhuo’s body, causing his soul to immediately feel the chill, freezing him to shivering.

He swallowed medicinal pills and mobilized Five Elements spells to protect his body; although it had some effect, the continuous sound nevertheless drained a great deal of his energy.
