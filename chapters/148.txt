Chapter 148: The City Lord's Mansion Strikes with Full Force 

City Lord's Mansion.

"We pay our respects to Young Master Meng Chong!" Sixteen cultivators greeted in unison.

Their cultivation levels were uniform, all at the peak of the third layer of Qi Refining Stage, practicing the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.

Standing beside Meng Chong, Fei Si timely introduced, "Young Master Meng Chong, let me introduce them to you. Many of them were personally recruited by me."

"This is Li Duolun, skilled in using serrated wheels to attack and kill enemies. When designing new mechanical constructs, he likes to use interlocking wheels." Li Duolun stepped forward and cupped his hands towards Meng Chong, "I am willing to serve Young Master Meng Chong."

He was a tall, fat man with a kind face, reminiscent of a Buddha statue in a temple.

Fei Si continued, "This is Feng Feidao. His design of the flying knife sleeve crossbow is extremely exquisite, capable of shooting more than ten flying knives at once. Each flying knife can further split into four or five, forming an array in the air to slice the enemy into pieces." Meng Chong looked at Feng Feidao, who was a short man in a warrior's outfit, masked, with a pair of small, sharp eyes.

Feng Feidao knelt on one knee, expressing his loyalty to Meng Chong, "I am willing to go through fire and water for Young Master Meng Chong!"

Fei Si finally introduced, "This is Guan Tiesuo. His specialty is controlling a large number of magnetic lock mechanisms that climb onto the target, interlocking to form iron chains that completely bind the enemy, making it impossible for them to move."

Guan Tiesuo spoke in a deep voice, "I have met Young Master Meng Chong."

Li Duolun, Feng Feidao, and Guan Tiesuo were the most outstanding leaders in the City Lord's Mansion's Reformation Team.

Fei Si had put in considerable effort to recruit them.

Finding cultivators at the Qi Refining Stage with a certain level of mechanical construct expertise was not easy.

Mechanical constructs were difficult to learn and master.

Most Qi Refining Stage cultivators with the means would choose alchemy, artifact refining, or array formation.

Those without the means would opt for farming, fishing, or hunting.

Mechanical constructs were considered a niche skill in the myriad arts of cultivation, rarely chosen unless by chance or necessity.

"Good," Meng Chong nodded, "Next, we will explore the Immortal Palace together. It's simple, when I charge, you follow me." Meng Chong had no command ability.

Fei Si coughed twice, reminding, "While numbers bring strength, they also have drawbacks."

"According to our current knowledge, the difficulty of the Lava Immortal Palace's trials adjusts based on the number and strength of participants. With our large group, it's likely we will attract mechanical apes, increasing the trial's difficulty. It's even possible multiple mechanical apes will attack us simultaneously."

"If that happens, you must protect Young Master Meng Chong at all costs. Even if it means using your bodies, you must distract the mechanical apes to create opportunities for Young Master Meng Chong!" "Understood!" The Reformation Team responded in unison, resolute in their obedience.

The City Lord's Mansion had informants in all three families.

The intelligence about the Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng blocking the three families' geniuses in Room Two had already been obtained by the City Lord's Mansion.

Therefore, Fei Si attributed Yuan Dasheng's appearance to the Lava Immortal Palace's trial difficulty adjustment.

Meng Chong suddenly said, "Wait!"

"If that mechanical ape appears, none of you are to intervene. I will handle it personally. Do you understand?" The Reformation Team members exchanged glances, then looked at Fei Si.

Fei Si smiled slightly, "Since Young Master Meng Chong has said so, you should obey." "Yes," they responded again, but this time their voices were noticeably weaker.

Some exchanged glances, clearly skeptical of Meng Chong's decision to fight alone.

"Do you understand anything?" Fei Si thought disdainfully.

Meng Chong's decisions came from his heart, driven by his nature.

Each action allowed him to further unleash his nature and deepen his understanding of his immortal potential.

Since exploring the Immortal Palace, Meng Chong had repeatedly fought and improved significantly.

"And he is far ahead of the geniuses from the three families!" Fei Si, unaware of the truth, always believed Meng Chong was the first, holding a significant advantage.

Especially after Meng Chong recently shared the ranking information with Fei Si.

Fei Si asked some questions, including whether names could be changed, and was misled.

"Young Master Meng Chong has limitless potential. The City Lord's foresight is profound. At this rate, he will surely take control of the Lava Immortal Palace!"

"The only concern is Zhu Xuanji!"

"This person colludes with the three families, stirring up trouble, and enters the Immortal Palace under the guise of investigating the truth. Even Lord Meng Kui cannot openly stop him. It's quite troublesome..."

The righteous path follows the rules of the game.

Direct confrontation is the style of the demonic path.

Ning Family Territory.

In Ning Gui's cultivation chamber, Ning Zhuo was practicing almost manically.

He was surrounded by dense clouds, thick like cotton, enveloping him completely.

He lit incense to aid his spirit, meditated on the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique, his face serene and peaceful.

He tilted his head back, pouring exquisite spiritual food into his throat, swallowing large mouthfuls while practicing the Demonic Blood Vein Technique.

Sitting cross-legged on a mat, he actively circulated the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique, using the Ice Light Strong Pulse Talisman and Sharp Advancement Needle to boldly open new meridians.

While Zhong Chong, Zheng Jian, and Ning Xiaohui were stuck at the peak of the third layer of Qi Refining Stage, Ning Zhuo's Qi Refining cultivation had reached the late fifth layer, his essence cultivation had broken through to the sixth layer, and his spirit cultivation had advanced to the late sixth layer!

"Since understanding the embryonic form of the Life-Hanging Thread divine ability, each spirit cultivation session has been exceptionally effective, without any bottlenecks, smooth sailing. The Demonic Blood Vein Technique quickly broke through to the sixth layer, thanks to my relentless consumption of large amounts of spiritual food and various elixirs. Ironically, the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique, which I started with, has fallen behind, only at the late fifth layer. Even with the Ice Light Strong Pulse Talisman and Sharp Advancement Needle, it's the same."

"Unfortunately, to be safe, I can't use the Zhou Family's Gathering and Dispersing Wishful Spirit Stream Formation. Using that formation might push my magical power cultivation to the sixth layer." Ning Zhuo thought of the message from the Ning Family's upper echelon.

The Ning Family's ancestor personally decreed to heavily support the Ning Family's Reformation Team, providing more unique and excellent cultivation resources.

"Three bottles of White Snow Spring Elixir for the entire Reformation Team as a baseline. With such excellent healing elixirs, there's no fear of injuries from rapid cultivation. Two Insight Diagrams are also good. If I can comprehend the Proud Snow Technique or the Lingxiang Technique, these two techniques naturally align with the Five Elements Qi, requiring no modification. The most crucial is the Ice Heart Jade Pot!"

"This is the Ning Family's treasured artifact, capable of brewing Ice Heart Jade Liquid Wine, or Ice Jade Wine for short."

"After consuming this wine, it can use spirit treasures to enhance qi treasures, supplementing qi with spirit, making it the best cultivation resource for the Ice Heart Technique." The main lineage of the Ning Family all practiced the Ice Heart Technique.

This technique, when mastered, often led to calmness, even coldness, without any emotional fluctuations.

As the saying goes: "Frost like a knife, the ice heart grinds the mirror. Guard the heart like ice, no evil can invade."

The accumulation speed of the Ice Heart Technique's magical power was not as fast as most top-tier techniques, but its strength in spirit cultivation was unparalleled.

Relying on Ice Jade Wine could let spirit cultivation drive qi cultivation, perfectly compensating for the technique's flaw.

"Although I practice the Five Elements Qi, Ice Jade Wine is also very suitable for me." Ning Zhuo's spirit cultivation far surpassed his magical cultivation.

Drinking Ice Jade Wine could elevate his magical power.

Of course, the effect of Ice Jade Wine was best for those practicing the Ice Heart Technique.

The purpose of this spiritual wine was to compensate for the slow accumulation of magical power in Ice Heart Technique practitioners.

The same resource has different effects and values for different cultivators.

For this, Ning Zhuo felt fortunate.

If not for the four families competing over the Lava Immortal Palace, how could a marginal figure from a branch family like Ning Zhuo access the Ning Family's core cultivation resources?

Not to mention the Insight Diagrams, even the Ice Light Strong Pulse Talisman would be out of reach.

Now, Ning Zhuo only needed to perform the best to qualify for Ice Jade Wine!

Under normal circumstances, Ice Jade Wine was only sufficiently supplied to Golden Core ancestors.

All other main lineage members, including the family head, had to wait in line.

How could it be Ning Zhuo's turn?

"Hmm?" Ning Zhuo took a moment to observe the Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng.

Yuan Dasheng had been left in the Lava Immortal Palace, as before.

Through Yuan Dasheng's perspective, Ning Zhuo noticed the City Lord's Mansion's significant move.

Led by Meng Chong, the Reformation Team, with a total of seventeen members, entered the Immortal Palace together, marching with high morale.

"The City Lord's Mansion? What a grand gesture." Ning Zhuo was secretly amazed.

Currently, the three families combined could barely gather sixteen people.

The City Lord's Mansion alone brought out sixteen, showing their long preparation.

Meng Kui, such a wise strategist, indeed had deep plans.

"With the City Lord's Mansion so strong, no wonder the three families had to unite and grow increasingly cohesive." Ning Zhuo sighed while controlling the Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng to notify Sun Lingtong.

Sun Lingtong's soul was still in the Immortal Palace.

Being at the Foundation Establishment Stage, his soul was strong enough to last two or three days without issue.

Sun Lingtong was currently hiding in a preparation room, using various mechanical tools to modify himself.

Sun Lingtong's mechanical construct skills were also not low.

Ning Zhuo had shared his mother's mechanical construct books with Sun Lingtong when they were young.

Sun Lingtong, eager to reunite with his master, had always been diligent and serious in learning mechanical constructs.

He was naturally talented, with high comprehension ability.

Thus, Sun Lingtong's mechanical construct skills, though not as advanced as Ning Zhuo's, far exceeded the standard for entering the Immortal Palace.

Receiving the report from Da Sheng, Sun Lingtong was startled, "Someone's coming?" Then, he was delighted, "Good, good, good. Just as Little Zhuo said, let them in first."
