<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Without sparing a glance backward, Ning Zhuo turned and left decisively.<br/>
<br/>
The elderly steward watched Ning Zhuo's departing figure and felt an urge to rebuke him, yet the words choked back in his throat.<br/>
<br/>
"This pock-faced boy is odd indeed. Could he have someone backing him, making him fearless against us?"<br/>
<br/>
"Otherwise, how could he act so arrogantly?"<br/>
<br/>
Suspicion brewed deeply in the steward's heart. Feeling the depth of the waters here, he decided to swallow his grievance for now and carefully investigate Ning Zhuo's background first.<br/>
<br/>
When Ning Zhuo returned to his seat in the dining hall, he instantly drew the attention of those around.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong continued crouching inconspicuously in the corner, quietly eating his meal. Ning Zhuo’s departure and return had been closely monitored by him. Should anything unusual arise, he'd leap out immediately.<br/>
<br/>
Upon sitting down, Ning Zhuo found himself quickly captivated by the spirit dishes placed before him.<br/>
<br/>
First was the Cinnabar Soul Jelly.<br/>
<br/>
It was a translucent, crimson square dessert, its surface shimmering with numerous mysterious runes, reminiscent of the Yin-Nourishing Scripture.<br/>
<br/>
Taking his first bite, Ning Zhuo initially felt nothing. Yet soon after, sourness, sweetness, bitterness, and spiciness surged forth simultaneously, twisting his expression as the overwhelming assault on his senses became nearly unbearable.<br/>
<br/>
But the sensations vanished almost as swiftly as they'd arrived, like a fleeting life, emotions scattering swiftly in wind and rain.<br/>
<br/>
A lingering melancholy overcame Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Next came the Wheel of Reincarnation Black Algae Rolls.<br/>
<br/>
These were made from sheets of dry yellow tofu skin wrapped around black algae harvested from the Netherworld River.<br/>
<br/>
Nibbling slightly, Ning Zhuo grimaced instantly. The tofu skin was bland and papery, akin to biting into layer upon layer of charm paper. The algae itself was unbearably salty, nearly causing him to spit out his own tongue in disgust.<br/>
<br/>
Then there was the Branding Iron Rib Steak.<br/>
<br/>
Blackened to the point of resembling iron, the rib bone felt heavy in Ning Zhuo’s grip, and he immediately experienced a sharp stabbing pain within his soul.<br/>
<br/>
Forcing himself, he bit down with difficulty. The meat was stubbornly tough, requiring immense effort merely to tear off a few pieces.<br/>
<br/>
As he chewed, a powerful burning sensation quickly spread, tormenting him from within.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the main dish was a basin of Tongue-Pulling Sliced Noodles.<br/>
<br/>
These tongues were disturbingly fresh, wriggling restlessly inside the basin - some leaping, others licking or curling in protest.<br/>
<br/>
When Ning Zhuo tried one slice, it struggled furiously within his mouth, resisting being eaten. After finally managing to chew, an overwhelmingly sour sauce erupted forth, assaulting his palate so aggressively that he thought his teeth might dissolve.<br/>
<br/>
After just one slice, Ning Zhuo found it nearly impossible to continue. The sharp acidity had invaded every corner of his mouth.<br/>
<br/>
This lunch provided by the Hidden Sun Villa was truly beyond description.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was comparatively fortunate. Many others who had just arrived embarrassed themselves spectacularly, drawing jeers from the watching male consorts who relished the newcomers' discomfort.<br/>
<br/>
"Hahaha, rookies, you have much to learn."<br/>
<br/>
"You can't even handle eating a meal; what else are you good for?"<br/>
<br/>
"You might as well crawl back home now, save yourselves some embarrassment!"<br/>
<br/>
Frustrated, some newcomers tried using their energy to suppress the rebellious spirit food in their mouths. However, they were swiftly discovered and whipped by nearby paper servants.<br/>
<br/>
The paper servants harshly reprimanded, "These spirit delicacies were meticulously crafted by our City Lord’s Manor at great expense and effort!"<br/>
<br/>
"Using your energy carelessly will taint these dishes and cause a tremendous waste."<br/>
<br/>
"If you can't even finish a meal, better get lost now!"<br/>
<br/>
The reprimanded cultivators flushed red, quietly enduring the humiliation without daring to further employ their techniques.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, determined and persistent, continued chewing diligently, swallowing mouthful after difficult mouthful.<br/>
<br/>
His motivation was clear - though these dishes tasted dreadful and were challenging to consume, their effects were remarkable.<br/>
<br/>
By the time Ning Zhuo had finished the meal, he was delighted to discover that the foundation of his soul had surged impressively, reaching a strength two hundred and twenty times that of an ordinary person's.<br/>
<br/>
"One meal gave me such substantial growth!"<br/>
<br/>
"If I stay here for some time, merely eating meals could push my soul foundation past the thousand-fold mark!"<br/>
<br/>
After lunch, most of the veteran male consorts departed the dining hall, leaving only Ning Zhuo and the other newcomers behind.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, Sun Lingtong emerged quietly from his corner, transmitting a message discreetly with his divine sense, "I just spoke with other ghost-servants here. They mentioned that when their masters first arrived, they generously bribed the elderly steward."<br/>
<br/>
"For newcomers like us, the sort of living arrangements we get assigned now could be absolutely crucial."<br/>
<br/>
“Perhaps we could imitate them and strive for a large residence ourselves?”<br/>
<br/>
The male consorts were mostly humans, with very few ghosts among them, creating a distinct division between newcomers and veterans. The atmosphere wasn't exactly welcoming. However, the ghost clansmen themselves got along famously, often enthusiastic in assisting and advising each other.<br/>
<br/>
“I have some news as well…” Ning Zhuo concisely summarized his recent conflict with the elderly steward to Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong became curious. “Little Zhuo, knowing your character and your usual saying about small sacrifices for greater ambitions, why would you be so protective of your money this time and avoid bribery? You must have another plan, right?”<br/>
<br/>
“You truly understand me, boss,” Ning Zhuo praised.<br/>
<br/>
Then, slowly and clearly, he explained his rationale: “White Paper Immortal City is currently troubled both internally and externally. Since our identities are disguised, exposure would lead to severe complications. Being mistaken for undercover agents from the City Overthrow Alliance would spell disaster.”<br/>
<br/>
“Our top priority right now is to gather information.”<br/>
<br/>
“The second priority is to remain inconspicuous and not attract undue attention.”<br/>
<br/>
“As for bribery, we’ll wait for the right opportunity.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong quickly grasped Ning Zhuo’s logic. “You're saying there's likely someone from the City Overthrow Alliance hidden among the male consorts?”<br/>
<br/>
“Precisely.”<br/>
<br/>
“The City Lord of White Paper City needs Yang energy to cultivate. Her condition is critical to the city's survival against this ghost tide, a fact that's undoubtedly not lost on the City Overthrow Alliance. They would certainly infiltrate the ranks of the consorts.”<br/>
<br/>
“So, we must remain low-profile and act ordinarily,” Ning Zhuo nodded in agreement. “If we can deduce this much, surely the upper echelons of White Paper City have anticipated the same.”<br/>
<br/>
“What’s suspicious, however, is how we became consorts with practically no vetting.”<br/>
<br/>
“This might be a deliberate setup by the City Lord. Under such uncertain conditions, it's safer to watch quietly from the sidelines.”<br/>
<br/>
Having reached an understanding, the two dropped their concerns about securing a better residence.<br/>
<br/>
“Follow me closely, I'll show you around. Remember the paths clearly - don't wander and cause trouble. If you do, you’ll bear the consequences!”<br/>
<br/>
Two White Paper attendants approached the group, sternly cautioning everyone before leading them out of the dining hall for a tour.<br/>
<br/>
The Hidden Yang Residence boasted extensive facilities: the Paper Puppet Martial Grounds, Underworld Kitchen, Dining Hall, Soul-Cleansing Bathhouse, Quiet Mind Pavilion, Scripture Library, Garden of Abstinence, and Yang-Sealing Shadow Wall - everything a male consort could require for cultivation, daily living, and social activities was well-covered.<br/>
<br/>
The tour wasn't superficial; each location was explored thoroughly, with everyone encouraged to practice until proficient.<br/>
<br/>
By the time the inspection concluded, evening had fallen.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo and the others returned to the dining hall for dinner. The evening meal tasted worse than lunch, yet upon consuming it, Ning Zhuo found his soul essence improved by around thirty individuals’ worth - slightly better than the noon effect.<br/>
<br/>
After most had dispersed, leaving only the newcomers in the hall, the elderly steward returned unexpectedly.<br/>
<br/>
“Residence A-01: - Jiao Ma!” declared the elder, astonishingly assigning the finest accommodation directly to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong exchanged shocked looks: ?!<br/>
