“Who exactly are you?”<br/>
<br/>
Facing the stern questioning of the White Paper City Lord’s avatar, Ning Zhuo’s heart tightened. In that moment, he understood - his disguise had been seen through.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had been impersonating Jiao Ma, using a theft technique devised by Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Although Sun Lingtong was only at the Foundation Establishment stage, and despite enhancing his theft techniques by absorbing an Evil God’s Bone marrow, even with such a boost, it was impossible to fully replicate the aura of a Nascent Soul cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
Just like Ning Zhuo himself - during the battles between Two Note Kingdom and Thousand Peaks Forest - even after exhausting his entire arsenal, he had still been unable to simulate the genuine might of a Nascent Soul stage.<br/>
<br/>
That he had managed to fool them until now only further proved the terrifying skill of Sun Lingtong’s theft arts.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo cupped his hands and gave a slight bow. “May I ask the City Lord to dismiss the others? I will explain everything in private.”<br/>
<br/>
Wen Ruanyu immediately furrowed her brow, about to object.<br/>
<br/>
Yet the paper avatar simply waved her sleeve: “You all leave.”<br/>
<br/>
“City Lord?!” Wen Ruanyu was visibly tense.<br/>
<br/>
The death of Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer had been White Paper Immortal City’s greatest loss, triggering the arrival of this avatar. Should this avatar also fall here, the city’s future would surely grow even darker.<br/>
<br/>
But the avatar simply fixed Ning Zhuo with a penetrating stare and repeated: “Leave.”<br/>
<br/>
None of the attendants dared to defy the City Lord’s will, and one by one they withdrew.<br/>
<br/>
With a wave of her long sleeve, the avatar sealed off the surroundings, forming a secret space for private conversation.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was slightly surprised - he hadn’t expected the avatar to be this accommodating.<br/>
<br/>
The White Paper City Lord’s avatar then produced a treasure: “This is the Heart-Piercing Scroll. It can distinguish truth from lies. Should you lie, your heart will be torn apart, and you will die on the spot.”<br/>
<br/>
With that, she activated the treasure, causing it to hover above Ning Zhuo’s head.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately, Ning Zhuo felt his life force forcibly linked to the Heart-Piercing Scroll.<br/>
<br/>
“Little Zhuo!” Sun Lingtong’s voice cried out in alarm, wishing he could take his place.<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zhuo sent a calm transmission: “Boss, don’t forget - I have the Fire Heart Temple.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong shook his head - he knew Ning Zhuo was merely offering comfort. Though Ning Zhuo’s heart had been refined and fused with a ten-thousand-year fire essence, in the end it was only a Foundation Establishment level heart, upgraded at best to Golden Core quality. How could it withstand a treasure meant for Nascent Soul cultivators?<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong stared fixedly at the Heart-Piercing Scroll: a plain white scroll, its surface marked with natural reed fiber textures, its ends formed of hardened paper soaked in pine resin, edges still rough from the blade, wrapped with a half-faded indigo seal.<br/>
<br/>
“Speak,” urged the White Paper City Lord, her voice like frost.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo remained silent for a moment, then exhaled a long breath:<br/>
<br/>
“In truth, there is nothing here that cannot be spoken.”<br/>
<br/>
“My surname is Ning, given name Zhuo. I hail from Fire Persimmon Immortal City, in the Southern Bean Kingdom. I am a branch clan leader of the Ning family, a close friend of Royal Constable Zhu Xuanji, and the primary ally of the Myriad Medicine Sect. Additionally, I am the son-in-law of General Mu of Two Notes Kingdom…”<br/>
<br/>
“I travel the world in search of relics left behind by my mother, yet my efforts have been fruitless. Upon Zhu Xuanji’s advice, I sought out Senior Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer here in White Paper Immortal City to seek her divination.”<br/>
<br/>
“To that end, I brought a token…”<br/>
<br/>
As he spoke, Ning Zhuo took out the White Jade Candle and displayed it before the City Lord’s avatar.<br/>
<br/>
The City Lord’s pupils instantly contracted.<br/>
<br/>
In her mind, a prophetic poem sprang forth:<br/>
<br/>
"Ghost tides surge, White Paper in peril,<br/>
<br/>
A lone goose carries a candle, piercing heaven’s veil.<br/>
<br/>
The guest star appears in the north of the literary pivot,<br/>
<br/>
Myriad Manifestations Lamp ignites, shattering calamity."<br/>
<br/>
Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer had been her closest lieutenant; there had been no secrets between them.<br/>
<br/>
The City Lord reached out, took the White Jade Candle in her palm, and after verifying its authenticity, spoke:<br/>
<br/>
“The White Jade Candle was a token Little Yue only ever distributed eleven times throughout her entire life.”<br/>
<br/>
Her tone shifted slightly:<br/>
<br/>
“Why did you not present it earlier? And why were you masquerading as another? Did you kill Jiao Ma?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo gave a bitter smile.<br/>
<br/>
“I was a stranger here, unfamiliar with the situation. I decided to disguise myself, gather information, and find a way to request an audience with Senior Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer.”<br/>
<br/>
“However, along the way, I stumbled upon a battlefield littered with the dead. Seizing the chance, I impersonated one of the fallen.”<br/>
<br/>
“Unexpectedly, fortune turned to misfortune, and I was dragged into the city, registered as one of the male consorts.”<br/>
<br/>
“I wanted to reveal my identity to Senior Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer, but after two assassination attempts, the security became suffocatingly tight. Had I revealed my true face, I feared it would cause an even greater misunderstanding, given the city was under strict martial law.”<br/>
<br/>
“Thus, I had no choice but to bide my time, planning to confess during the evaluation trials.”<br/>
<br/>
“But now… things have turned out like this.”<br/>
<br/>
The White Paper City Lord once again fell into deep thought.<br/>
<br/>
Her fingers tightened imperceptibly around the White Jade Candle, betraying the turmoil in her heart.<br/>
<br/>
She certainly knew of Yang Weida, but now that she understood Ning Zhuo’s true identity, she found herself leaning toward another, far more complex conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
Although uncertain, her interest in Ning Zhuo surged uncontrollably, prompting her to ask softly, “Who was your mother? Why are you seeking her relics?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s face took on a sorrowful expression, “My mother’s name was Meng Yaoyin. She passed away when I was just two. My purpose in journeying across the lands is quite simple - first and foremost, to learn more about my mother…”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo didn’t reveal everything, hiding his primary goal of resurrecting his mother. He rambled on truthfully for a while, which didn’t trigger the Truth-Seeking Scroll floating above him at all.<br/>
<br/>
White Paper City Lord fell into silence once again.<br/>
<br/>
This silence lasted longer than any previous one.<br/>
<br/>
Breaking the silence, her voice somewhat hoarse, she remarked, “You are indeed a filial child.”<br/>
<br/>
“Very well.”<br/>
<br/>
“I’ll grant you three Protective Talisman Charms. Investigate for me and uncover the true culprit behind the murder of Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer.”<br/>
<br/>
As she spoke, White Paper City Lord flicked her fingers, and three charms flashed by as white streaks, instantly sinking into Ning Zhuo’s body.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was greatly alarmed and quickly examined himself, only to see the three talismans occupying the most central spots in his three primary dantians.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo bitterly cupped his hands, smiling wryly, “Esteemed City Lord, you clearly see through everything, and with the Heart-Piercing Scroll here, you’ve long known I’m innocent.”<br/>
<br/>
“I am merely at the Foundation Establishment level, too young and weak - how could I shoulder such a critical task?”<br/>
<br/>
City Lord White Paper laughed dryly, “If you don’t wish to investigate, feel free to leave White Paper Immortal City right now. Consider these three talismans my farewell gift.”<br/>
<br/>
With that, she swept her sleeve and vanished from the spot.<br/>
<br/>
Along with her disappearance, the corpse of the Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer also vanished.<br/>
<br/>
However, before leaving, she left behind some words: “With Little Le’s death, attacks have erupted inside and outside the city. Ignore what’s happening outside. Near the south gate within the city, an assault is underway. <br/>
<br/>
The statue at the southern gate is a node in the city’s great defensive formation. Investigate there, and you might uncover some clues.”<br/>
<br/>
“Wen Ruanyu will accompany you.”<br/>
<br/>
“If you have no wish to find the real culprit, suit yourself. The ghost tide at the south gate is the weakest, so you can easily leave.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo stood frozen in shock.<br/>
<br/>
White Paper City Lord’s leniency was entirely unexpected.<br/>
<br/>
The grand formation of Pavillion of Quiet Whispers had halted, and Ning Zhuo regained his freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong’s consciousness transmitted a message, scoffing, “Hmph, that paper-thin old hag talks nice, saying you’re free to leave the city. But if that’s true, why leave three talismans inside your body? Clearly, they’re there to monitor you - blades dangling right over our necks!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed deeply.<br/>
<br/>
Wen Ruanyu entered, his expression grim. Urging quickly, he said, “Since the City Lord declared you innocent and tasked you with investigating, come with me.”<br/>
<br/>
“Hurry! The situation at the south gate is severe - several Golden Core-level ghost generals are wreaking havoc!”<br/>
<br/>
South of the city.<br/>
<br/>
The battle surrounding the half-intact paper statue had reached a critical juncture.<br/>
<br/>
“Hold the line! We must hold!” the human cultivators shouted, boosting morale.<br/>
<br/>
A butcher ghost general, massive as a mountain of flesh, wielded a bone-cleaving blade the size of a door, slashing fiercely.<br/>
<br/>
The attack erupted, shaking the protective barrier violently until it nearly shattered.<br/>
<br/>
Cultivators manning the formation heart and nodes strained desperately, pouring forth spiritual energy to sustain the shield.<br/>
<br/>
Mirror Makeup Ghost General wielded a bronze mirror, releasing blinding beams that rattled the cultivators inside, destabilizing their spiritual energy and causing the barrier’s strength to plummet.<br/>
<br/>
Blabbermouth Ghost General laughed madly, “It’s breaking, breaking, breaking!” Besides the normal mouth, he had two more on each cheek, speaking simultaneously, creating eerie sound waves.<br/>
<br/>
Under these sonic assaults, the defensive barrier shattered abruptly.<br/>
<br/>
Human cultivators defending the formation suffered severe backlash, vomiting blood and collapsing helplessly.<br/>
<br/>
Their fighting spirit broken, they were lambs awaiting slaughter.<br/>
<br/>
The three Golden Core ghost generals charged forward immediately. The butcher general began massacring the cultivators while the other two surged deeper inward.<br/>
<br/>
“Damn it! We’re too late!” Wen Ruanyu, accompanied by Ning Zhuo, arrived just in time to witness the barrier collapse, overcome by fury and grief.<br/>
<br/>
“Though the City Lord’s mandate exempts you from the city’s formation suppression, you’re still merely a Foundation Establishment cultivator - stay back and protect yourself.”<br/>
<br/>
With a quick instruction, Wen Ruanyu disregarded Ning Zhuo and leaped into combat.<br/>
<br/>
As a scholar cultivator, he brandished a brush, his literary techniques formidable, surpassing typical Golden Core practitioners.<br/>
<br/>
The butcher ghost general had barely killed a few before being suppressed by Wen Ruanyu’s swift brush strokes, unable to overpower the refined yet fierce techniques.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong, inside the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, transmitted, “Little Zhuo, seize this opportunity - I’ll help you extract those talismans from your three dantians!”<br/>
<br/>
Yet, throughout their journey, Ning Zhuo had been pondering White Paper City Lord’s attitude towards him, sensing that something deeply unusual lay beneath her actions.<br/>
<br/>
The latter was indeed far too agreeable.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding Sun Lingtong’s analysis, he was somewhat in agreement.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, he slowly nodded, saying, “Boss, I’ll have to trouble you to look into this thoroughly. White Paper City Lord’s so-called generosity surely masks deeper intentions.”<br/>
<br/>
With Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer dead, Ning Zhuo saw no further reason to stay.<br/>
<br/>
“This method can indeed be replicated. She’s certainly not the only one in this world capable of divination,” Ning Zhuo pondered inwardly, unwilling to linger in White Paper Immortal City any longer.<br/>
<br/>
The city’s troubled state, both internally and externally, along with his recent experiences, left him utterly speechless.<br/>
<br/>
Just look at the current situation - the three Ghost Generals weren’t even restrained by the city’s grand formation. How absurd! This state of affairs clearly stemmed from previous entanglements. Respecting others’ fates, Ning Zhuo had no interest in lingering amid this mess any further.<br/>
<br/>
Boom!<br/>
<br/>
At precisely that moment, Wen Ruanyu’s clash with the three Golden Core-level Ghost Generals completely shattered the formation, opening up the space to reveal the workshop within.<br/>
<br/>
Fierce ghostly flames erupted inside the workshop, nearly reducing it to ruins.<br/>
<br/>
A panicked craftsman shouted, “Master Wen, protect the giant statue’s head at all costs! If it’s destroyed, we won’t be able to craft another!”<br/>
<br/>
Wen Ruanyu’s expression changed drastically.<br/>
<br/>
The Mirror Makeup Ghost General struggled desperately, providing an opportunity for Blabbermouth Ghost General, who swiftly moved first, placing his foot directly on the statue’s head.<br/>
<br/>
“Damn it!” Wen Ruanyu immediately felt helpless, inwardly cursing his misfortune.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s gaze was naturally drawn toward the unfolding scene.<br/>
<br/>
The next instant, he froze completely - this was the first time he had clearly seen the statue’s head.<br/>
<br/>
It was…<br/>
<br/>
“Mother?!”</div></body></html></div>
