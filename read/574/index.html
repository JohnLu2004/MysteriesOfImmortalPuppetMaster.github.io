<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The fierce battle on the river raged onward.<br/>
<br/>
Bone-chilling Crocodiles hurled themselves recklessly at the ships, their sturdy bodies crashing incessantly into the sides and undersides of the vessels. This was exactly the sort of scenario where Beast-Taming sects excelled: low-intelligence demonic beasts could be easily manipulated into frenzied self-sacrifice.<br/>
<br/>
The crocodiles’ relentless assault finally bore fruit.<br/>
<br/>
The outermost redwood warship couldn’t withstand the brutal impacts any longer, eventually splitting open to reveal gaping holes. Murky black river water surged inside, quickly followed by the frenzied crocodiles scrambling to invade and massacre the cultivators within.<br/>
<br/>
Panic erupted aboard the damaged vessel, cultivators scrambling desperately to patch breaches even as they fought off the armored crocodiles, whose spiny bone plating inflicted grievous wounds. Casualties began to soar alarmingly.<br/>
<br/>
Worst of all, the defensive formation on the warship rapidly weakened due to structural damage - akin to a fortress wall collapsing under siege.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, even the central vessel began to creak ominously, its railings buckling under the relentless battering.<br/>
<br/>
A particularly formidable crocodile, nearly reaching the Golden Core stage, suddenly leaped aboard the ship’s stern, rampaging wildly among the crew and causing catastrophic casualties.<br/>
<br/>
Yang Weida shouted urgently, “Hold your ground! Hold the line!”<br/>
<br/>
He wanted desperately to unleash his full power; however, the ship’s confined space held him back, for he was fearful of accidentally harming his own comrades.<br/>
<br/>
“Damn it! I’ve been a merchant for years, barely scraping together a fortune. Now that I’ve finally gotten a chance to rise above mediocrity, is it really going to end here?” Yang Weida grit his teeth in frustration, quietly shuffling backwards amidst the chaos, subtly retreating towards the relative safety of the ship’s bow.<br/>
<br/>
Yang believed everyone else too occupied with battle to notice his cowardly maneuver. Little did he know that every detail of the battlefield was plainly visible to Sun and Ning.<br/>
<br/>
Having just emerged from the devastating war in the Two Note Kingdom, to Sun and Ning, the river skirmish - though intense and brutal - seemed rather trivial by comparison.<br/>
<br/>
Flying Bone Shield.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong skillfully commanded a bone shield hovering in midair, forcefully knocking down a crocodile trying to scale the ship’s side.<br/>
<br/>
Malevolent Soul Saber.<br/>
<br/>
Pivoting flawlessly, as if possessing eyes at the back of his head, Sun cleanly severed the head of another attacking beast with a swift blade stroke.<br/>
<br/>
Despite having acquired these magical artifacts only recently, Sun wielded them with astonishing mastery, slaughtering crocodiles with remarkable ease.<br/>
<br/>
“Be careful. I sense a concealed presence lurking deep beneath the river,” Sun secretly communicated to Ning Zhuo through divine sense.<br/>
<br/>
Originating from the Void Sect, Sun’s detection skills far exceeded Ning’s own.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo mentally nodded in agreement. “Makes sense. The Bone Crocodile Demon clearly has familiarity with Elder Qing Yan and dares ambush this convoy. It’s natural he’d prepare backup.”<br/>
<br/>
“They’re all Golden Core cultivators; this hidden threat likely shares similar strength,” Ning added, throwing the harpoon in his grip.<br/>
<br/>
The harpoon was a relic he had scavenged from Jia Ma’s corpse, refining it to enhance his disguise.<br/>
<br/>
The harpoon shot forth with incredible power, piercing and instantly killing a crocodile on impact. With a subtle gesture, Ning Zhuo effortlessly drew the harpoon back into his hand, connected to it by spiritual sense and qi.<br/>
<br/>
Such throwing weapons, unlike swords or sabers which typically remained grasped, could be repeatedly thrown and retrieved, making them particularly versatile.<br/>
<br/>
Sun guarded the perimeter while Ning Zhuo attacked aggressively; even though they currently wore different identities, their coordination remained flawless.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong had previously crafted his own swordsmanship, and now wielding his blade, each stroke was like the fierce roar of a tiger, decisively clearing crocodiles from their vicinity.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, after brief preparations, continuously unleashed lethal strikes, each throw yielding certain death.<br/>
<br/>
“Hey, Little Zhuo, want some excitement?” Sun playfully warned through his divine sense, pretending to stumble from exhaustion, thus allowing a crocodile to break through his defense.<br/>
<br/>
Falling to one knee dramatically, Sun shouted aloud, “Master, watch out!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo snorted coldly in response, immediately canceling his prepared throw. He spun around nimbly, gathering momentum into a fierce, whip-like motion, smashing his harpoon mercilessly into the crocodile’s underbelly and knocking it clean off the ship into the water below.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong teased through divine sense, “Not bad at all, Little Zhuo. Stylish!”<br/>
<br/>
Having trained extensively during his time at the Myriad Medicines Sect, Ning had greatly improved his close-combat skills. The war in Two Note Kingdom further tempered him, granting a composure and grace under pressure that he previously lacked.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing Sun was just teasing him due to their master-servant disguise, Ning Zhuo scolded harshly, “Get up, you clumsy iron lump! Keep fighting and stop embarrassing me!”<br/>
<br/>
Feigning indignation, Sun glared at Ning, replying reluctantly, “Iron lump obeys!”<br/>
<br/>
Though disguised as ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators, their exceptional skills were unmistakable. Revealing only a fraction of their true strength, they’d managed to firmly secure the front of the ship.<br/>
<br/>
“These two are powerful! No wonder Commander Qing Yan values them highly,” Yang Weida thought to himself, now safely retreated near the bow, eyeing Sun and Ning with renewed interest as he moved closer.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, an eerie, sinister laughter echoed across the river.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately after, Qing Yan’s stern rebuke echoed over the water: “Who’s skulking around out there?”<br/>
<br/>
“Hahaha, this old one is Xie Sichao, a Ghost Cultivator. Of course, I ought to be skulking around. I appreciate Commander Qing Yan’s praise,” answered the eerie voice from before, dripping with sarcasm.<br/>
<br/>
With that reply, the speaker’s Golden Core-level aura was unveiled without reservation. The enemy had concealed a second Golden Core cultivator!<br/>
<br/>
Alarm swept across the faces of those aboard, their spirits swiftly faltering.<br/>
<br/>
“They’re coming - it’s the River Ghosts!” Sun Lingtong’s eyes glowed subtly, instantly reporting the scouting results to Ning Zhuo through divine sense.<br/>
<br/>
In the next breath, the swarm of Piercing Bone Crocodiles quickly retreated, replaced by countless phantoms emerging slowly from beneath the dark river, floating up to encircle the three Redwood Battleships.<br/>
<br/>
Hundreds of River Ghosts, draped in tattered black armor, eyes blazing with eerie, ghostly blue flames, brandished hooks and curved sabers, relentlessly battering against the ships.<br/>
<br/>
The crew fought fiercely, unleashing waves of powerful spells followed by a flurry of magical artifacts, chaotically striking the ghosts, halting their advance temporarily. Over fifty River Ghosts dissipated immediately.<br/>
<br/>
“Hahaha, just this?”<br/>
<br/>
“I slew my first River Ghost when I was three!”<br/>
<br/>
“Who around here doesn’t know how to deal with these damned ghosts?”<br/>
<br/>
Morale surged among the cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
However, Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo simultaneously frowned: “Something’s off about these River Ghosts.”<br/>
<br/>
The next instant, Xie Sichao unleashed his tactics:<br/>
<br/>
Military Strategy: Swiftness of Soldiers!<br/>
<br/>
Military Strategy: Armor Enhancement!<br/>
<br/>
Instantly, the River Ghosts’ defense and speed surged several times over. They braced against the bombardment of spells and artifacts, hacking through ship’s railings and storming aboard in waves.<br/>
<br/>
The stalemate shattered in an instant.<br/>
<br/>
The defenders’ situation deteriorated sharply, teetering on the brink of collapse!<br/>
<br/>
Truthfully, each River Ghost possessed less than sixty percent of a Piercing Bone Crocodile’s strength, but under the boosts provided by the military formations, their power instantly skyrocketed, easily surpassing the crocodiles.<br/>
<br/>
Qing Yan burst from the water’s surface, soaring into the air to cast two potent defensive spells onto the three battleships, barely stabilizing the dire situation.<br/>
<br/>
“Yin Soldiers? So you’re from one of the Netherworld courts?” Qing Yan’s expression turned grave, filled with anger and apprehension. “Is the Netherworld again interfering in the affairs of the mortal realm?”<br/>
<br/>
The Bone-armored Crocodile Demon emerged from the waters once more, his armor now cracked and broken in many places, and the crocodile mount beneath him replaced entirely. He pointed arrogantly at Qing Yan and sneered, “Even if I told you which Netherworld court it was, what could you possibly do about it? Our City Overthrowing Alliance is far more powerful than you’ve imagined!”<br/>
<br/>
“Qing Yan, if you kneel and beg now, perhaps I’ll spare your pitiful life.”<br/>
<br/>
Xie Sichao, still unseen, leisurely retorted, “We know very well the boundary between Yin and Yang. We have no interest in fully occupying the mortal realm or repeating past wars. The Ghostly Black Marshlands already closely resembles the Netherworld. It’s merely a little window through which we Netherworld cultivators wish to take a breath of fresh air - surely that’s permissible?”<br/>
<br/>
Qing Yan glared at the Crocodile Demon with undisguised disgust. “You mortals collaborating with Netherworld powers - you’re utterly shameless!”<br/>
<br/>
“Shameless?” The Crocodile Demon scoffed, murderous intent blazing. “For the sake of freedom and the purity of this land, our City Overthrowing Alliance must make sacrifices. Reputation is only one of them. This is our conviction!”<br/>
<br/>
“Qing Yan, today you and your subordinates shall perish here!”<br/>
<br/>
With these words, the Crocodile Demon charged again.<br/>
<br/>
The situation had drastically shifted.<br/>
<br/>
Though the Crocodile Demon alone was no match for Qing Yan, with Xie Sichao’s concealed support, Qing Yan found himself increasingly at a disadvantage.<br/>
<br/>
Forced to order the retreat of the three ships, Qing Yan struggled bitterly, fending off two Golden Core opponents while protecting his subordinates aboard the battleships. Before long, multiple injuries accumulated on his body, pushing him toward defeat.<br/>
<br/>
If Qing Yan fell now, the fate of everyone aboard the ships would be grimly certain.<br/>
<br/>
“Boss, what’s our move?” Ning Zhuo transmitted via divine sense to Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong glanced back, secretly smiling in approval.<br/>
<br/>
Back in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Ning Zhuo would undoubtedly have retreated discreetly, biding his time. After all, escaping with the Wandering Dragon was effortless.<br/>
<br/>
Yet now, filled with the heroic vigor of the battlefield, Ning Zhuo didn’t consider retreating at all - rather, he felt an urge to fight a great battle!<br/>
<br/>
This decisively suited Sun Lingtong’s tastes perfectly.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong quickly responded through divine sense, “I can’t clearly sense the situation at the river bottom, nor Xie Sichao’s exact position. So, our only viable target is that noisy Gold Core cultivator, smugly perched on his crocodile mount, endlessly boasting and flaunting.”<br/>
<br/>
“Agreed!” Ning Zhuo replied instantly, without hesitation.<br/>
<br/>
Although both were merely at the Foundation Establishment stage, their hearts harboured no fear when plotting to take down a Golden Core cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
The Two Note War had tempered them; they’d even slain Nascent Soul cultivators before! With such experiences, their bearing naturally differed from the ordinary.<br/>
<br/>
However, while the two were pretending to fight and secretly scheming, suddenly, another Golden Core aura pierced through the sky.<br/>
<br/>
A middle-aged scholar appeared, soaring through the air. Holding a brush, he swiftly inscribed characters mid-air, and in mere breaths, wrote down a passage from the “Classic of Rites,” forming a restrictive law.<br/>
<br/>
The restriction transformed into countless characters, scattering across the battlefield and accurately embedding themselves into the bodies of the water ghost soldiers.<br/>
<br/>
In astonishment, everyone saw these fierce water ghosts suddenly drop their weapons. Some slapped their own faces frantically, others knelt down apologizing, and many bowed politely, performing various courteous gestures.<br/>
<br/>
The previously savage soldiers suddenly turned into respectful, polite gentlemen. Seizing the opportunity, the village cultivators counterattacked furiously, swiftly slaying over a hundred water ghosts.<br/>
<br/>
“It’s Master Wen Ruanyu!”<br/>
<br/>
“We’re saved!”<br/>
<br/>
Cheers erupted, morale soaring.<br/>
<br/>
Qing Yan immediately identified himself and briefed Wen Ruanyu on the situation. Wen Ruanyu nodded slightly, standing high in the sky, swiftly writing countless more characters.<br/>
<br/>
Words poured down like torrential rain, utterly shattering the morale of the water ghost soldiers, allowing the villagers to swiftly regain control and push the enemy back.<br/>
<br/>
“Could this be a Confucian Cultivator?” Ning Zhuo widened his eyes. It was his first encounter with such a cultivator in real life.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong nodded in confirmation. “Indeed. This is imbued with profound literary energy and national strength, marking him clearly as a Confucian Cultivator.”<br/>
<br/>
Confucian Cultivators were rare sights in the Southern Bean Kingdom, just as in Northern Wind and Two Note Kingdom. Their true sanctuary lay in the Hua Zhang Kingdom, a cultivation nation ruled solely by Confucianism, reputedly suppressing all other teachings in favour of Confucian doctrine.<br/>
<br/>
With Wen Ruanyu skilfully employing national strength and Confucian techniques, the water ghost soldiers were effortlessly subdued.<br/>
<br/>
“At the peak of Golden Core with excellent mentorship, this man isn’t ordinary.” Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong swiftly concluded while observing from afar.<br/>
<br/>
Confucian Technique - “Literary Suppression of Martial Force!”<br/>
<br/>
Wen Ruanyu hovered high above, literary energy surging vividly around him.<br/>
<br/>
Under the suppression of his Confucian art, all combat effects on both sides significantly decreased, instantly calming the intensity of the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
“Strategist Xie, this man is the right-hand man of White Paper City’s lord. We’d best retreat now,” said the previously belligerent Bone Crocodile Demon, utterly demoralized.<br/>
<br/>
“Hmph, very well,” Xie Sichao agreed coldly, immediately ordering a retreat.<br/>
<br/>
Wen Ruanyu didn’t pursue, instead protecting the ships. Qing Yan attempted to chase but was advised by Wen Ruanyu, “Never chase a desperate foe.”<br/>
<br/>
“I still have pressing matters elsewhere,” Wen Ruanyu announced. “Qing Yan, I’ll entrust the rest to you. Head swiftly to White Paper City. If the enemy returns, shatter this jade token - I’ll sense it immediately.”<br/>
<br/>
He threw a token to Qing Yan, who quickly thanked him. Wen Ruanyu nodded slightly and flew northward.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, after several hundred steps, he abruptly turned back, scanning the cultivators below: “By the way, are there any outsiders among you?”<br/>
<br/>
The group glanced at each other, eventually settling their gaze upon Yang Weida.<br/>
<br/>
“So, there really is one?” Wen Ruanyu felt something amiss. “Take out everything you carry.”<br/>
<br/>
“What?” Yang Weida exclaimed in confusion.<br/>
<br/>
The surrounding cultivators subtly encircled him, hostility in their eyes. Qing Yan glared sternly at Yang Weida, “Do as Master Wen commands.”<br/>
<br/>
Panicking, Yang Weida hastily complied, insisting anxiously, “I swear I’m no spy!” He hurriedly laid out all his possessions for inspection.<br/>
<br/>
Though Wen Ruanyu saw no candle flames, he noticed several Soul-Ferrying Lamp Wicks. His heart stirred slightly: “Lord Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer asked me to watch for candle-related items. Do these wicks count?”<br/>
<br/>
“Regardless, I’ll take him with me first,” he decided.<br/>
<br/>
Originally stationed in White Paper City managing vital tasks, Wen Ruanyu had been dispatched urgently after a divination by the Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer, instructing him to search northward for a critical figure.<br/>
<br/>
Having stumbled upon this river battle and recognizing Qing Yan as an ally from White Paper City, Wen Ruanyu intervened immediately. Discovering Yang Weida, he wasn’t entirely sure but decided to keep Yang Weida close while continuing his investigation.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, Wen Ruanyu carried away the anxious Yang Weida and flew off. Qing Yan reorganized his subordinates swiftly, resuming their journey toward White Paper City.</div>
