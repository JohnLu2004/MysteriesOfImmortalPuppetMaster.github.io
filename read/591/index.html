<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
White Paper Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
Southern district.<br/>
<br/>
Inside a concealed formation space housing a massive paper puppet.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged, suspended mid-air, hands gripping the Thousand Paths Lantern, having already refined it to about eighty percent.<br/>
<br/>
In a corner, Wen Ruanyu’s painted avatar watched Ning Zhuo closely, prepared to react at the slightest indication of him fleeing with the treasure.<br/>
<br/>
Outwardly, Ning Zhuo appeared calm, his eyes lightly closed, yet internally, turbulent waves surged fiercely.<br/>
<br/>
Through the eighty percent connection with the Thousand Paths Lantern, he had glimpsed an astonishing vision of the Underworld.<br/>
<br/>
In an expansive Underworld cavern stood vast ranks of paper soldiers, closely arrayed. Their armor, thin as cicada wings, rustled eerily in the chilling wind, each plate adorned with cinnabar-painted stars.<br/>
<br/>
Their faces were heavily made up, slanting eyebrows stabbing into their temples, cheeks blushed with rouge resembling ancient bloodstains, and lips painted into razor-thin lines.<br/>
<br/>
At the forefront stood imposing cavalry mounted upon paper oxen.<br/>
<br/>
These cavalrymen grasped towering paper spears, their figures impressively tall and robust.<br/>
<br/>
The paper oxen bore silver foil horseshoes wrapped around their hooves, their eyes inset with luminous glazed beads that flickered ghostly light in the cold breeze. The creases on their necks clearly showed marks of bamboo framework beneath.<br/>
<br/>
As the ghostly wind swept across their backs, delicate ripples ran across the paper hides, revealing intricate pagoda-tree wood skeletons beneath, each covered in meticulous soul-binding talismans.<br/>
<br/>
Behind the cavalry marched infantry armed with paper spears and shields.<br/>
<br/>
These soldiers were the most numerous, uniformly equipped with long talismanic spears and large defensive shields.<br/>
<br/>
Trailing them stood eight hundred crossbow-wielding paper puppets. Their bowstrings, tightly wound from ox sinews, were loaded with paper arrows dipped in corpse wax, their fletching made from tattered burial flags.<br/>
<br/>
At the army’s core, thirty-six war chariots stood ready, each drawn by four paper steeds. Sitting upon each chariot’s shaft were three paper-crafted deities, each bearing three heads and six arms, wielding cloud gongs, wind banners, and rain pennants. The bronze bells hanging from the chariot canopies were wrapped in white linen, rendering them eerily silent.<br/>
<br/>
Surrounded by these chariots stood the central battle standard.<br/>
<br/>
A towering nine-zhang-nine-chi white silk banner fluttered violently, adorned not with dragons and tigers, but densely embroidered golden foil characters of reincarnation incantations. Instead of a spearhead atop the flagpole, there was a paper-crafted soul-summoning banner, with seven layers of tails trailing down, thousands of paper coins woven into tassels, each coin threaded meticulously with hair-thin crimson threads.<br/>
<br/>
Beneath the great standard stood a paper marshal.<br/>
<br/>
He bore three war flags upon his back, hands empty of weapons, clad in dazzlingly colorful paper armor. His eyes were pitch-black, seemingly shut as if resting, poised to unleash a ruthless charge at the first command.<br/>
<br/>
This meticulously constructed paper army numbered thousands, complete with cavalry, chariots, strong crossbowmen, fierce infantry, and a commanding general!<br/>
<br/>
Such remarkable military discipline and splendor left Ning Zhuo deeply moved. Truly, the formation was majestic, weapons aligned in perfect order, armored ranks resembling fierce beasts waiting to strike.<br/>
<br/>
“My mother actually hid such an army in the Underworld!”<br/>
<br/>
Though Ning Zhuo had never encountered such an army before, his experiences in Two Note Kingdom, combined with his current connection through the Thousand Paths Lantern, informed him clearly: this paper army was exceedingly elite, surpassing even his own mechanical troops and the Three General Battalion, comparable perhaps only to the Red Flower Battalion.<br/>
<br/>
“Such extravagance is astonishing. If I could command this force at the right moment, it could overturn the situation within the city.”<br/>
<br/>
“Ah, almost forgot—I’ve already lost my military rank.”<br/>
<br/>
Not long after leaving Two Note Kingdom, Ning Zhuo realized his strategist seal had become invalid. Though expected, the realization still stirred a faint disappointment.<br/>
<br/>
This shocking discovery raised more questions: “Though White Paper Immortal City has its city guard, it lacks any formal military structure. Without proper organization, how can such a mighty force demonstrate true battle prowess?”<br/>
<br/>
From his conversations with the White Paper City Lord’s avatar, Ning Zhuo had learned many hidden truths.<br/>
<br/>
Though the city guard was powerful, it had no formal military formation and thus relied entirely upon the city’s grand defensive formations to withstand ghostly sieges, lacking the capacity to launch any counterattacks.<br/>
<br/>
Building a formal army was not an easy feat.<br/>
<br/>
Even White Paper Immortal City, a dominant city entrenched in the Ghostly Black Marshlands with abundant resources, had yet to establish such a structured military force.<br/>
<br/>
Thus arose a significant issue: without formal military structure, this paper army could not reach its full potential, making it little more than impressive decoration.<br/>
<br/>
“There’s more?!”<br/>
<br/>
The next discovery further astonished Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn’t merely a single hidden paper army—across various secretive corners of the Underworld, buried beneath grounds and concealed within valleys, multiple similar paper armies lay hidden.<br/>
<br/>
These forces bore remarkably similar structures and numbers.<br/>
<br/>
“This can’t be my mother’s doing,” Ning Zhuo concluded firmly.<br/>
<br/>
“Though she was a true disciple of a top-tier sect and possessed Golden Core cultivation, her financial resources surely wouldn’t permit such vast expenditures.”<br/>
<br/>
Although Ning Zhuo was an outsider in such matters, he could roughly gauge the enormity of the cost involved.<br/>
<br/>
To put it bluntly, even with his current vast wealth, crafting merely a tenth of such a paper army would already push his limits to the extreme!<br/>
<br/>
Normally, a Nascent Soul cultivator’s lifetime accumulation of resources wouldn’t even begin to suffice. According to Ning Zhuo’s observations, each commander of these paper armies would immediately exhibit Nascent Soul-level combat prowess once activated!<br/>
<br/>
By now, Ning Zhuo had already discovered four such armies.<br/>
<br/>
As he continued refining the Thousand Paths Lantern and deepening his connection, he speculated that even more armies might emerge.<br/>
<br/>
His guess was soon confirmed.<br/>
<br/>
When Ning Zhuo fully refined the Thousand Paths Lantern, he uncovered a total of seven paper armies, though the last army was still incomplete.<br/>
<br/>
“Hm?” Ning Zhuo carefully examined this seventh army and noticed that it was still slowly forming.<br/>
<br/>
The bamboo skeleton had been erected, and a stark white talisman paper appeared seemingly out of thin air, drifting gently onto the bamboo framework. Symbols gradually took shape upon the paper, appearing at an incredibly slow pace, so slow that even after half a day, a single rune might remain incomplete.<br/>
<br/>
It felt as if an invisible hand was patiently crafting the paper figure.<br/>
<br/>
Though the entire process was painstakingly slow, it radiated a sense of relentless determination and quiet endurance.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo calmed his heart and observed attentively, feeling his heart shudder once again: “This is the innate power of White Paper Immortal City itself!”<br/>
<br/>
It was this very immortal city quietly weaving together paper armies within the netherworld.<br/>
<br/>
At this pace, forming just a single army would require decades.<br/>
<br/>
Seven paper armies…<br/>
<br/>
This was the result of years upon years of silent accumulation!<br/>
<br/>
“So, who exactly established White Paper Immortal City, and what was their true purpose?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had uncovered the core secret of White Paper Immortal City!<br/>
<br/>
“Does the current White Paper City Lord know about this secret?”<br/>
<br/>
After some consideration, Ning Zhuo concluded that it was unlikely.<br/>
<br/>
The reason was simple.<br/>
<br/>
When his mother first arrived at White Paper Immortal City, the city had nearly been destroyed by a ghost tide. If the City Lord had known about such a powerful hidden card, why would they ever have resorted to seeking aid from Myriad Manifestations Sect?<br/>
<br/>
Did they truly think that such assistance came without a price?<br/>
<br/>
Look at Wen Ruanyu now—she remained stationed here as the representative of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, becoming one of the city’s key figures.<br/>
<br/>
Clearly, White Paper Immortal City had to annually funnel substantial resources to the Myriad Manifestations Sect.<br/>
<br/>
And it wasn’t only Myriad Manifestations Sect involved.<br/>
<br/>
There were also demonic sects like Soul Devouring Sect, which had established their own branches here. Otherwise, Ning Zhuo wouldn’t have been operating under his charred, disguised identity until now.<br/>
<br/>
“Did Mother inform the White Paper City Lord about her arrangements here?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s brow furrowed deeper at this complicated thought.<br/>
<br/>
Considering this question required examining Meng Yaoyin’s true stance.<br/>
<br/>
“Mother was benevolent and compassionate, willing to sacrifice her own lifespan to protect this city, truly a paragon of righteousness. But she was also a core disciple of the Myriad Manifestations Sect. What exactly was her relationship with the sect?”<br/>
<br/>
Had Meng Yaoyin directly reported this matter to her sect back then, things might be simpler.<br/>
<br/>
The crux was that Meng Yaoyin had insisted on hiding the truth, even claiming she had lost her palace lantern, causing her failure at the Flying Cloud Conference. What reason compelled her to conceal everything?<br/>
<br/>
Layer upon layer of mysteries!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was momentarily puzzled, prompting Sun Lingtong to inquire with concern: “Little Zhuo, did you encounter trouble refining it? Perhaps my theft skills can help?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head and explained the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was first surprised: “The Thousand Paths Lantern is a treasure-grade artifact, yet you refined it so swiftly. I thought it would take at least three days and nights.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo realized belatedly: “Mechanical constructs aren’t unified entities, making them inherently easier to refine compared to standard treasures.”<br/>
<br/>
“However, even accounting for this, I refined it extraordinarily fast!”<br/>
<br/>
“Perhaps because Mother’s blood flows within me, this made it easier?”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong reminded him gently: “That’s not our main focus right now.”<br/>
<br/>
“Little Zhuo, you’ve discovered something massive—this is incredibly fortunate!”<br/>
<br/>
“See if you can extract these paper armies and hide them on our persons?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately shook his head. “It’s as difficult as ascending to heaven!”<br/>
<br/>
The Paper Army was part of White Paper Immortal City itself. To seize control would mean manipulating the very city’s own restrictions, not to mention overcoming the barrier between the realms of yin and yang.<br/>
<br/>
Even though Ning Zhuo had refined the Thousand Paths Lantern, all he could manage was mere perception; actual control was impossible.<br/>
<br/>
“Ah, what a pity! Such a pity!” Inside the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, Sun Lingtong cradled his head, sighing mournfully.<br/>
<br/>
To him, this was agonizing—like entering a mountain filled with treasures yet leaving empty-handed!<br/>
<br/>
“No! This won’t do!”<br/>
<br/>
“I refuse to accept it. Ning Zhuo!”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong’s stubbornness flared up, prompting him to ask urgently, “Besides sensing these armies, is there really no other way to influence them?”<br/>
<br/>
“Well, that’s not exactly true…” Ning Zhuo hesitated.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong knew Ning Zhuo far too well. His eyes immediately lit up with excitement, grumbling irritably, “I knew it! Your mother was extraordinary—every bit my master’s equal. How could her arrangements be so shallow?”<br/>
<br/>
“Out with it! Stop hiding things from me!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo finally admitted, “Once I fully refine the Thousand Paths Lantern, I could use it to detach a soul and implant it directly into one of the paper soldiers, activating it. Elder Brother, you…”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong waved a hand to interrupt Ning Zhuo, bursting into triumphant laughter. “I’ll go!”<br/>
<br/>
Just as Sun Lingtong understood Ning Zhuo deeply, Ning Zhuo knew Sun Lingtong equally well.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had kept quiet precisely because he feared Sun Lingtong would impulsively take risks again.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, Ning Zhuo wouldn’t lie outright, but withholding certain details was still feasible.<br/>
<br/>
Now, as Ning Zhuo feared, Sun Lingtong was adamant, driven by the overwhelming temptation of adventure.<br/>
<br/>
“Elder Brother, this isn’t like before,” Ning Zhuo warned solemnly. “Back in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, if you were imprisoned, I could still find ways to rescue you. But this time, you’re sending your soul into the underworld itself. If anything happens, there’s nothing I can do.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong merely chuckled at Ning Zhuo’s caution. “Little Zhuo, you know me well. If I don’t go this time, my heart will never find peace.”<br/>
<br/>
He fervently persuaded Ning Zhuo, first by pointing out that the Mechanical Ring gave no warnings, then by reminding him of their life-linked bond, suggesting that even if trapped, Ning Zhuo could rescue him once he became stronger. Moreover, Sun Lingtong noted that if he managed to steal a paper general, they’d have a fighter at the Nascent Soul level.<br/>
<br/>
“Tell me, aren’t you curious about the real arrangement behind White Paper Immortal City?”<br/>
<br/>
“If you just stay on this side observing, how will you uncover deeper secrets?”<br/>
<br/>
“Relax, I know what I’m doing. I have a strong feeling this journey will yield incredible rewards!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo rolled his eyes internally. “Elder Brother, you say that every single time.”<br/>
<br/>
He fingered his Mechanical Ring again. Seeing it still showed no warning signs, he sighed in resignation. “Fine, fine.”<br/>
<br/>
“I’ll send you down secretly.”<br/>
<br/>
“But let’s set a time limit. Return immediately once it’s reached. Don’t linger too long, or I’ll personally come to get you.”<br/>
<br/>
What else could he do? They were brothers who had supported each other in Fire Persimmon Immortal City for years.<br/>
<br/>
Hearing Ning Zhuo’s promise to rescue him, Sun Lingtong’s expression turned serious. He had no doubt that Ning Zhuo would risk anything, even separating his own soul to save him.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong might disregard his own safety, but he cherished Ning Zhuo deeply. He promptly reminded himself to proceed cautiously to avoid dragging his good brother into trouble.<br/>
<br/>
“There are seven armies, each stationed at a different point. Elder Brother, where do you wish to go?”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong replied without hesitation, “The furthest one.”<br/>
<br/>
The most distant army was the seventh, still incomplete.<br/>
<br/>
Feigning continued refinement of the Thousand Paths Lantern, Ning Zhuo stealthily transported Sun Lingtong’s soul to the underworld.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong’s soul detached and was immediately teleported.<br/>
<br/>
The journey was extremely uncomfortable, feeling as though he were balled up, shoved down a narrow tunnel, constantly tumbling, bumping, swallowing dirt and dust.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong’s soul finally emerged, landing heavily on the soil of the underworld.<br/>
<br/>
He appeared as his usual childish form.<br/>
<br/>
“Pfft!” Sun Lingtong quickly stood up, brushing off the dirt.<br/>
<br/>
“Elder Brother, can you hear me?” Ning Zhuo quietly activated his divine ability Life-Hanging Thread and sent a mental message via the lantern.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong chuckled brightly in response. “Loud and clear, little brother!”<br/>
<br/>
“Now watch your elder brother become a Nascent Soul general!”<br/>
<br/>
Laughing excitedly, he dashed headlong into the paper army, straight toward its heart.<br/>
<br/>
The paper soldiers stood silently, awaiting an inevitable change.</div>
