<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Ning Zhuo's monotonous and repressed life began to become colorful.<br/>
<br/>
With the increasing number of thefts, Sun Lingtong was very satisfied with Ning Zhuo's progress. "Little Zhuo, you learn everything so quickly, you truly have great potential. Why don't you join me and become a member of the Void Sect?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo showed a troubled expression. "Although the Void Sect is your sect, Brother Sun, its reputation is not good. I just want to rob the rich to help the poor and uphold justice, not become a real thief. Ah, Brother Sun, I didn't mean you. You're different from the others, truly!"<br/>
<br/>
"Alright, alright," Sun Lingtong waved his hand repeatedly. "I was just saying. If you don't want to, then forget it."<br/>
<br/>
"You just said you want to rob the rich to help the poor. Let's do something more exciting. Hehe!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was curious. "What's more exciting?"<br/>
<br/>
"Robbery!" Sun Lingtong's eyes sparkled.<br/>
<br/>
In a small alley.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong suddenly jumped out, surrounding a ruffian.<br/>
<br/>
"Robbery!" Sun Lingtong shouted.<br/>
<br/>
"Mm-hmm." Ning Zhuo nodded.<br/>
<br/>
It was his first time robbing someone, and he was a bit nervous.<br/>
<br/>
The ruffian was initially startled, then burst into laughter. "You two kids want to rob me?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong became angry. "How dare you look down on me? Little Zhuo, get him!"<br/>
<br/>
"Mm!" Ning Zhuo charged forward.<br/>
<br/>
He was a Qi Refining cultivator with only the first level of cultivation, while the ruffian was a martial artist who had mastered internal energy.<br/>
<br/>
The two fought evenly, and at a critical moment, Sun Lingtong hit the ruffian on the back of the head with a brick, knocking him out.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was shocked. "He... he won't die, will he?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong proudly dusted off his hands. "Don't worry, I know my limits."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo succeeded, but his mood was not high.<br/>
<br/>
He often got distracted and was filled with anxiety.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong noticed and laughed, pulling him by the hand. "Come, follow me back."<br/>
<br/>
"Back to do what?"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong led him back the way they came, letting Ning Zhuo witness the ruffian waking up.<br/>
<br/>
The ruffian found his belongings gone and flew into a rage, cursing loudly.<br/>
<br/>
He returned to his gang's territory, extorting and blackmailing small vendors along the way to make up for his losses.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo followed from behind, clenching his fists in anger. "Let's rob him again."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's eyes flashed with a sharp light.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, he said, "Little Zhuo, have you ever thought that if we rob him, he will only harm other poor people even more? There's a better way. Why don't we just kill him and make him disappear from this world forever?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was startled, his expression filled with shock and stammered, "K-kill someone? That's not right."<br/>
<br/>
He had never thought of killing anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong smiled slightly and patted Ning Zhuo's shoulder, "If you don't want to, then forget it. I was just mentioning it casually." Ning Zhuo's face turned pale, "We should still teach him a lesson, give him a deep impression, and ensure he receives severe punishment!" With repeated instances of theft and assault, Ning Zhuo quickly grew in actual combat, no longer the naive novice he once was.<br/>
<br/>
"Your mindset is still unstable and needs training. Come with me." Sun Lingtong pulled Ning Zhuo out, attaching talismans to both of them, transforming their appearances into two middle-aged men.<br/>
<br/>
He took Ning Zhuo to a mortal gambling den, where they gambled heavily, experiencing both wins and losses.<br/>
<br/>
The intense atmosphere of the casino opened Ning Zhuo's eyes.<br/>
<br/>
After several hours of gambling, Sun Lingtong took Ning Zhuo home and asked him what he thought.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo said he was enlightened, "So this is how these people think!"<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Sun, you are truly amazing, like you have mind-reading abilities."<br/>
<br/>
"You transmitted your voice to me, constantly analyzing the gamblers' mindsets. From the changes in their expressions, you could deduce the size of the cards in their hands. It's as magical as a spell!" Sun Lingtong asked the key question, "How do you feel about gambling?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head, "I don't like gambling. I prefer to follow a step-by-step approach, accumulating success gradually."<br/>
<br/>
"As long as you enter a gamble, there's a chance of losing. But if you become the one running the casino, you become the player. I prefer to be the player."<br/>
<br/>
"However, I also understand that sometimes not gambling is not an option!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong smacked his lips, "You don't like the feeling of gambling? Just like my master?" Every time he gambled, Sun Lingtong always won more than he lost.<br/>
<br/>
Occasionally, he would take Ning Zhuo to a high-end restaurant, ordering a large table of delicious food to nourish Ning Zhuo's body.<br/>
<br/>
"Come, little brother, let me treat you to a drink." Sun Lingtong pushed a cup of wine towards Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Both of them, disguised by the transformation talismans, appeared as adult men.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took a sip and coughed repeatedly, "It's too spicy, so hard to drink!" Sun Lingtong shook his head, "You don't understand, wine is a good thing."<br/>
<br/>
He originally didn't like drinking either, but over the years, repeatedly entering caves and never finding his master, he gradually began to drown his sorrows in alcohol, experiencing its benefits.<br/>
<br/>
"I have a way." Sun Lingtong called for sweet wine.<br/>
<br/>
This time, Ning Zhuo could drink it down, the wine was sweet and not at all harsh on the throat.<br/>
<br/>
Then, he got drunk, his eyes blurry and his face flushed.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong supported him as they left the restaurant.<br/>
<br/>
On the way home, Ning Zhuo saw someone beckoning to him, "Gentlemen, come and play." He curiously pointed at the sign of the Yan Hong Lou, "Brother Sun, this place should be very fun."<br/>
<br/>
"Every time we pass by, I see people going in and out, and I can hear people playing and singing inside."<br/>
<br/>
"At night, this place is the most lively!"<br/>
<br/>
"Shall we go in and have some fun? It should be quite enjoyable."<br/>
<br/>
But this time, Sun Lingtong's face darkened: "No, we are not going!" <br/>
<br/>
"Little brother, how old are you? This is too early for you." <br/>
<br/>
"Let's go home, I'll take you home!"<br/>
<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
The soul-searching continued.<br/>
<br/>
In Sun Lingtong's home, he had become a prisoner.<br/>
<br/>
His soul and physical body were held by the Investigative Judge.<br/>
<br/>
"The Investigative Judge is one of the Four Great Ghost Judges."<br/>
<br/>
"I used the Divine Seal to summon a deity. Even if it's just an avatar, it's not something a peak Qi Refinement cultivator like Sun Lingtong can resist." <br/>
<br/>
"Though the Void Heart Seal is strong, it shouldn't withstand my relentless soul-searching!" The Blind Judge Cheng Bai's face was cold and stern.<br/>
<br/>
However, despite Sun Lingtong's soul enduring the excruciating torment of the soul-searching for most of the day, Cheng Bai still hadn't obtained any results.<br/>
<br/>
"How can this be?"<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai was astonished.<br/>
<br/>
He snorted coldly and finally used his superior immortal resource.<br/>
<br/>
Netherworld Death Eyes!<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, he could see again.<br/>
<br/>
His vision revealed a dim, gray world.<br/>
<br/>
Only ghostly entities emitted green, blue, and other spectral lights.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai saw the Investigative Judge and Sun Lingtong's soul.<br/>
<br/>
The avatar of the Investigative Judge emitted a grand blue light, extremely stable, shining like a gem.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's soul emitted green light, which fluctuated violently like water waves.<br/>
<br/>
This indicated that his soul was suffering severe damage, and his emotions were in turmoil.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever the waves seemed about to burst forth, a seal would appear deep within Sun Lingtong's soul.<br/>
<br/>
The seal was weak but resilient.<br/>
<br/>
When the waves tried to escape, they would immediately dissipate upon encountering it.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this, Cheng Bai immediately understood: "The divine power of the Investigative Judge is astonishing, and Sun Lingtong cannot stop his soul-searching interrogation."<br/>
<br/>
"But the information obtained from the soul-searching is all erased by the Void Heart Seal, turning into nothingness."<br/>
<br/>
"An ordinary outer disciple could never achieve this."<br/>
<br/>
"Unexpectedly, although Sun Lingtong hasn't practiced the orthodox techniques of the Void Sect, he has such an understanding of the sect's grand principles."<br/>
<br/>
"What a pity, he specializes in the Boy's Technique. If he had practiced the orthodox techniques of the Void Sect, his achievements would be astounding!" Cheng Bai only took a glance before immediately ceasing to use the immortal resource.<br/>
<br/>
The Netherworld Death Eyes possess extraordinary innate power, and in terms of might, they are undoubtedly of the highest immortal grade. <br/>
<br/>
However, they come with a significant drawback that is difficult to avoid.<br/>
<br/>
Each use consumes the eyes, and over time, not only does vision deteriorate, but the eyes also completely perish. <br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai used this innate power excessively, resulting in blindness, which is extremely difficult to cure.<br/>
<br/>
Many powerful healing methods, although capable of restoring normal vision, would damage his innate power. <br/>
<br/>
Once both eyes are blind, each use of the Netherworld Death Eyes shortens his lifespan.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, every time he uses it, his life expectancy decreases, a very high price to pay.<br/>
<br/>
"Using it once is enough." Cheng Bai retrieved Sun Lingtong's soul and stuffed it back into his body.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai sneered, "Next, Sun Lingtong, scream to your heart's content. My soul punishment is unique within the entire sect."<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai activated a spell and summoned various little ghosts to climb onto Sun Lingtong, pressing him down.<br/>
<br/>
His entire body exuded yin energy, and cold winds swirled around him.<br/>
<br/>
He took out coffin nails and viciously nailed them into the back of Sun Lingtong's hands.<br/>
<br/>
Thud, thud.<br/>
<br/>
With two light sounds, Sun Lingtong's hands were nailed to the pillar, his small body suspended in the air, feet dangling off the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong's eyes widened, a guttural sound emanating from his throat.<br/>
<br/>
He glared at Cheng Bai with eyes full of rage.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai was surprised, "Why aren't you screaming? This doesn't make sense."<br/>
<br/>
"I specifically put your soul back into your body to use physical punishment to affect your soul, doubling your pain. Under my soul punishment, you didn't make a sound?"<br/>
<br/>
"Did you use some special spell to isolate the pain?"<br/>
<br/>
"No, that's not right. If you had, I wouldn't have missed it when I used my innate power just now!" Cheng Bai felt suspicious and summoned the Triangular-eyed Demon Cultivator and the Hook-nosed Demon Cultivator into the room.<br/>
<br/>
He cast spells on them, one using coffin nails, the other using soul punishment.<br/>
<br/>
The Triangular-eyed Demon Cultivator screamed in agony, while the Hook-nosed Demon Cultivator's eyes rolled back, foaming at the mouth, and he fainted after just a few breaths.<br/>
<br/>
"That's more like it." Cheng Bai felt relieved, turning to look at Sun Lingtong with a cold and sinister expression, "I didn't expect such a small body to be so tough!"<br/>
<br/>
"Heh heh heh, I want to see how long you can endure!" Cheng Baii's competitive spirit was ignited by Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
He began to torture Sun Lingtong, using various severe punishments.<br/>
<br/>
He wanted to see Sun Lingtong weep in pain, he wanted to hear Sun Lingtong's screams and cries!</div>
