When Ning Zhuo saw the head of the Jiao Clan at the door, a headache set in instantly.<br/>
<br/>
For now, it was still necessary to maintain the identity of “Jiao Ma.”<br/>
<br/>
His grudge with the Twin Ghosts of Heaven and Earth ran too deep.<br/>
<br/>
If his true identity were exposed, the two would undoubtedly come for him. And with both being Nascent Soul cultivators, if they joined forces to corner him, how would he - stripped of his military position - still handle affairs in White Paper Immortal City? How would he ever join the Myriad Manifestations Sect?<br/>
<br/>
“That said, if I can get into the Myriad Manifestations Sect, that super-sect could serve as an excellent shield.”<br/>
<br/>
But that was still a long way off.<br/>
<br/>
For now, Ning Zhuo would be staying in White Paper Immortal City for a while longer, and the disguise was necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Still, he had no desire to waste time with the Jiao Clan Patriarch. He blocked the doorway, face expressionless. “Not long ago, Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer was assassinated and killed.”<br/>
<br/>
“I’m avoiding contact with all suspicious individuals as much as possible.”<br/>
<br/>
The Patriarch’s face flushed red with anger. “I’m your father! And you suspect me?!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s expression didn’t change. “The traitor within the city is exceptionally skilled at disguise. As long as I remain inside this threshold, the formation still offers protection. Whatever you came to say, make it brief.”<br/>
<br/>
The Jiao Clan Patriarch hadn’t expected this kind of reception from the son he’d come specifically to see.<br/>
<br/>
“Fine. Fine.”<br/>
<br/>
He forced down his rage. “My son, I know you’re still angry with me.”<br/>
<br/>
“But everything we asked of you - was for the sake of the clan.”<br/>
<br/>
“Your two older brothers… both lost their primordial yang. To serve the City Lord like that, in such a diminished state - it would’ve been a grave offense!”<br/>
<br/>
“You’re the only one who’s truly suitable.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo cut him off. “Do you have anything else? I’m quite busy right now - cultivating on one hand, investigating for the City Lord on the other.”<br/>
<br/>
Sensing he was being dismissed, the Patriarch did his best to squeeze a smile onto his face. “My son, I’m truly proud that you overcame adversity by your own strength.”<br/>
<br/>
“You’ve brought honor to our Jiao bloodline. Misfortune turned to fortune - now even the City Lord holds you in high regard.”<br/>
<br/>
“That’s why I came.”<br/>
<br/>
“Whatever you need for your investigation, just ask. Our clan will support you with everything we have.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s heart stirred - he caught the hidden meaning instantly. “How many people did the clan send this time?”<br/>
<br/>
The Patriarch didn’t hold back. “Eighty percent. Another ten percent left the Black Swamp, and the final ten - just the old, weak, and infirm - remained behind to guard the ancestral grounds.”<br/>
<br/>
It was standard practice for a cultivation clan to split up in times of calamity, preserving their bloodline.<br/>
<br/>
But sending eighty percent… that was an extreme commitment.<br/>
<br/>
“Eighty percent?” Ning Zhuo looked at the Patriarch, a bit surprised at the man’s boldness. That was practically throwing everything into supporting White Paper Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
The Patriarch’s face turned grim. “It was a decision made after days of deliberation with the clan elders.”<br/>
<br/>
“The living and the dead walk separate paths. No matter how many ghost creatures pour in from the underworld, they rarely surpass the Nascent Soul stage.”<br/>
<br/>
“White Paper Immortal City has stood here for so long - it won’t fall to a ghost tide.”<br/>
<br/>
“Of course, there’s another reason.”<br/>
<br/>
“The City Lord’s latest decree offers generous rewards to every cultivator who comes to aid the city. I’ve never seen such an extravagant bounty in my life!”<br/>
<br/>
Once again, Ning Zhuo caught the hidden meaning. “Heavy rewards bring bold warriors. If White Paper Immortal City is emptying its coffers, it must mean they expect you to risk your lives.”<br/>
<br/>
“Of course. That’s exactly what it is - hazard pay,” the Jiao Clan Patriarch acknowledged without hesitation. “But at this price, I believe it’s worth it. We’ve already received orders: we’ll begin with covert training, then head out to engage the enemy.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo frowned. “That ghost army may not be large, but it’s impeccably disciplined, acts with perfect coordination, and is bolstered by battlefield formations. How could you hope to win in open combat?”<br/>
<br/>
The patriarch laughed heartily. “My son, rest assured. We’re not facing them head-on. Our task is to launch ambushes, cut off their scouts, that sort of thing.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s brows eased slightly. “A war of attrition, then.”<br/>
<br/>
He had battlefield experience - enough to know that, given the circumstances, this was the most White Paper Immortal City could reasonably do.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing that Ning Zhuo still cared for the clan, the patriarch’s earlier anger faded. Before leaving, he reminded him, “My son, the City Lord has summoned troops from nearly every town and village this time.”<br/>
<br/>
“Hidden Yang Manor will likely be packed. You’d best hurry and earn promotion to the Vigorous Yang Residence.”<br/>
<br/>
“If I fall on the battlefield, and you can secure a place in the City Lord’s court, then the family’s future rests on your shoulders.”<br/>
<br/>
At this, the patriarch sighed and took out a jade slip. “This contains our clan’s entire body of techniques, and this is the Patriarch’s Command Token. Keep them both safe. If things go badly, you may need these to revive the clan one day.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo didn’t reach for them. The patriarch simply placed the jade slip and token on the ground, then turned and left.<br/>
<br/>
Watching the scene unfold, Sun Lingtong remarked, “Not bad, Little Zhuo. You just earned yourself a hefty bonus.”<br/>
<br/>
Though Sun Lingtong was inside the ghost army’s camp, Ning Zhuo could transmit scenes from his surroundings to him through the Life Hanging by a Thread technique.<br/>
<br/>
So what Sun Lingtong saw was not much different from if he’d been soaring the skies beside him.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed. The patriarch’s final gesture stirred complicated emotions in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
He couldn’t help but wonder: if his own father were still alive, and faced with such a situation, would he have acted the same way?<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was not Jiao Ma. From an outsider’s view, it was clear - the Jiao Patriarch had placed his son in the safest position available. It was a choice made for the sake of the clan, yes, but also one steeped in a father’s love.<br/>
<br/>
A thought surfaced in Ning Zhuo’s mind. “Boss, we’ve borrowed his son’s identity. I suppose that means we owe the Jiao Clan a favor.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong raised an eyebrow. “Oh? And what do you want to do about it?”<br/>
<br/>
“I’ve got the Patriarch’s token now. I can send swift messages to members of the Jiao Clan. Since you’re inside the enemy camp, how about gathering some intel? I’ll pass it along to them - help them avoid some casualties. It’s the least we can do.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong shrugged. “It’s not like it’s any trouble. Sure, we’ll do it your way.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo ran his fingers over his mechanical ring, then inspected the jade slip and token carefully. Once he was sure they were safe, he put them away.<br/>
<br/>
Besides the Jiao Clan’s cultivation techniques, the jade slip also contained a treasure map.<br/>
<br/>
Before setting out, the clan had made preparations - dividing up their wealth and hidden caches in various locations.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had little interest in the treasure map. The Jiao Clan wasn’t that prestigious. Most of their assets had been distributed among their members. What was left likely wasn’t worth much.<br/>
<br/>
Nor was he especially curious about the cultivation techniques. After glancing through them briefly, he set them aside.<br/>
<br/>
He already had more than he could handle with the supreme methods from Three Sects.<br/>
<br/>
His body cultivation continued steadily, aided by the Embryonic Breath Spirit Boat.<br/>
<br/>
But soul cultivation - that was his true focus now.<br/>
<br/>
After all, possessing four Nascent Soul–grade soul artifacts was no small feat. And the Hungry Ghost Backlash Cauldron and the Underworld Punishment Codex were borrowed from the City Lord. Once he left White Paper Immortal City, he’d have to give them back.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's soul foundation surged at an alarming rate.<br/>
<br/>
Within the city, several night raids had been organized. Though they hadn’t shaken the enemy’s main camp, they had indeed caused trouble and casualties among the ghost troops. All in all, the results were decent.<br/>
<br/>
Wen Ruanyu came to see Ning Zhuo multiple times, urging him to investigate the traitor within.<br/>
<br/>
But how could finding a traitor be that easy?<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was well aware of his own strengths - he wasn't cut out for this kind of detective work. Rather than waste time chasing shadows, he preferred to seize the opportunity before him and devote every second to cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
But Wen Ruanyu was relentless. On one visit, he finally revealed what was on his mind: “The City Lord has entrusted you with a crucial task. How can you afford to slack off? If you press harder, dig up more intel, you might just uncover the spy.”<br/>
<br/>
So that was it. Ning Zhuo, through Sun Lingtong, had been feeding the Jiao Clan real-time military intelligence. Each time they launched a raid, they struck the weakest points of the ghost army’s formation. After doing this repeatedly, it was only natural that some sharp-eyed observer would begin to notice something strange.<br/>
<br/>
To Wen Ruanyu, it simply confirmed one thing: this “Jiao Ma” wasn’t really Jiao Ma at all. The City Lord had assigned him to investigate the spy precisely because of his uncanny ability to gather intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, annoyed by the constant prodding, deflected with a few perfunctory replies.<br/>
<br/>
But Wen Ruanyu was deeply invested in the survival of White Paper Immortal City. He wouldn't be brushed off so easily.<br/>
<br/>
After a moment of thought, Ning Zhuo offered a suggestion: “Senior Wen, there's no need to be so anxious. Whether or not White Paper Immortal City survives this ghost tide ultimately doesn’t hinge on the traitor. The key lies with our City Lord.”<br/>
<br/>
“So long as she recovers, if she can purge the excess yin energy in her body and regain the ability to move freely - then with the power of this city behind her, who could possibly take us down?”<br/>
<br/>
Wen Ruanyu nodded. “You’re not wrong. But the problem is, she’s still in this condition right now.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo fixed him with a steady gaze. “Senior Wen, I don’t believe a place like White Paper Immortal City wouldn’t have prepared a contingency plan for this.”<br/>
<br/>
Wen Ruanyu hesitated briefly, then transmitted his voice directly to Ning Zhuo. “Very well. You’re already the Vice City Lord now. It’s only right that you know.”<br/>
<br/>
He laid out the plan, succinct and to the point.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s eyes flickered with surprise. “The Golden Swallow Trident?”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong learned of it at nearly the same moment and chuckled to himself. “Little Zhuo, that treasure’s name feels like fate. It’s practically made to go with our Sky Iron Heroic Armor. It was meant to be ours!”<br/>
<br/>
The plan was simple. Find a compatible cultivator and have the Golden Swallow Trident recognize them as its master. Then, harness its immense yang energy to purge the City Lord’s overwhelming yin, thereby restoring a measure of her mobility.<br/>
<br/>
Once her burden lightened enough, the City Lord would be able to act again.<br/>
<br/>
Wen Ruanyu sighed. “Originally, Master Jin Yangzi was the best candidate for the task.”<br/>
<br/>
“He was planted here by the White-Haired Dragon Lord. We all knew it, but for the greater good, we held our tongues.”<br/>
<br/>
“Unfortunately, the traitor moved first and took him out.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo said, “So the traitor knew about this plan as well.”<br/>
<br/>
Wen Ruanyu replied, “The Golden Swallow Trident’s existence has long been known among the upper ranks. In fact, it serves as a symbol of hope, a way to steady morale and inspire confidence.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo clapped his hands. “In that case, why don’t we use it to lay a trap?”<br/>
<br/>
“If we waste time chasing leads all over the city, it’ll not only be dangerous, but if the enemy floods us with fake clues, we’ll be running in circles. Isn’t that exactly what they want?”<br/>
<br/>
“Rather than let them run us ragged, we should stay put and cast a net. Let them come to us!”<br/>
<br/>
Wen Ruanyu was convinced. He nodded slightly. “You make a good point.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo said, “But before anything else, move me into the Vigorous Yang Manor.”<br/>
<br/>
Recently, too many human men had been taken into the Hidden Yang Manor, and the place had grown loud and chaotic - completely unsuitable for cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
“That’s easy enough!” Wen Ruanyu agreed at once.<br/>
<br/>
In truth, with his current status as Vice City Lord, Ning Zhuo could have arranged it himself without any trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Soon after, he was relocated smoothly to the Vigorous Yang Manor.<br/>
<br/>
The temperature there was noticeably higher than the rest of the city.<br/>
<br/>
Deep underground lay a pool of Fire Essence.<br/>
<br/>
The main hall was called the Sunfire Temple. Behind it stood the Rising Sun Stele, and at the center of the front courtyard towered the Golden Crow Pillar, a blazing column that seemed to prop up the heavens.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s new residence was uniformly called the Hearthflame Quarters, and many of the furnishings were made from Fire Jade.<br/>
<br/>
The atmosphere, however, was far from friendly.<br/>
<br/>
That very afternoon, while taking a walk, Ning Zhuo was cornered in the back garden.<br/>
<br/>
“You. Heard you were personally placed here by Lord Wen?”<br/>
<br/>
“Quite the connections, huh? But don’t get ahead of yourself.”<br/>
<br/>
“I’m destined to be the master of the Golden Swallow Trident!”<br/>
<br/>
The one threatening him was Zuo Han, a cultivator whose left eye gleamed with a cold, silvery light like moonlight. His expression was stern and unyielding.<br/>
<br/>
Just as Ning Zhuo was about to respond, someone darted out from behind an ornamental rock.<br/>
<br/>
It was Yang Weida - an old acquaintance, someone from the same village.<br/>
<br/>
Grinning, Yang Weida bowed and scraped before Zuo Han, doing his best to smooth things over for Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
“Jiao Ma, you’ve finally risen up the ranks!”<br/>
<br/>
“That’s great news!”<br/>
<br/>
“We’re the same kind, aren’t we? We should be helping each other, showing all those old bastards who tried to keep us down. Let them watch with their beady old eyes as we succeed.”<br/>
<br/>
Then he looked intently at Ning Zhuo. “You finished the medicine I sold you, right? Want some more?”<br/>
<br/>
“That won’t be necessary,” Ning Zhuo said flatly, turning away without another word. He had no interest in getting tangled up with Yang Weida.<br/>
<br/>
He had cultivation to do.<br/>
<br/>
When it came to soul refinement, Ning Zhuo remained tireless in his practice.<br/>
<br/>
As for the trap they were laying around the Golden Swallow Trident, Wen Ruanyu had taken full charge.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, content to let things unfold, had become a hands-off overseer and was enjoying a period of relative peace.<br/>
<br/>
Until a certain girl arrived - and shattered that peace entirely.<br/>
<br/>
Her skin had a bluish tint, with dark green spiral markings at her joints. On her elbows and knees, patches of skin had hardened into scale-like keratin.<br/>
<br/>
Two short, spiral horns rose from her brow, like twin bronze sickles.<br/>
<br/>
She wore tight-fitting leather armor that accentuated her curves - full chest, shapely hips, and a slim waist that emphasized the exaggerated arc of her silhouette.<br/>
<br/>
The girl came straight to him, locking eyes with Ning Zhuo, her gaze intense and burning. “Little Ma, you still love me, don’t you?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo immediately understood - this must be Qing Chi, the daughter of Qing Qan. She was the ghost-tribe girl who’d once been in love with Jiao Ma.<br/>
<br/>
His head throbbed. He shook it, expression cold. “What’s the point in talking about love now? Just leave. And don’t come back. From now on, let’s pretend we never met.”<br/>
<br/>
The girl stepped back, her face pale. Clutching her chest, she looked utterly devastated. “Little Ma… how could you be so cruel? Your words cut like knives!”<br/>
<br/>
“I don’t believe you!” she cried, shaking her head. Her eyes, equal parts desperate and resolute, bore into Ning Zhuo’s. “You still love me. You’re just lying to yourself!”<br/>
