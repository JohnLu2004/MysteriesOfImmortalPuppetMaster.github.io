<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 570: Flying Armor Pierces the Clouds</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Across the vast, endless expanse of the flat, frozen tundra, Frost Howl Valley stretched like a colossal gash, torn open by an ancient Dragon God in the earth itself.<br/>
<br/>
This enormous rift extended for three thousand seven hundred li, so narrow in places it could scarcely allow three people to walk side by side, yet expanding to a staggering width of over eighty li at its broadest point. Its sides were sheer walls of ice rising tens of thousands of zhang.<br/>
<br/>
All the ice within the valley was composed of Eternal Silence Black Ice, an exceptionally dangerous material.<br/>
<br/>
Approaching noon, sunlight pierced through the frost-laden mist within the valley, refracting brilliantly against the icy walls into countless dazzling prisms. As Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo soared above on their Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon, the entire canyon appeared like the glistening spine of an immense dragon, emanating a bone-chilling yet breathtaking splendor.<br/>
<br/>
Eternal Silence Black Ice absorbed sound itself, turning Frost Howl Valley into a graveyard of echoes.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, even Eternal Silence Black Ice had its limits. Whenever the absorbed sounds exceeded its threshold, the ice would violently rupture, unleashing ferocious waves of sonic blasts.<br/>
<br/>
Such chained explosions created unimaginably terrifying sonic tsunamis, capable of instantly triggering devastating blizzards. Each occurrence spelled certain death, entombing everything beneath endless snow. This was the unique and lethal phenomenon of Frost Howl Valley.<br/>
<br/>
Still, life always found a way to thrive amidst danger.<br/>
<br/>
Within this perilous place, Ice Soul Wolves and Furred Mammoths thrived, forming the two dominant clans that ruled its frozen depths.<br/>
<br/>
"One day, I’ll venture into this valley and explore it thoroughly," Sun Lingtong declared enthusiastically, eyes shining brightly with anticipation. "It must be incredibly thrilling."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded thoughtfully, "I’m equally intrigued by its mysteries, but we’d better wait until I advance further in my cultivation."<br/>
<br/>
Without lingering further, the two quickly returned inside the Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon and resumed their journey.<br/>
<br/>
They refrained from immediately slipping into the void, instead carefully scouting the surroundings of Frost Howl Valley, verifying their current location against their collected maps. This cautious approach not only helped recalibrate their direction but also rewarded them with an updated, accurate map.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo proceeded into his cultivation chamber, commencing practice of the Five Organ Temple Divine Art.<br/>
<br/>
Fire Cremation Prajna Unbinding Sutra<br/>
<br/>
Flames quietly surged, controlled and guided by Ning Zhuo as they danced and coiled around him.<br/>
<br/>
Sitting cross-legged in pure white robes, a serene, Buddha-like glow enveloped his face.<br/>
<br/>
Unusually, Sun Lingtong joined him, forsaking his usual position in the Dragon’s Head Chamber.<br/>
<br/>
With decisive precision, Ning Zhuo sliced open his own flesh and extracted a kidney.<br/>
<br/>
Demonic Blood Vein Technique!<br/>
<br/>
Blood tendons materialized mid-air, forming a tangled, blood-red mass, temporarily serving the kidney’s function.<br/>
<br/>
His kidney rapidly melted within the flames. With practiced efficiency, Ning Zhuo introduced the Ten-Thousand-Year Water Essence at the critical moment.<br/>
<br/>
The water essence merged seamlessly with the kidney, transforming into a radiant sphere of light.<br/>
<br/>
Within the sphere appeared a miniature temple housing an exquisitely detailed statue - a precise likeness of Ning Zhuo himself.<br/>
<br/>
Divine Sense: Object Retrieval!<br/>
<br/>
Using his spiritual sense, Ning Zhuo effortlessly guided the radiant sphere back into its rightful position within his body. As the light reoccupied the kidney’s original spot, the makeshift organ formed by the Demonic Blood Tendon Technique dissolved, having fulfilled its purpose.<br/>
<br/>
After successfully forging his Water Element Kidney Temple, Ning Zhuo pressed forward without rest, quickly completing the Wood Element Liver Temple.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, all five Elemental Organ Temples of the Divine Art were complete!<br/>
<br/>
"Now, I have mastered all five elements."<br/>
<br/>
"From this day onward, by simply channeling my spiritual sense into these temples and manifesting myself through their statues, I can significantly amplify any elemental spell and precisely control their power, overcoming my previous limitations."<br/>
<br/>
A surge of joy filled Ning Zhuo's heart.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong quietly celebrated his brother’s achievement with sincere happiness. Seeing Ning Zhuo close his eyes to recuperate, he gently left to take his post in the Dragon’s Head Chamber.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo tested each Elemental Temple by channeling his divine consciousness, savoring the deep satisfaction of mastering his creation.<br/>
<br/>
Although this spell was his own innovation, it originated from the profound Five Organ Temple Divine Technique - core cultivation method of the Five Elements Divine Lord, harmonizing the essence of heaven and earth, deeply infused with universal truths.<br/>
<br/>
Leveraging his exceptional understanding of the Five Elements, Ning Zhuo had managed significant improvements.<br/>
<br/>
This powerful spell required immense resources: the genuine essences of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth - all no younger than ten thousand years, resulting in astronomical costs. Yet its effectiveness was unmatched, proven by Ning Zhuo’s remarkable performance using just three elements during his time in Two Note Kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
"The crucial foundation is still the Fire Cremation Prajna Unbinding Sutra."<br/>
<br/>
"Without this Buddhist method, even if others learned my Five Organ Temple Divine Art and gathered all necessary elemental essences, they would fail utterly."<br/>
<br/>
"Indeed… the Demonic Blood Tendon Technique played a significant role too."<br/>
<br/>
"It temporarily replaces internal organs with condensed blood tendons, somewhat resembling the methods of the Demon Heart Cavern master."<br/>
<br/>
The Demon Heart Cavern Master from Six Cavern Sect could cultivate multiple Demon Hearts, each capable of sacrificing itself to save his life, rendering even powerful divine abilities like Scarlet Heart Homing Arrow ineffective.<br/>
<br/>
"And his son, Lin You, is currently in my grasp."<br/>
<br/>
"He practices the same demonic art as his father."<br/>
<br/>
"If I get the chance in the future, I'll interrogate him thoroughly about this demonic technique. Comparing it closely with my Demonic Blood Vein Technique will greatly assist my upcoming cultivation within my lower dantian Essence Sea."<br/>
<br/>
Thinking to this point, Ning Zhuo slowly opened his eyes and drew out a flower bud from his robe.<br/>
<br/>
The once vividly red flower bud had grown noticeably duller and more translucent.<br/>
<br/>
Holding the palm-sized flower bud, Ning Zhuo could plainly observe Lin You, tightly sealed within, along with a mechanical carriage compartment.<br/>
<br/>
"Without a continual supply of troops, the flower bud's seal will gradually weaken until it finally dissipates," Ning Zhuo mused aloud. "But it matters little."<br/>
<br/>
"Lin You's condition is far worse. Sealed layer upon layer and without nourishment for so long, he'll surely faint from hunger first."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo patiently awaited this moment.<br/>
<br/>
The flower bud originated from the Red Flower Dharma Avatar. After capturing Lin You alive on the battlefield, Mu Lan immediately passed this flower bud to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from this one, there was another flower bud, similarly handed to Ning Zhuo at that time, sealing Wu Hen.<br/>
<br/>
Unsealing these flower buds would be straightforward for Ning Zhuo, yet he refrained, wary of the potential mischief from the captives inside once freed.<br/>
<br/>
There was no need to rush; a little patience posed no harm.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, Ning Zhuo took no risks, keeping the seals intact rather than interrogating his prisoners immediately.<br/>
<br/>
Having successfully cultivated the Five Organ Temple Divine Technique, Ning Zhuo quickly transitioned to his next task: designing mechanical battle puppets.<br/>
<br/>
During this period, he poured intense mental effort into conceptualizing a new body for Yuan Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
His first thought revolved around Yuan Dasheng's Immortal Talent - the Golden Righteous Bones. Finding a compatible metal vessel was vital.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, he considered engraving specific techniques into the design, forming powerful restrictions to bolster defense comprehensively. The Diamond Sutra and the Demonic Golden Blood Armor Art were his current choices.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, employing Black Gold Meteorite Iron paired with Blood Jade Marrow would create armor capable of self-restoration - a critical feature given the considerable strain exerted when invoking Yuan Dasheng's Golden Righteous Bones.<br/>
<br/>
Yuan Dasheng's purpose differed from Meng Yehu's. Ning Zhuo intended him as a personal bodyguard, skillful in close-quarter combat and perfect for protection.<br/>
<br/>
Hence, Yuan Dasheng's primary strength lay in defense.<br/>
<br/>
Activating his Golden Righteous Bones would generate extraordinary defensive prowess. Therefore, Ning Zhuo's present concepts all aimed at enhancing synergy with this Immortal talent.<br/>
<br/>
Finding the ideal metal demanded extensive experimentation.<br/>
<br/>
The choice between engraving the Diamond Sutra or Demonic Golden Blood Armor Art arose from historical records indicating two supreme figures possessing Golden Righteous Bones who had respectively cultivated these two techniques.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, both techniques had long circulated, with various editions available in the Ten Thousand Books Pavilion. Acquiring and engraving them was straightforward.<br/>
<br/>
The third concept emphasized self-repair, essential due to the severe depletion inflicted upon the vessel when activating the Golden Righteous Bones. Post-battle automatic restoration would be exceptionally beneficial.<br/>
<br/>
Designing Yuan Dasheng's new body was still in the preliminary conceptual stage, with much work ahead. Ning Zhuo found it challenging and marveled retrospectively at his good fortune when initially crafting Meng Yehu.<br/>
<br/>
Conversely, designing the lower half of the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor was significantly simpler. With an existing prototype as a reference, Ning Zhuo’s direction was clearer.<br/>
<br/>
Three main ideas emerged:<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, using Bodhi Wood for biomimetic legs, overlaid with Demon Suppressing Chainmail. Embedding the Guanyin Moonlight Ring at the knees would enhance speed, while the feet utilized the Bitter Cold Sutra.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, crafting robust legs from Barbaric Elephant Bones, directly fusing the Dark Iron Pagoda Armor and mechanical torso, engraved internally with the True Travel Diagram of the Five Peaks. Feet embedded with formations could trigger the Giant Elephant Stomp power, inspired by Elephant King Xiang Yue.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, abandoning legs entirely in favor of a Lotus Pedestal embedded with defensive arrays. Engraved with the Eight Divisions Heavenly Dragon Incantation, activating the formation would summon eight heavenly dragon phantoms swiftly and agilely carrying the pedestal.<br/>
<br/>
Several days later.<br/>
<br/>
The Ten Thousand Li Traversing Dragon once more emerged from the void, orienting itself carefully in the tangible world.<br/>
<br/>
A refreshing breeze swept from distant mountains, caressing the faces of Sun and Ning.<br/>
<br/>
Large clouds drifted leisurely across the sky, leaving scattered openings where sunlight cascaded down, glistening on icy patches and melting snow.<br/>
<br/>
Green grass had begun blanketing the hillsides, dotted with spiritual sheep resembling flawless white jade, leisurely grazing.<br/>
<br/>
An eagle’s piercing cry drew Sun and Ning's gaze skyward.<br/>
<br/>
Far off, a golden-feathered Mystic Eagle streaked through the clouds like an arrow piercing the veil of mist, flickering in and out of sight.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong handed Ning Zhuo a jade slip containing their map. "We should now be near the Flying Cloud Kingdom's border."<br/>
<br/>
This map was provided by Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded in agreement, confirming Sun Lingtong’s assessment. "According to our itinerary, we'll arrive at the Ghostly Black Marsh in one more day."<br/>
Blackwater Mountain and White Paper City were nestled within this vast marshy wetland.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong explained, "The Ghostly Black Marsh lies between the Northern Wind Kingdom and the Flying Cloud Kingdom, acting as a neutral buffer zone outside both kingdoms' jurisdiction. Although we've traveled using the Ten Thousand Li Dragon without utilizing teleportation formations from the various immortal cities, leaving no traces behind, we still cannot afford to show our original faces here. Who knows if those Heaven and Earth Twin Ghosts are still trailing us."<br/>
<br/>
The Soul Devouring Sect was a mighty faction. Even though Sun and Ning had reached this place, any leakage of their true appearances or movements would inevitably alert the sect.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded thoughtfully, "Ghostly Black Marsh teems with spirits, making it an ideal cultivation ground for ghost and soul cultivators. The Soul Devouring Sect surely has their arrangements here."<br/>
<br/>
"Exactly right, boss," Sun Lingtong chuckled, "we'll follow your lead. My thief techniques can alter our appearances, and ever since absorbing the Evil God's bone marrow, my abilities have considerably improved."<br/>
<br/>
"We should disguise ourselves first, then, instead of directly heading into White Paper City. We can stroll around nearby towns to adapt and investigate. Ideally, we'd blend in as locals."<br/>
<br/>
"Exactly!" Ning Zhuo eagerly agreed. "Our next destination is the Ghostly Black Marsh. Here, boss, this mechanism armor I've crafted is perfect for you."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo produced a new Sky-Iron Heroic Armor.<br/>
<br/>
The entire puppet armor was compact and precisely suited Sun Lingtong's physique.<br/>
<br/>
"Wow!!!" Sun Lingtong’s eyes shone brightly, and he immediately embraced the armor with open arms.<br/>
<br/>
Ever since their time in Two Note Kingdom, Sun Lingtong had incessantly pleaded with Ning Zhuo to make him his own mechanical battle armor. Whether it was the new Sky-Iron Heroic Armor or the Hundred-Armed Arhat Armor, Sun Lingtong had been incredibly envious.<br/>
<br/>
During their arduous journey, Ning Zhuo had pondered deeply, eventually creating a unique mechanical armor for Sun Lingtong using his crafting station.<br/>
<br/>
"Oh right, boss, I've even designed a startup slogan for you," Ning Zhuo added proudly, clearly awaiting praise.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong eagerly leaned in to listen.<br/>
<br/>
After memorizing the phrase, Sun Lingtong immediately channeled his spiritual energy, connected through his divine sense, and excitedly shouted, "Golden Swallow Cuts the Clouds; Heroic Armor, Wrap My Body!"<br/>
<br/>
Instantly, the Sky-Iron Heroic Armor disassembled in response.<br/>
<br/>
First, the Five Element Golden Core disc spun out, adhering firmly to Sun Lingtong's chest.<br/>
<br/>
Next, a mechanical spine clung tightly to his back.<br/>
<br/>
Twelve Divine Mirrors simultaneously shot forth silver beams.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong stretched his arms straight as the gauntlets smoothly slid into place, guided by the silver beams.<br/>
<br/>
Around his abdomen, Evergreen Formation belts wrapped like green serpents, encircling his waist three times before emitting an emerald glow, swiftly enveloping his body in a thin protective membrane.<br/>
<br/>
Clank-clank-clank!<br/>
<br/>
Chest plates, leg guards, and even the golden wings rapidly assembled, tightening seamlessly around Sun Lingtong’s body.<br/>
<br/>
Within merely three breaths, Sun Lingtong was fully encased within the Sky-Iron Heroic Armor.<br/>
<br/>
He lightly tapped his foot, and flames erupted from the Li-Fire formation under his boots, propelling him skyward like a firecracker.<br/>
<br/>
"Wow! Amazing! Incredible!"<br/>
<br/>
"I’m so handsome, so utterly handsome!"<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong clumsily soared through the sky, zigzagging up and down, excitedly shouting and cheering without restraint.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo watched him with a satisfied smile, his heart brimming with joy.<br/>
<br/>
"Little Zhuo, join me!" Sun Lingtong called out enthusiastically.<br/>
<br/>
"Coming," Ning Zhuo nodded.<br/>
<br/>
He summoned his own Sky-Iron Heroic Armor, and within moments, he flew up to join Sun Lingtong, flying side by side.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong suddenly challenged, "Little Zhuo, let’s race!"<br/>
<br/>
Without waiting, flames burst from his hands and feet, instantly boosting his speed as he shot forward.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shouted angrily in protest, "Boss, you're cheating again!"<br/>
<br/>
Nonetheless, he activated his armor’s maximum thrust, swiftly pursuing.<br/>
<br/>
High above, the two darted through the clouds, vigorously chasing each other, laughing heartily. Their playful pursuit scattered clouds wildly and startled the soaring golden eagles into frantic cries as they fled chaotically into the distance.</div>
