<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
On the very first night, a male consort was killed - and not just any consort, but one of the most powerful among them.<br/>
<br/>
Though Wen Ruanyu was shocked and furious, the incident rekindled his hope of rooting out the traitor. He sought out Ning Zhuo and invited him to accompany him.<br/>
<br/>
"Jiao Ma, your strategy is working. Just one night in, and the traitor was forced to make a move."<br/>
<br/>
But Ning Zhuo remained calm and shook his head slightly.<br/>
<br/>
"Let’s investigate first. We can't jump to conclusions."<br/>
<br/>
Would a traitor really strike on the first night?<br/>
<br/>
If it truly was the traitor, then he must have acted with absolute confidence in his methods.<br/>
<br/>
But if not, then any investigation at this point would miss the real target.<br/>
<br/>
Wen Ruanyu noticed Ning Zhuo’s unshaken demeanor and paused.<br/>
<br/>
"Jiao Ma, it sounds like you have a different take?"<br/>
<br/>
"I'm not optimistic," Ning Zhuo replied frankly, and laid out his reasoning in full.<br/>
<br/>
Wen Ruanyu was surprised again, then sighed.<br/>
<br/>
"Your face may be different, but this calm, clear-headed way you respond - it really reminds me of Senior Sister Meng."<br/>
<br/>
This time, it was Ning Zhuo whose expression faltered.<br/>
<br/>
But Wen Ruanyu didn’t notice. He tilted his head back with a long sigh.<br/>
<br/>
"These days, I’ve been thinking about Senior Sister Meng a lot. It must be from the pressure of this ghost tide weighing me down."<br/>
<br/>
"Especially after Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer was killed… I’ve been full of doubt and forced to think about every possibility."<br/>
<br/>
"So I keep asking myself: If Senior Sister Meng were still here, what would she do? Back then she didn’t have any diviners supporting her either - so how was she always so wise, so decisive?"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo offered a few words of comfort. Then, feigning casual interest, he said:<br/>
<br/>
"Senior Wen, you’re different from the people of this city. You're from the Myriad Manifestations Sect."<br/>
<br/>
"If White Paper Immortal City really falls, even if you retreat, the sect wouldn't hold it against you."<br/>
<br/>
Wen Ruanyu gave him a long look, then shook his head with a bitter smile.<br/>
<br/>
"You don’t understand. I’ve been stationed in this city for many years now."<br/>
<br/>
"At first, I was only here because of Senior Sister Meng’s orders. But over time, my attachment to this place deepened. I couldn’t bring myself to leave."<br/>
<br/>
"You may not know this, but the city lord's true body is ailing. Even though she has paper clones, she doesn’t show herself unless it’s something truly serious."<br/>
<br/>
"Normally, I handle internal affairs in the city, while Tie Guzheng oversees its defenses."<br/>
<br/>
"Much of the city’s infrastructure was based on my ideas - or built with my own hands."<br/>
<br/>
"Take the Ink Pool, for example. It was indeed Senior Sister Meng’s design, but over the years it’s broken down more than ten times. Every time, I was the one who organized repairs and upgrades."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was curious.<br/>
<br/>
"I'm no Confucian cultivator, but I’ve read a bit. Is the Ink Pool really that fragile?"<br/>
<br/>
Wen Ruanyu shared the hidden truth.<br/>
<br/>
"There’s a saying - ‘the land shapes the people.’ The ghost clans have lived and bred in this region for generations. Their nature is shadowy, combative - more like savages than anything else. In the beginning, they were impossible to manage. Peaceful coexistence with the human race was out of the question."<br/>
<br/>
"What you see today - the social structure of White Paper Immortal City and the ghostfolk villages across this mist-laden marshland - it's all thanks to the Ink Pool."<br/>
<br/>
"We altered the composition of the Ink Pool's waters, turning it into the main drinking source for the city and surrounding settlements."<br/>
<br/>
"Over time, that water infused the ghostfolk with a sense of culture. Their violent instincts dulled. They became gentler, more refined. Only then could we open schools and academies, teach them language and knowledge, and help them flourish."<br/>
<br/>
"Of course, the ghostfolk resisted. For a long time, they tried every means to sabotage the Ink Pool - and they succeeded, more than once."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo listened intently, a new question forming in his mind.<br/>
<br/>
"Then... before Senior Meng came to this city, it must have looked very different?"<br/>
<br/>
Wen Ruanyu nodded without hesitation.<br/>
<br/>
"Absolutely."<br/>
<br/>
"When I first followed her here, it was a desolate place. Barely inhabited. The ambient yin energy was overwhelming - almost like the underworld itself. And the ghost tides made it even worse. What sane cultivator would willingly settle here?"<br/>
<br/>
"Humans made up the bulk of the population. Ghostfolk were few, and due to their cruel, violent nature, they were watched closely - most of them lived as slaves."<br/>
<br/>
"Senior Sister Meng was born with a compassionate heart. She treated all beings with equal respect. That’s what I admired most about her."<br/>
<br/>
"Not long after she arrived, she assessed the situation and told us she had a plan to revitalize the city."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s eyes lit up.<br/>
<br/>
"She planned to use the power of the ghostfolk?"<br/>
<br/>
Wen Ruanyu chuckled.<br/>
<br/>
"Exactly."<br/>
<br/>
"The ghostfolk are half-yin, half-yang - perfectly attuned to this marshland."<br/>
<br/>
"They’re far better suited to life here than humans. They can even enter the Netherworld Flood Dragon River and explore the underworld itself."<br/>
<br/>
"But their numbers and strength were kept tightly suppressed by human cultivators. And there weren’t enough humans here to govern the region on their own. Senior Sister Meng saw that as a tremendous waste."<br/>
<br/>
"So she consulted us, and ultimately chose a Confucian path - establishing the Ink Pool to civilize the ghostfolk. To free them from their savage ways and make them the true backbone of this land’s governance."<br/>
<br/>
A surge of admiration rose in Ning Zhuo’s heart. “This Senior Meng… she’s incredible. ‘The water shapes the people,’ and she actually changed the water to reshape the culture of this entire region. That kind of foresight and vision truly commands respect.”<br/>
<br/>
He turned to Wen Ruanyu. “But of course, without your perseverance and dedication, Senior Wen, there would be no such success in civilizing White Paper Immortal City.”<br/>
<br/>
Wen Ruanyu was clearly pleased, both by Ning Zhuo’s reverence for Meng Yaoyin and his praise of himself. “It’s precisely thanks to the long-term influence of the Ink Pool that we were able to gradually loosen our restrictions on the ghostkin. We supported them, encouraged their growth, and employed them as the primary labor force to build up this shadowy, damp marshland.”<br/>
<br/>
“I oversaw city governance, and deliberately developed a network of villages and towns around the city. Each one is rooted in a few human cultivators, with the majority of the population being ghostkin.”<br/>
<br/>
“Today, our sphere of influence spans forty percent of the marshland.”<br/>
<br/>
“This time, when White Paper Immortal City faced the threat of destruction, the City Lord gave a single command - and so many forces rushed to our aid. I can’t deny I felt deeply gratified.”<br/>
<br/>
“Granted, some of that is due to the generous rewards offered by the City Lord. But it also proves that our teachings have truly taken root. Human or ghostkin alike, their hearts are aligned with White Paper Immortal City.”<br/>
<br/>
This conversation gave Ning Zhuo a much deeper understanding of the city's history.<br/>
<br/>
While they talked, the two had already arrived at the scene of the incident.<br/>
<br/>
Shen Bing’s body still lay where it had fallen, intentionally left undisturbed.<br/>
<br/>
Wen Ruanyu looked to Ning Zhuo. The latter extended his hand in a polite gesture for him to proceed.<br/>
<br/>
Wen Ruanyu then activated a detection spell. The results came quickly.<br/>
<br/>
“Shen Bing suffered two fatal wounds,” he reported.<br/>
<br/>
“One at the neck, the other at the heart.”<br/>
<br/>
“Though his neck appears intact, with no visible trauma, all vital force has been severed - effectively, a beheading.”<br/>
<br/>
“As for his chest, there’s a Black Iron Piercing Needle embedded straight through the heart. That too would’ve been lethal.”<br/>
<br/>
Noticing the change in Wen Ruanyu’s expression, Ning Zhuo’s heart stirred. “Senior Wen, you seem to have a suspicion already?”<br/>
<br/>
Wen Ruanyu sighed. “Yes.”<br/>
<br/>
“These strange injuries immediately made me think of Chen Sui’s Harvest Slash technique.”<br/>
<br/>
“And the Black Iron Piercing Needle is a well-known weapon of Sun Tiesheng.”<br/>
<br/>
Shen Bing, Chen Sui, and Sun Tiesheng - those three were the strongest cultivators of the Vigorous Yang Manor. Now Shen Bing was dead, and all clues pointed squarely at Chen Sui and Sun Tiesheng. This conclusion left Wen Ruanyu visibly unsettled.<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, Ning Zhuo too was silent.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, Wen Ruanyu broke the silence with a bitter sigh. “You know, I don’t even dare to let those two walk through the Plain Inquiry: Heart-Piercing Volume.”<br/>
<br/>
That scripture could determine whether someone was lying, and once detected, would sever their life force. It was a fearsome thing.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo let out a breath. “I strongly suspect this is the work of the mole, manipulating things from the shadows.”<br/>
<br/>
“This is a layered trap.”<br/>
<br/>
“Chen Sui and Sun Tiesheng may have been compromised, pushed into acting.”<br/>
<br/>
“If our investigation confirms that, wouldn’t we be forced to punish them? Life for a life is the simplest solution.”<br/>
<br/>
“But if we do that, we’re playing right into the mole’s hands - he’ll have used us to eliminate Chen Sui and Sun Tiesheng.”<br/>
<br/>
“If we don’t, how will the people accept it?”<br/>
<br/>
“So no matter what we choose, it will shake morale and fracture unity within White Paper Immortal City.”<br/>
<br/>
Wen Ruanyu nodded. “I have no proof, but I agree with your judgment, Jiao Ma.”<br/>
<br/>
“After clashing with this mole a few times, I’ve grown increasingly impressed.”<br/>
<br/>
“His strength and cunning are both top-tier.”<br/>
<br/>
“Jin Yangzi is dead, and now Shen Bing too. If we end up executing Chen Sui and Sun Tiesheng, Vigorous Yang Manor will be gutted.”<br/>
<br/>
“That would devastate its morale.”<br/>
<br/>
After saying this, both men fell silent once again.<br/>
<br/>
The mole’s tactics were too effective. Even knowing there might be a lead, they didn’t dare pursue it.<br/>
<br/>
Because both of them had to consider the bigger picture.<br/>
<br/>
To investigate further would be to harm their own side.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo clapped his hands softly in admiration. “We tried to pressure him with the Golden Swallow Trident and the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord’s grand strategy. Seems the mole saw right through it - and now he’s using the same tactics, turning them back on us.”<br/>
<br/>
“Incredible. Just incredible.”<br/>
<br/>
Wen Ruanyu frowned. “So what should we do now?”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo paused for a moment, then opened his hands. “We wait and keep still. To launch an investigation rashly would be handing weapons to the enemy.”<br/>
<br/>
“But we still hold the initiative.”<br/>
<br/>
“As long as the Spirit Contract Treasure Refining Formation stays in place, the Forgetful River Prefecture Lord will keep pressing the traitor on his end.”<br/>
<br/>
“For now, we tighten our surveillance on Chen Sui and Sun Tiesheng. I refuse to believe he can keep acting without leaving a single flaw.”<br/>
<br/>
Wen Ruanyu considered this for a moment, then gave a helpless smile. “That’s all we can do.”<br/>
<br/>
Chen Sui’s residence.<br/>
<br/>
“What?!” Chen Sui’s eyes widened in fury. He tore the flying message in half and roared, “Who’s mimicking my Harvest Slash Technique to frame me?!”<br/>
<br/>
“Shen Bing is dead. My biggest rival for the Golden Swallow Trident is gone. That only leaves Sun Tiesheng - he must be the one behind this!”<br/>
<br/>
“The Sun clan… of course. A vast clan with deep resources, while I’m just a lone cultivator. They had the method prepared, and even someone trained to use it.”<br/>
<br/>
“The Black Iron Piercing Needle I stole was left in Shen Bing’s body. When is Wen Ruanyu planning to arrest Sun Tiesheng?”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Tiesheng’s residence.<br/>
<br/>
After hearing the report, Sun Tiesheng slammed the table and bellowed, “Curse that Chen Sui! That Black Iron Piercing Needle - I'll never forget - I lost it right after sparring with him!”<br/>
<br/>
“And now my clan’s preparation, even down to having an elder practice the Harvest Slash Technique, has given him the chance to sow confusion.”<br/>
<br/>
“Tell the clan to come up with another plan!”<br/>
<br/>
“Right now, in the entirety of Vigorous Yang Manor, only Chen Sui and I stand a real chance. If I claim the Golden Swallow Trident, I’ll repay the clan handsomely!”<br/>
<br/>
The servant hesitated. “My lord, Shen Bing just died. If we act now, it’ll look like we’re openly defying heaven’s will.”<br/>
<br/>
Sun Tiesheng laughed loudly, brimming with confidence. “Claiming the Golden Swallow Trident as one’s own isn't something just anyone can do. Jin Yangzi is dead, and now Shen Bing too - only Chen Sui is left, a solitary orphan.”<br/>
<br/>
“I’m the strongest contender now. White Paper Immortal City is facing ghost tides, and the Underworld Army is camped nearby, watching like tigers stalking prey. Do you think they dare move against me? Aren’t they afraid the Golden Swallow Trident will remain masterless?”<br/>
<br/>
Back at his quarters, Ning Zhuo returned to cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
With four Nascent Soul–level artifacts cycling in succession, the strength of his soul had surged to nearly 800,000 Man Soul - a meteoric rise.<br/>
<br/>
“Boss, you really don’t want to use this method to refine your soul? Once this chance is gone, it won’t come again,” Ning Zhuo couldn’t help trying again, reaching out to persuade Sun Lingtong through Life Hanging by a Thread.<br/>
<br/>
But Sun Lingtong declined without hesitation. “Little Zhuo, don’t bother. I’m stuck at the final step before reaching Golden Core. Once I break through, I’ll be ready to tackle this kind of bitter work!”<br/>
<br/>
“Hee hee.”<br/>
<br/>
“Look who’s here? Your little girlfriend.”<br/>
<br/>
As a master of the Life Hanging by a Thread technique, Ning Zhuo was naturally aware of Sun Lingtong’s surroundings.<br/>
<br/>
She was now within the ghost-soldier encampment, though positioned along the outer edge.<br/>
<br/>
Through Sun Lington’s eyes, Ning Zhuo saw a group of cultivators making a bold nighttime raid on the enemy camp. He couldn’t help but be impressed. These people had guts.<br/>
<br/>
“Follow me - charge!!!” Qing Yan led the charge at full gallop.<br/>
<br/>
His daughter Qing Chi followed close behind.<br/>
<br/>
Until now, White Paper Immortal City had only sent out small raiding teams to harass Forgetful River’s ghost army - never a full frontal assault like this.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, the ghost army was caught completely off guard by the sudden strike.<br/>
<br/>
By the time they gathered themselves and mounted a counterattack, Qing Yan’s group had already made their mark and retreated at leisure.<br/>
<br/>
At the rear, Qing Chi turned back and thrust out both palms, unleashing a surge of green flame.<br/>
<br/>
Under that fire, countless ghost soldiers screamed and perished.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this through Sun Lingtong’s eyes, Ning Zhuo was startled. “Your little girlfriend’s no pushover. That move alone is at the Golden Core level!”<br/>
<br/>
On the way back from their raid, Qing Chi whispered to her father through a voice transmission, “Dad, don’t forget - if I fight with all I’ve got, you have to support me in courting Jiao Ma!”<br/>
<br/>
Qing Yan gave a cold snort. “I said, you’d need to earn the merit first.”<br/>
<br/>
Qing Chi rubbed her fists, full of eagerness. “Just some merit? I’ll rack it up in no time!”<br/>
<br/>
That night, the Forgetful River’s ghost army passed the hours in anxious dread.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo spent the night immersed in tireless cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
Vigorous Yang Manor passed the night in uneasy peace - only for dawn to bring sudden chaos.<br/>
<br/>
“Someone’s dead! Someone’s dead!”<br/>
<br/>
Chen Sui was dead.</div>
