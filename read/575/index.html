<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The Bone Crocodile Demon, encircled protectively by the Piercing Bone Crocodiles, dove deeper and deeper into the gloomy depths of the Underworld Flood Dragon River. The darkness grew increasingly oppressive as they descended, and a sense of foreboding swelled within the Bone Crocodile Demon's heart. Many Piercing Bone Crocodiles around him struggled, unable to endure the unnatural depth forced upon them.<br/>
<br/>
Piercing Bone Crocodiles weren't creatures adapted for deep dives; it was only through the Bone Crocodile Demon's direct control that they managed to reach such a depth. After another stretch, the demon spotted a swirling vortex of Yin energy ahead.<br/>
<br/>
Inside this whirlpool were countless water ghosts piled densely upon one another, forming a bizarre and eerie formation. Unfazed, the Bone Crocodile Demon communicated telepathically, his tone uneasy: "Strategist Xie, we failed our mission. How shall we report this to our master?"<br/>
<br/>
From within the formation, the cold voice of Xie Sichao responded: "We nearly succeeded, but Wen Ruanyu's sudden appearance thwarted our plans."<br/>
<br/>
"Hold on…" Xie Sichao suddenly paused.<br/>
<br/>
After several breaths, he continued, "How strange."<br/>
<br/>
"What's strange?" the Bone Crocodile Demon asked.<br/>
<br/>
"News from the river surface says Wen Ruanyu unexpectedly returned to the fleet, searching specifically for an outsider. He found one - a merchant named Yang Weida from Flying Cloud Kingdom - and took him personally."<br/>
<br/>
The Bone Crocodile Demon pondered, "Could this Yang Weida have some hidden background? Perhaps encountering Wen Ruanyu was merely our misfortune."<br/>
<br/>
Xie Sichao said slowly, "That's precisely the oddity. Wen Ruanyu clearly didn't recognize the merchant, and after capturing him, instead of returning immediately to White Paper City, he continued northward."<br/>
<br/>
The two speculated briefly but found no clear answers. Side by side, they descended even deeper.<br/>
<br/>
At a certain depth, the Bone Crocodile Demon suddenly heard a dragon’s roar. Instantly, the water around them vanished, replaced by a chilling, otherworldly space.<br/>
<br/>
At that moment, they had crossed from the realm of the living directly into the Underworld.<br/>
<br/>
Such was the unique nature of the Underworld Flood Dragon River. The flood dragon, originally from the Underworld, sought ascension through tribulation, enduring the ultimate Yang lightning. It was no ordinary flood dragon, as it possessed a divine title. Consequently, after transforming into the Underworld Flood Dragon River, it naturally linked the mortal world and the Underworld, serving as a bridge.<br/>
<br/>
Periodically, ghost tides engulfing the entire Ghostly Black Marshlands  used this very path to manifest.<br/>
<br/>
The Bone Crocodile Demon and Xie Sichao entered the Underworld together, stepping into a teleportation formation. The formation activated, transporting them instantly into a luxurious yet imposing mansion.<br/>
<br/>
"Greetings, Master!" they proclaimed in unison, kneeling respectfully in the grand hall after being led by an attendant.<br/>
<br/>
"Your servants have failed; we are guilty…" Xie Sichao, fulfilling his role as the strategist, explained the situation in detail.<br/>
<br/>
The Bone Crocodile Demon remained respectfully silent.<br/>
<br/>
Their mysterious master sat upon a grand throne, completely obscured by swirling black mist. After listening carefully, he paused thoughtfully before speaking with a heavy and resonant voice, "Wen Ruanyu is a disciple of the Myriad Manifestations Sect, formidable in strength. Your timely retreat was a wise decision."<br/>
<br/>
"When the enemy is stronger, retreating to preserve strength is basic warfare strategy. However, Wen Ruanyu’s actions were indeed unusual, prompted by a flying message from the Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer. This specter is the right-hand advisor to the White Paper City Lord and excels in divination."<br/>
<br/>
"This suggests that the Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer has foreseen something important."<br/>
<br/>
He paused briefly, then continued, "This ghost tide is the culmination of years of our meticulous preparation. To eliminate the White Paper City Lord and claim the immortal city, we must spare no effort and leave no openings for our enemy."<br/>
<br/>
"Since they have a divination master, we must also seek guidance."<br/>
<br/>
"Take my token and seek Ash Bone Elder in Water Burial Valley. Have him divine the correct course of action under these circumstances to eliminate any chance for the enemy to turn the tide."<br/>
<br/>
Both the Bone Crocodile Demon and Xie Sichao promptly accepted the mission. After departing from the mansion through another teleportation formation, they arrived swiftly at Water Burial Valley.<br/>
<br/>
Using the master’s token, they easily gained an audience with Ash Bone Elder.<br/>
<br/>
Ash Bone Elder’s eyes glittered like icy stars behind a mask crafted from gray bone, inscribed with countless characters representing his cultivation technique, the Six Yin Bone Inquiry Scripture.<br/>
<br/>
Receiving the token, Ash Bone Elder immediately began divination. He took out a ceramic urn filled with skeletal remains, then activated his mystical energy, slicing his fingertip to drip three drops of eerie, pale-green blood.<br/>
<br/>
As the blood touched the bones, a silent, cold flame ignited, burning the remains into fine ashes.<br/>
<br/>
Ash Bone Elder waved his hand, conjuring a chilling wind that swirled ominously around the spectral fire.<br/>
<br/>
The chilling wind swept up the bone ash, scattering it gently into the air.<br/>
<br/>
Ash Bone Elder murmured quietly, his fingers rapidly forming mystical hand seals, activating his cultivation technique.<br/>
<br/>
Bone Crocodile Demon and Xie Sichao stared intently, watching as the swirling bone ash gradually coalesced, taking shape into characters.<br/>
<br/>
They read closely: <br/>
<br/>
"Behead the ghostly maiden, the gates of the city open."<br/>
<br/>
"Burn the paper effigy, lure the evil forth."<br/>
<br/>
"Warm Jade splashes ink, staining the white scroll."<br/>
<br/>
"Myriad Manifestations..."<br/>
<br/>
At the next moment, Ash Bone Elder waved his sleeve abruptly, scattering the wind, letting the bone ash vanish into the air completely.<br/>
<br/>
"Ash Bone Elder, why did you stop the divination?" Bone Crocodile Demon asked with confusion.<br/>
<br/>
Xie Sichao shared the same puzzlement.<br/>
<br/>
Ash Bone Elder snorted softly. "Heavenly secrets cannot be revealed so lightly. Every act of divination costs more than merely precious materials and mystical energy - it also consumes my own fortune."<br/>
<br/>
"Divinations must never be done to completion. Revealing heaven's mysteries exhaustively harms my own fate greatly."<br/>
<br/>
"The favor I owe your master allows me only this far."<br/>
<br/>
"Now go," he commanded, waving his sleeve once more.<br/>
<br/>
Bone Crocodile Demon and Xie Sichao felt the world spin around them, and by the time they stabilized themselves, they discovered, astonished, they had been teleported directly to the entrance of Water Burial Valley.<br/>
<br/>
The two exchanged helpless glances and began discussing their predicament.<br/>
<br/>
"Is Ash Bone Elder at the Nascent Soul realm or perhaps even Soul Formation?"<br/>
<br/>
"It's hard to say. His cultivation has always been shrouded in mystery."<br/>
<br/>
"What shall we do next?"<br/>
<br/>
"Clearly, forcing entry into Water Burial Valley is impossible; we lack the strength. We can only report our current findings to our master."<br/>
<br/>
"But this prophecy..."<br/>
<br/>
"Don't worry. Though incomplete, it's sufficient. Didn't it instruct us to first eliminate Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer? Indeed, she poses a grave threat. Even better, if she has conducted divinations guiding Wen Ruanyu, her luck must currently be at a low point. It's the perfect moment to strike."<br/>
<br/>
They continued their discussions while heading back.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, at Listening Pavilion in White Paper City:<br/>
<br/>
This was Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer’s music chamber.<br/>
<br/>
Outside the window, the Ghostly Bamboo Forest lay still and silent. Even the bluish-green phosphorescent flames that typically danced among the bamboo had withdrawn deep into the thicket.<br/>
<br/>
The scent of decaying bamboo leaves seeped through the window cracks, permeating the music room.<br/>
<br/>
Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer gently adjusted the bronze wick of the lamp, and to her surprise, the clear, azure flame twisted suddenly into a human shape, writhing painfully.<br/>
<br/>
She furrowed her brow slightly, took a deep breath, stretched her fingers gracefully, and placed them delicately upon the strings, beginning the Funeral Melody.<br/>
<br/>
"Nine Springs Requiem."<br/>
<br/>
The first note resonated like spring water breaking through ice. The banners draping the chamber walls fluttered without wind. As the melody brushed past the bronze lamp, the contorted flame received immediate comfort and healing, ceasing its struggle and panting heavily.<br/>
<br/>
Outside, the silent bamboo forest stirred gently; even the rotting leaves regained some of their fresh green.<br/>
<br/>
The melody flowed continuously. By the sixth modulation, when the Shang note resounded, smoke from the incense burner condensed into a rare Udumbara flower, gently floating downward to rest between Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer’s brows. Her previously knitted eyebrows relaxed.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, when the seventh modulation reached the Jiao note, the human-shaped flame dispersed, returning to normal. The bamboo grove swayed softly, more of the decayed leaves reviving their original color.<br/>
<br/>
As the melody approached its climax with the Zhi note, the flame became round and radiant, emanating warmth. The bamboo forest swayed contentedly, the scent of decay nearly undetectable. Smoke transformed into a sparse shower of Udumbara blossoms, bathing Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer softly.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, with a harsh twang, the zither string snapped.<br/>
<br/>
Countless hidden weapons shot abruptly from the depths of the bamboo grove.<br/>
<br/>
Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer felt a sharp pain in her chest, blood surging upwards, which she forcefully swallowed back down.<br/>
<br/>
Her aura surged violently, activating her protective treasure garment. Her sleeves expanded and lengthened abruptly, transforming into billowing cloud sleeves.<br/>
<br/>
Cloud-like sleeves danced gracefully, effortlessly capturing and sealing away the incoming hidden weapons.<br/>
<br/>
From all directions, nine assassins burst forth simultaneously, shattering windows, breaking through walls, and smashing doors, converging upon Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer.<br/>
<br/>
A flash of panic flickered in Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer’s eyes. She had failed to properly heal her wounds, leaving her weakened - her fighting prowess reduced to less than thirty percent of its usual might.<br/>
<br/>
Facing imminent death, she instinctively reached into her robes to crush an emergency jade token. But at the very last second, she hesitated, deciding instead to pull out her backup instrument, a pipa. With a resounding and ripping note, she unleashed a powerful sonic wave.<br/>
<br/>
The wave surged outward with lethal sharpness, embodying Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer's desperate strength. The two leading assassins were sliced clean in half, their spilled viscera unnaturally dissolving into pools of foul, black liquid. From these sinister pools emerged ghostly, eight-legged spiders, continuing the assault.<br/>
<br/>
Leaping agilely onto a roof beam, Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer narrowly evaded a coordinated strike from the remaining seven assassins, though her protective artifact - a simple silver hairpin - shattered, causing a strand of dark hair to gently drift downward.<br/>
<br/>
With fierce determination, she bit the tip of her tongue and spat out a mouthful of vital blood onto the pipa. Immediately, crimson-gold mystical symbols flared to life on the instrument, as she unleashed the mournful yet devastating "Nine Springs Funeral Melody."<br/>
<br/>
Boom, boom, boom- <br/>
<br/>
The explosive sonic barrage swept across everything. All forty-eight bamboo curtains within the Listening Spirit Pavilion burst apart simultaneously, releasing clouds of dust and shockwaves that shook the entire structure.<br/>
<br/>
Such a massive disturbance immediately attracted the guards rushing to her aid.<br/>
<br/>
When the dust settled, only three assassins remained.<br/>
<br/>
They stared anxiously at Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer, who hovered defiantly mid-air, their courage completely shattered.<br/>
<br/>
"That Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer is truly formidable! We had carefully sabotaged her precious zither and her chambers, yet each lethal trap went unused, rendering all our careful arrangements meaningless."<br/>
<br/>
"More terrifyingly, she didn’t even crush her jade token to teleport away. Had she done so, the disrupted space would have shredded her into countless pieces."<br/>
<br/>
"Let's retreat. We've failed the primary mission, but there’s still a secondary target."<br/>
<br/>
The trio summoned clouds of black smoke, leaving behind a swarm of ghost spiders to cover their escape.<br/>
<br/>
As guards finally arrived and confirmed her safety, Sorrowful Melody Ghost Seer could no longer hold on, coughing up a large mouthful of blood before her strength failed completely.<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere, Commander Qing Yan’s three warships had already docked earlier. He personally led several male consorts, moving on foot toward the city gate.<br/>
<br/>
White Paper City shone entirely pale, its walls not of stone nor wood, but curiously akin to paper.<br/>
<br/>
The grand city gate stood impressively tall and thick, adorned with mystical inscriptions from the "Heavy Yin Tidewater Technique," emitting rhythmic, tide-like sounds.<br/>
<br/>
City guards primarily consisted of ghost clansmen, though their leaders and elites were humans. Their armor and weapons were uniquely crafted, resembling carefully folded white paper.<br/>
<br/>
"State your names," ordered the guard at the gate, a scholar cultivator holding a brush and book, cloaked in scholarly qi.<br/>
<br/>
Under Qing Yan’s guidance, Ning Zhuo and the others offered their names without incident. Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong felt mild apprehension, yet their false identities were smoothly recorded without suspicion.<br/>
<br/>
Upon entering, they encountered layered pavilions resembling pages of old manuscripts, wrinkled and smoothed repeatedly by invisible hands, and the scent of bookbinder’s bone glue wafted gently through cracked window frames.<br/>
<br/>
The white stone streets intermittently revealed faint ink stains and broken lines of poetry.<br/>
<br/>
Paper craftsmen eagerly called to passing crowds: "Come and look! Freshly crafted Yin Cloud Umbrellas to protect you from a quarter-hour's Ecstasy Rain!"<br/>
<br/>
The shops mostly sold paper umbrellas, but they also displayed paper weapons, figures, horses, and even houses.<br/>
<br/>
Alongside paper artisans, numerous stores specialized in selling talismans.<br/>
<br/>
Traversing Paper Craftsman Street, the group turned toward the Western Market, drawn by the lingering fragrance of ink.<br/>
<br/>
Ahead, they discovered an ink-black river sparkling with dark, glossy brilliance, dotted with countless paper boats of varying sizes. Elderly boatmen piloted canopy-covered paper boats using long bamboo poles, while boatwomen sang melodiously aboard brightly decorated paper pleasure boats.<br/>
<br/>
Qing Yan guided the group across four bridges, ever deeper into the heart of the city.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong marveled continuously at the city’s wondrous sights, having never witnessed such peculiar splendor firsthand.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji had merely instructed Ning Zhuo to visit this place, handing him a token without further elaboration.<br/>
<br/>
Though initially intending to gather intelligence, Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong found themselves whisked directly into the city due to their disguises as Jiao Ma and Iron Lump.<br/>
<br/>
Scanning the sprawling architecture, their attention was captured by several towering landmarks.<br/>
<br/>
One was an enormous paper effigy facing the southern gate. An abrupt explosion set it ablaze, fire roaring skyward.<br/>
<br/>
Another marvel was the Cloud Pavilion, floating majestically atop drifting clouds.<br/>
<br/>
Boom! Boom! Boom!<br/>
<br/>
A pitch-black tower radiated dense Yin energy, each of its seven eaves dangling thousands of brushes.<br/>
<br/>
Alarms reverberated urgently through the city.<br/>
<br/>
The newcomers exchanged astonished glances, baffled at such turmoil within a prestigious immortal city.<br/>
<br/>
With a grave expression, Qing Yan turned toward Ning Zhuo and the rest, instructing firmly: "Proceed to the City Lord's mansion yourselves. I will go investigate the situation and provide aid as best I can!"</div>
