Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
Second Transfer Hall, Second Dao Gate.<br/>
<br/>
“Wahaha!” Meng Chong laughed heartily, standing with his hands on his hips, his face full of joy.<br/>
<br/>
Behind him stood seven or eight puppets, each showing signs of damage.<br/>
<br/>
Despite their battered and broken appearances, they were all extremely excited, cheering loudly.<br/>
<br/>
“We did it! We passed again!”<br/>
<br/>
“A new record, this is a brand-new record.”<br/>
<br/>
“We're still in first place. The closest to us is the Ning family's Ning Zhuo team, but they’ve only just reached the first Dao Gate. Our advantage is too great.” “Truly worthy of being a celestial talent!”<br/>
<br/>
The reformation team from the City Lord's Mansion looked at Meng Chong with deep admiration.<br/>
<br/>
They knew very well: Meng Chong's significant contribution to this achievement was indeed crucial.<br/>
<br/>
Although Meng Chong's temperament was childish and straightforward, often looked down upon by many cultivators, everyone had to admire him, admire his celestial talent.<br/>
<br/>
WildSprint Thunderclap—its applicability is truly broad, its power formidable, capable of what others cannot!<br/>
<br/>
Lava Immortal Palace Main Hall.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit lay on the throne, its gaze penetrating layers of walls and floor tiles, watching the scene of celebration.<br/>
<br/>
It snorted angrily.<br/>
<br/>
The people from the City Lord's Mansion had already entered the second transfer hall, but until now, no one had discovered the peculiarities of the winding stream—if there was only one gate, why set up such a transfer hall?<br/>
<br/>
However, this peculiarity was not noticed by anyone.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit knew the reason very well.<br/>
<br/>
Because in the transfer hall, Yuan Dasheng often appeared, leading to everyone's erroneous assumptions.<br/>
<br/>
“No Mechanical Ape appeared. That's great!”<br/>
<br/>
“I heard that the team formed by the three families was defeated miserably due to the dual interception of the Mechanical Ape and the Slave Soul Puppets because they had too many people.” “I heard they almost won? It was just because Ning Xiaohui wanted to settle personal scores and missed the crucial moment, delaying the battle.” “Damn it.” Meng Chong clenched his fists, his face full of regret.<br/>
<br/>
In his understanding, such transfer halls were often guarded by Mechanical Apes or Slave Soul Puppets.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong eagerly anticipated another fierce battle with Ai Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
But recently, he had encountered the Mechanical Ape too few times, making Meng Chong long for it.<br/>
<br/>
Without Yuan Dasheng guarding, the transfer hall seemed empty.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong stepped forward to push open the second Dao Gate.<br/>
<br/>
The reformation team cultivators hurriedly stopped him.<br/>
<br/>
“Young Master Meng Chong, don't always rush to the front.” “Let us push the door, let us do it.”<br/>
<br/>
“Yes, if there's a mechanism behind this door that injures you, our exploration will surely end here.” “After passing the first transfer hall, we haven't found any preparation rooms. Young Master Meng Chong, please be cautious!” It must be said, Ning Zhuo's various mechanisms and traps left a very deep impression on everyone.<br/>
<br/>
“You worry too much!”<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong brushed aside the crowd and once again walked to the door: “If there really is a trap, I am the one most capable of breaking it.” “You all stay behind and watch me clear this level!”<br/>
<br/>
"Hahaha."<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong laughed heartily, full of vigor.<br/>
<br/>
But as he pushed the door, he immediately let out a sound of surprise: “Hmm?” “What's wrong?” The other cultivators were very nervous.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, Meng Chong laughed even louder, more high-spirited than before: “I found it, I found the subsequent techniques!” “Just by touching this door, we can obtain crucial information, the fourth to sixth layers of the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.” Meng Chong's words brought great joy to everyone.<br/>
<br/>
They had been stuck at the peak of the third layer for quite some time, feeling very uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
Now, they finally obtained the subsequent techniques, allowing their stalled cultivation to get back on track.<br/>
<br/>
“The door won't open; we must cultivate to the peak of the sixth layer to open it.” Meng Chong felt regretful.<br/>
<br/>
But everyone else was jubilant.<br/>
<br/>
Watching their performance, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit anxiously scratched the back of the throne with its claws.<br/>
<br/>
It wanted to tell the celebrating crowd that besides the Dao Gate, there were also the Demonic Gate and the Buddhist Gate.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's authority was limited and could not intervene in this matter.<br/>
<br/>
While it was frustrated and sulking, the culprit behind all this, Ning Zhuo, was summoning the trial disciple's mark.<br/>
<br/>
“Here it comes.”<br/>
<br/>
“I see it!”<br/>
<br/>
In Ning Zhuo's vision, he saw a Life-Hanging Thread descending from the sky, falling above his head.<br/>
<br/>
Divine Ability—Life-Hanging Thread!<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, Ning Zhuo fully activated his divine ability.<br/>
<br/>
The Life-Hanging Thread from the Lava Immortal Palace was severely affected, swaying like a willow in a storm, unable to land on Ning Zhuo's head.<br/>
<br/>
“Hmm?!!” Sensing the anomaly, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit immediately cast its gaze over.<br/>
<br/>
When it saw this scene, it couldn't help but blink repeatedly, feeling like it was dreaming!<br/>
<br/>
Is this real?<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo played with the Life-Hanging Thread from the Lava Immortal Palace, smiling.<br/>
<br/>
He stopped interfering, allowing the Life-Hanging Thread to attach to the back of his head.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, Ning Zhuo once again influenced the Life-Hanging Thread, letting it extract his soul, accelerating his entry into the Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
This strange feeling, again?!<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit couldn't help but be shocked, instinctively standing up, its dragon eyes widening to an unprecedented degree!<br/>
<br/>
Room One.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly assembled his puppet body, leaping down from the pile of mechanical parts.<br/>
<br/>
Now, he was very familiar with the puppet body, his movements light and agile, no longer stiff as before.<br/>
<br/>
Room One was not occupied by Ning Zhuo alone.<br/>
<br/>
“Ning Zhuo Young Master?” The reformation team from the Zhou family recognized Ning Zhuo's identity as a big-headed puppet approached.<br/>
<br/>
“Ning Zhuo.” Leading this small reformation team was one of the Zhou family's geniuses, Zhou Zhu.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had a close relationship with Zhou Zeshen but had little interaction with Zhou Zhu.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, Zhou Zhu was a man of few words, rarely close to anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Zhu knew Ning Zhuo's strength very well, and despite being taciturn, he took the initiative to propose cooperation.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo declined politely: “After all, I am from the Ning family. Sorry, fellow Daoists from the Zhou family.”<br/>
<br/>
A puppet beside Zhou Zhu immediately spoke: “Young Master Ning Zhuo, we all know that you were forced by the main branch of the Ning family to admit that Ning Xiaohui's attack on you was just a mistake.” “But everyone who participated in that action knows it was no mistake.” “It was deliberate, intentional. Fortunately, this is a trial checkpoint, and we all have puppet bodies.” “If it were outside the Immortal Palace, she would be your murderer!”<br/>
<br/>
The Zhou family members were indignant for Ning Zhuo, unaware that Ning Zhuo was the mastermind behind it all.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed deeply, did not respond, but cupped his hands in thanks to everyone, then pushed open the door and entered Room Two.<br/>
<br/>
He hid among the reformation team, and given his current status and reputation, exploring the Immortal Palace alone would not arouse any suspicion.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo skillfully avoided all the mechanisms in Room Two using his spells and quickly stood before the second gate.<br/>
<br/>
The Zhou family cultivators followed Ning Zhuo's footsteps into Room Two.<br/>
<br/>
They witnessed Ning Zhuo's solo breakthrough process.<br/>
<br/>
“Amazing.”<br/>
<br/>
“Didn't expect Young Master Ning Zhuo to be so proficient in spells, it's like second nature to him.”<br/>
<br/>
“No wonder he holds a seminar every few days, sharing his spellcasting insights. Each time, the Ning family's reformation team benefits greatly!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo turned sideways and saw the Life-Hanging Threads above the Zhou family's puppets.<br/>
<br/>
These were all previously set by him.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, every cultivator in the three-family joint team had been visited by Ning Zhuo, each with a Life-Hanging Thread!<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, Ning Zhuo clearly noticed: the Life-Hanging Threads of everyone present from the Zhou family were rapidly thickening.<br/>
<br/>
“Everyone is recognizing me more deeply…”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo waved to the Zhou family members and then pushed open the door to enter Room Three.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had already become famous.<br/>
<br/>
He was the master of the black market, had pulled down his own young clan leader, and was at odds with the main branch of the Ning family.<br/>
<br/>
Everything that happened to him was highly topical.<br/>
<br/>
In the recent joint battle, although the team ultimately failed, Ning Zhuo performed the best, leaving a deep impression.<br/>
<br/>
Even though the post-battle analysis revealed that Ning Zhuo had been fixated on the smoke chariot, showing flaws in his battle command.<br/>
<br/>
But his merits far outweighed his flaws!<br/>
<br/>
Now, even in the large joint team of the three families, Ning Zhuo was a heavyweight, not to be underestimated.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo acted alone, passing several checkpoints in succession, arriving at Room Eight.<br/>
<br/>
Here, he reunited with the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.<br/>
<br/>
Then, with the help of Yuan Dasheng, he advanced rapidly.<br/>
<br/>
To prevent any unexpected occurrences behind him, he also borrowed Cheng Bai, who was lurking in Room Eight.<br/>
<br/>
If any latecomers tried to catch up, Cheng Bai would eliminate them.<br/>
<br/>
Every time, Ning Zhuo had Yuan Dasheng open the door first, meticulously handling these details without making mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
Soon after, he and Yuan Dasheng arrived at the second transfer hall.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong and others had already disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
They were busy advancing their cultivation after obtaining the subsequent techniques.<br/>
<br/>
Their inability to open the gate did not mean Ning Zhuo couldn't.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo pushed open the second Buddhist gate.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing his effortless demeanor, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit gnashed its teeth in anger.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was already familiar with the first checkpoint behind the second Buddhist gate.<br/>
<br/>
Here, he first had to select nine materials, then use limited tools within a limited time to arm Yuan Dasheng as much as possible.<br/>
<br/>
After that, he had to rely on Yuan Dasheng to pass various tests.<br/>
<br/>
During this period, Ning Zhuo could not control Yuan Dasheng and could only rely on its instincts.<br/>
<br/>
“However, now I have a divine ability.” “Life-Hanging Thread, let me see your power!”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo boldly activated his divine ability.<br/>
<br/>
Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit: !!!<br/>
<br/>
It was extremely shocked.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, it finally confirmed that Ning Zhuo had mastered the complete divine ability Life-Hanging Thread!<br/>
<br/>
The Immortal Palace erupted again.<br/>
<br/>
Blinding firelight and soaring magma intertwined.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's roar reached Meng Kui's ears, and the latter frowned slightly, what's going on?<br/>
<br/>
He heard a sense of panic in the roar.<br/>
<br/>
Life-Hanging Thread is effective!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo didn't even use the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, just using the Life-Hanging Thread to command Ai Dasheng to cheat, easily passing each test.<br/>
<br/>
Although Yuan Dasheng had intelligence, it retained its habits from life, preferring close combat over spellcasting.<br/>
<br/>
This flaw was nullified with Ning Zhuo's cooperation.<br/>
<br/>
That day, Ning Zhuo passed three checkpoints in a row, reaching the third transfer hall.<br/>
<br/>
He touched the Buddhist gate, Dao Gate, and Demonic gate in turn.<br/>
<br/>
The seventh, eighth, and ninth layers of the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique, Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique, and Demonic Blood Vein Technique all fell into Ning Zhuo's hands.<br/>
<br/>
Before leaving, Ning Zhuo thoughtfully raised the stone tablets of the Buddhist and Demonic gates.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving only one Dao Gate.<br/>
<br/>
