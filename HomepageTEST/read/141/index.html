<div id="chapterContent">Chapter 141: Ning Xiaohui vs.

Meng Chong

Lava Immortal Palace.

Room One.

Various mechanical components were piled up like a small mountain.

The puppet Ning Zhuo jumped down from the mountain.

"You're a bit slow," the puppet Ning Xiaohui said, arms crossed, staring at Ning Zhuo with a hint of arrogance.

Ning Zhou shrugged, "I've been obsessed with improving the mechanical Tree Martial Ape lately, not in the best state. Ning Xiaohui, you insisted on me joining you to break through the barriers, but with just the two of us, are you confident?"

Ning Xiaohui snorted coldly, "The opportunities in the Lava Immortal Palace are right in front of us. Fire Persimmon Immortal City is contending from all sides, and our Ning family is currently last. I called you here simply because you are a member of the Ning family."

"You don't need to do anything. This time, just follow behind me!" After saying this, Ning Xiaohui turned and walked away.

Ning Zhou hesitated slightly, thinking, "Ning Xiaohui's demeanor is completely different from before. Such a big tone, she must have had a significant breakthrough or has a major reliance." Ning Zhou felt a bit curious.

Though he showed reluctance when Ning Xiaohui called him to enter the palace together, he was actually quite pleased.

Joining the modification team was the right choice! This action had been giving him positive feedback all along.

Ning Zhuo was worried about not having a reason to enter the Lava Immortal Palace, and now, Ning Xiaohui had come to him voluntarily.

Regarding Ning Xiaohui's arrangement, Ning Zhuo was also happy to follow her and take it easy.

The first door.

Ning Xiaohui and Ning Zhuo stepped forward to receive their rewards.

"You choose the spirit stones, I have a use for them," Ning Xiaohui instructed.

"Understood!" Ning Zhuo complied readily.

Currently, only the two of them in the Ning family were at the peak of the third layer of Qi Refining Stage, and Ning Zhuo's true cultivation had not been exposed.

Therefore, among the clan, Ning Xiaohui could only call him to participate.

After receiving the spirit stones, Ning Zhuo directly handed them to Ning Xiaohui.

This action made Ning Xiaohui feel satisfied.

She nodded and accepted them, "At least you understand."

Ning Zhuo chuckled softly, "As long as you can lead me deeper, I'm willing to cooperate with you."

"Watch closely," Ning Xiaohui said, pushing open the door.

But she only pushed it open a crack.

That was enough.

Then, she silently activated her innate talent.

Ice Jade Hand!

The puppet Ning Xiaohui's hands emitted a white light, releasing intense freezing qi.

The freezing qi quickly spread, covering the walls and ceiling of Room Two through the door crack, freezing everything except the door.

Ning Xiaohui pushed the door open and walked in gracefully.

Ning Zhou followed closely, praising continuously, "Amazing, truly amazing! Ning Xiaohui, you are indeed remarkable. What kind of technique is this?" Ning Zhuo asked deliberately.

"Hmph, with your knowledge, you only know about techniques," Ning Xiaohui snorted coldly.

She enjoyed hearing flattery and praise, but outwardly remained indifferent, as if these feats were trivial to her.

"This is my innate talentâ€”Ice Jade Hand!" Ning Xiaohui declared calmly, slightly raising her head.

"Ice Jade Hand?!" Ning Zhuo exclaimed, widening his eyes and staring at Ning Xiaohui.

"Your innate talent can achieve this level?" Ning Zhuo acted extremely surprised.

This made Ning Xiaohui feel very pleased.

Ning Zhuo continued, "Since you can do this, why didn't you use it before?"

Ning Xiaohui snorted coldly, "On one hand, I hadn't fully mastered it and couldn't use it freely; on the other hand, are you a pig-brain? There were outsiders present, why would I expose this trump card?"

Ning Zhuo nodded repeatedly, "Understood, it has to be you, Xiaohui. You have always been so outstanding since childhood!"

"No wonder you said before that I just need to follow you. You are truly amazing."

"With you in our Ning family, we will surely rank at the top, leaving the other three forces behind!"

Ning Xiaohui enjoyed Ning Zhuo's praise greatly.

She specifically brought Ning Zhuo along this time to subdue this talented branch member, letting the entire modification team know who the leader was!

So far, the plan was going very smoothly.

"You are a member of the Ning family, you should know this."

"In the future, as long as you follow me, you will continuously achieve victories!"

"By the way, you also have innate talent."

"But to develop it, you need to first determine what kind it is."

"I look forward to your future performance!"

"Understood! I will definitely work hard," Ning Zhuo said, following Ning Xiaohui's words, adopting a humble posture.

Ning Xiaohui continued to break through the barriers.

She kept using her innate talent, emitting rolling freezing qi, gradually freezing Room Two.

From the front section to the middle, and then extending from the middle to the rear section.

Ning Xiaohui was exhausted, her soul power rapidly depleting.

There was no way around it; this was just a puppet body, not her original flesh.

The transmission of life force between them caused significant loss.

In the end, Ning Xiaohui does not have any related divine abilities in embryonic form.

Ning Xiaohui was as tired as a dog, while Ning Zhuo followed behind in a relaxed manner.

However, he certainly did not show any sign of ease.

He appeared very nervous, speaking continuously, sometimes praising Ning Xiahui, sometimes expressing concerns about the future, and sometimes advising Ning Xiahui to rest for a while.

Ning Xiaohui vetoed the proposal to rest.

Because the frost emitted by her innate talent could not freeze for long and would soon thaw.

Therefore, Ning Xiaohui could only do her best.

It was the wisest choice to break through to the second gate as soon as possible.

"Xiao Hui, you are amazing!"

"Just a few more steps, and we will reach the second gate, completely passing this checkpoint."

"Why is there still such a long distance?" Ning Xiaohui felt extremely difficult, but she had to maintain a strong front on the surface, gritting her teeth and exerting all her strength.

Just as she and Ning Zhuo were about to succeed, the door behind them suddenly opened.

In the next moment, the puppet Meng Chong walked in.

He saw Ning Zhuo and Ning Xiaohui, and couldn't help but be stunned.

"It's Meng Chong!" Ning Zhuo shouted, his voice slightly trembling, revealing a strong sense of fear.

"Meng Chong." Ning Xiaohui's gaze sharpened.

In her perception, Meng Chong was her only enemy and the biggest competitor.

But Meng Chong glanced at the two from the Ning family and then withdrew his gaze.

Crack.

Electricity flickered as Meng Chong moved as fast as lightning, bouncing off the walls and ceiling.

"You..." He stood in front of the first gate and spoke.

"Too slow." After saying this, Meng Chong dispersed the electricity and had already landed in front of the second gate.

Ning Xiaohui: !!!

Meng Chong's dominance deeply shook her.

She took a deep breath, "Meng Chong, mutual benefit. You've seen my strength, let's cooperate and explore the Immortal Palace together." Ning Xiaohui took the initiative to extend an invitation.

However, Meng Chong extended his hand towards her and said, "Just you?" Xianzi - Wild Sprint Thunderclap.

With the blessing of electricity, the speed of the rushing Qi flow became extremely fast.

Originally just a supportive spell, it unexpectedly turned into an attacking technique.

Too fast!

Ning Xiahui couldn't react in time and was swept away by the Qi flow.

She hit the wall on the side and triggered a trap, being ruthlessly smashed by the mechanical hammer.

Ning Zhuo ran to rescue Ning Xiaohui, but halfway stepped on a trap, falling into darkness once again, only able to struggle until her soul power was exhausted in the trap.

"Two small fries." Meng Chong sneered, turned around to claim his reward, and entered the third level with a serious expression.

With high fighting spirit, he entered room three and shouted loudly, "I, Meng Chong, am back!" "That mechanical ape, today I will seek revenge and settle the score!" "Huh?"

"Where are the people?!" Meng Chong scanned the room once, then couldn't help but scan it again, still not finding his "long-awaited and unforgettable" mechanical ape.

"What's going on?"

"Where is the mechanical monkey?!" Meng Chong felt extremely despondent, as if he had punched cotton, feeling a strong sense of loss.

He had diligently practiced and made great progress in strength, but the target he had surpassed in his mind was gone!

"If I continue to advance through the levels, will I encounter it again?" Meng Chong harbored hope once more.

Without Yuan Dasheng, although there were many martial puppet in room three, they were no match for Meng Chong at all.

After some time, Meng Chong defeated all the martial puppets, pushed open the door, and officially entered the preparation room.

"This checkpoint seems a bit special?" "What is that?"

At a glance, he saw the ranking stone pillar.</div>
