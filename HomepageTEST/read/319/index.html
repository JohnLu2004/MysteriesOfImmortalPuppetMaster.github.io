<div id="chapterContent">Chapter 319: Karmic Fire

The heavenly craftsman ignites the karmic fire of retribution, and the consequences manifest immediately, demanding immediate accountability!

"Give me another opportunity!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit roared in fury, once again overstepping its bounds, forcibly causing trouble.

The cultivators who barged in did not have the qualifications for the palace trial, and their path through the Secret Pavilion was not counted among the thirty-six quotas.

Previously, the major opportunity had not been fully utilized by Ning Zhuo and Meng Chong, with Zhu Xuanji, Song Fuli, and Zheng Danlian being the major consumers.

Even so, the three had not exhausted the thirty-six quotas.

But now, with the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit and Meng Kui cooperating from inside and outside, they took advantage of the Lava Immortal Palace's weakened restrictions to prematurely initiate the opportunity.

After this round of opportunity, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's spirituality was greatly diminished, its body semi-transparent, flickering in and out of sight.

It fell into an extremely weak state, curled up to the size of a fingertip, enduring the relentless whipping, breathing with difficulty.

Meng Kui was not much better off.

At this stage, he was still a distance away from directly intervening in the business.

Forcing his hand now, even with the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit as an internal ally, meant directly confronting the Lava Immortal Palace and its restrictions.

His aura greatly diminished, his hair instantly turned snow-white, and seven precious blood droplets slowly flowed out.

In an instant, he aged more than ten years.

The relative position of the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities was overturned once again!

Originally, Zhu Xuanji and others had gradually caught up with the shadow demon cultivators, but this effort was now in vain.

Ning Zhuo and Meng Chong were in the same pavilion and were not affected by this.

But in the next moment, Ning Zhuo suddenly self-ignited.

Scarlet flames burned him, with the flame tips turning yellow-brown, exuding a strong and intense aura of malice.

"What is this?!" Ning Zhuo was horrified.

Without the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, Ning Zhuo could not suppress the effects of the fate energy, nor could he defend against the attack on this technique.

He was hit!

As the flames burned, he felt his cultivation rapidly declining.

His five senses, strength, and qi plummeted as if falling off a cliff.

"How did I get hit?" Ning Zhuo felt a chill throughout his body.

Transferring the wooden blocks required expending his spirit and qi. By the end, his vision darkened, seeing double, and he could hardly continue.

Meng Chong attacked again.

The heavily armored blood ape took a step forward, using its massive body as a defense line.

Previously, this defense line was very solid, always causing Meng Chong to return empty-handed. But this time, the situation was very different.

The heavily armored blood ape had no spirituality residing within, relying entirely on Ning Zhuo's control.

Ning Zhuo's poor condition caused the heavily armored blood ape's combat power to plummet.

Fortunately, Ning Xie had perfect spirituality and the ability to autonomously protect its master. The Ice Snow Weather Sphere shot out ice spikes, sealing off the firepower, forcing Meng Chong back once again.

Meng Chong panted heavily.

Fighting until now, he fully acknowledged Ning Zhuo's strength, treating him as a true opponent!

His body was covered in wounds, and his condition had also deteriorated significantly.

But his fighting spirit did not diminish; instead, it grew more vigorous as the situation became more difficult!

Just as he was about to charge again...

Bang.

The door was suddenly pushed open.

A frantic old woman burst in: "Xiaohui, where have you taken my Xiaohui?!" she shouted, her eyes reflecting the scarlet glow of karmic fire.

Clearly, she and Meng Chong were closer to the door, but she pointed her finger directly at Ning Zhuo.

"It's you, you hid my Xiaohui, didn't you?! Return my granddaughter to me!!"

Ning Xiaohui's grandmother screamed madly, charging at Ning Zhuo, launching a reckless attack.

Meng Chong was stunned.

Immediately, the door was pushed open again.

The former young clan leader of the Ning family, Ning Xiaoren, entered.

His pupils also reflected the scarlet firelight, his face twisted with hatred: "Ning Zhuo, you little rabbit! It's all thanks to you that I've fallen to this state. Now, you still want to break out of here and sit on the palace master's seat? Hehehe, as long as I'm here, it's impossible!" Ning Xiaoren also charged at Ning Zhuo.

Meng Chong was bewildered.

He hesitated, wondering whether to join the attack, when the door was pushed open once more.

Zhou Zhu and Zhou Zeshen entered hand in hand.

"I've never seen that big door before; it might be the last door to successfully pass through!" "But Ning Zhuo is occupying it..."

"Attack!"

Meng Chong: ...

These frequent intrusions were clearly not coincidences.

So many cultivators barged in, all ignoring Meng Chong, seeing Ning Zhuo as the enemy.

Meng Chong stared at the flames engulfing Ning Zhuo, puzzled as to who had made the move.

At this moment, Meng Kui's voice reached his ear: "Child, seize the opportunity, open the door, and enter the main hall!"

"It was Grandpa." Meng Chong suddenly understood.

Ning Zhuo's condition was extremely poor, almost unable to see.

Fortunately, he had advanced to the Foundation Establishment stage and mastered divine sense, which he could use to observe enemies.

However, the range of his divine sense was also rapidly shrinking.

The door was continuously pushed open.

All the cultivators who barged in had karmic entanglements with Ning Zhuo.

Figures like Ning Xiangguo, Zheng Hua, and even his uncle Ning Ze appeared. He had also jumped into the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities.

"Ning Zhuo, how did you avenge your cousin? To ascend to the position of branch family Clan Leader, you even used your own blood kin's enmity as a bargaining chip!" "Now, this is your retribution!!"

Ning Zhuo's pupils were filled with firelight, his reason barely remaining, clouded by fate energy.

Sun Lingtong pushed the door open and entered.

"Little Zhuo, I finally found you!" Sun Lingtong was overjoyed, his eyes also reflecting the firelight.

At this moment, Ning Zhuo was in grave danger, his divine sense reduced to within eight feet of his body. Often, he could only let the mechanical constructs act on their own.

Sun Lingtong shook his wrist, and the storage ring shot out a strange light, landing at the edge of the battlefield, revealing the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.

The Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng was in a terrible state. Although Sun Lingtong had patched it up and made emergency repairs, his methods were crude and could not compare to Ning Zhuo's.

The Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng charged straight at the heavily armored blood ape, embracing it warmly.

The two made close contact, and Yuan Dasheng's spirituality automatically flew out, entering the heavily armored blood ape.

"Master, I have arrived!" The heavily armored blood ape Dasheng roared, sweeping away its previous stiffness, becoming extraordinarily agile.

The internal mechanical component, the heart furnace fire essence, was as large as a ball, operating at full capacity.

A large amount of fire persimmons was consumed rapidly, converted into surging qi.

The surface of the heart furnace was covered with various cylindrical protrusions, expanding and contracting wildly, providing strong power in all directions!

In the critical moment, the heavily armored blood ape Dasheng stood up bravely, heroically protecting its master.

This mechanical shell, made with a large amount of Golden Core stage materials, was solid and sturdy, allowing Yuan Dasheng to display near-Golden Core combat power.

Although Ning Xiaohui's grandmother and others were numerous, they were ultimately only at the Foundation Establishment stage, unable to reach the Golden Core level. Protected by the heavily armored blood ape Dasheng, Ning Zhuo broke through a path.

Sun Lingtong, wielding dual daggers and dressed as a shadow demon cultivator, attacked Ning Xiaohui's grandmother and others, covering Ning Zhuo's retreat.

Just as he was about to breathe a sigh of relief, the small door of the Secret Pavilion was pushed open again.

Golden light scattered out.

Zhu Xuanji, maintaining three divine abilities, made a grand entrance!</div>
