<div id="chapterContent">Chapter 119: Hidden Investigator and Pacifier, Zhu Xuanji

A little over a month ago.

South Dou Kingdom.

Middle section of the E’Long River.

Xuanlin City.

The streets were crowded with people.

Guards escorted a mechanical prison cart slowly through the streets.

Inside the cart was a Golden Core cultivator, heavily chained, with disheveled hair and closed eyes.

The city residents, upon seeing this person, were enraged, cursing loudly while throwing rotten eggs, vegetable scraps, spoiled food, and even stones.

“Smash him, smash this corrupt official to death!”

“If he hadn't embezzled the disaster relief funds, my grandfather wouldn't have starved to death.”

“He’s worse than demonic cultivators, feeding off the people's hard-earned money! This is exactly the fate he deserves!”

The Golden Core prisoner kept his head down, eyes closed, with a lifeless expression.

Watching the chaotic scene from afar, Zhu Xuanji sighed deeply and said to the group beside him, “It’s about time for me to depart.” The current city lord of Xuanlin City, standing nearby, bowed in respect. “We are deeply grateful for your intervention, Lord Zhu. Without you, this vile individual would have continued to deceive us.”

Zhu Xuanji smiled faintly, giving the city lord a meaningful look. “Lord Su, take good care of yourself.” With that, he mounted his horse and left directly.

City Lord Su watched Zhu Xuanji's retreating figure, a constant smile on his face, though his eyes held a glint of coldness.

“Ah, it’s Lord Zhu!”

“Lord Zhu is here.”

“Lord Zhu, thank you for uncovering the truth! If it weren’t for you…”

“Lord Zhu, please don’t leave! Stay and be our official!”

It started with one person kneeling by the street, soon followed by a second and a third.

The city residents knelt down, crying and thanking him, pleading for him to stay.

As Zhu Xuanji rode through the same street as the Golden Core prisoner, the response he received was entirely different.

Riding on his horse, Zhu Xuanji smiled and waved continuously.

With the people’s gratitude and prayers, he made his way to the city gate, where he finally looked back at the kneeling crowd and the city lord standing at the street's end.

“The Su family…”

Zhu Xuanji sighed, a shadow of gloom clouding his eyes.

He knew the real mastermind was the city lord from the Su family, but the latter had ruthlessly eliminated all evidence by killing those who knew too much, leaving no proof for Zhu Xuanji to seize.

The only person Zhu Xuanji managed to capture was a Golden Core cultivator under the city lord’s command.

Zhu Xuanji urged his horse to speed up and quickly caught up with the prisoner escort team ahead.

The team moved steadily along a country path.

Suddenly, the leading cultivator shouted angrily, "Who dares to intercept the imperial escort team? Do you have a death wish?!"

The person blocking the path quickly begged for mercy, his voice old and trembling, "Honorable officials, I am not a bandit. I have come specifically to thank Lord Zhu."

Zhu Xuanji scanned the area with his divine sense and immediately ordered, "Calm down, I recognize this old man. He is not an enemy." He gently kicked his horse’s sides and moved to the front of the team.

Seeing a familiar face, he smiled softly, "Old man, we meet again."

The old man bowed deeply, tears streaming down his face, "I am ashamed, for I was blind and could not see a true hero. When you passed by my tea house, I even insulted you. I cannot find peace without coming to apologize and thank you."

Zhu Xuanji dismounted and approached the old man, reaching out to help him up. "Old man, has your family's land been returned to you?"

The old man began to cry again, choking up, "Yes, it has. Not just our land, but all the good fields in our village have been returned."

"That’s good," Zhu Xuanji nodded. 

The old man took out a bag of spirit stones, "Lord Zhu, this is a token of our village’s gratitude..."

Zhu Xuanji raised his hand, "I will not accept it."

"This bag of spirit rice is also from our village..."

Zhu Xuanji laughed lightly, "Old man, I don’t need these things."

The old man became anxious, "This is just a small token of our village's appreciation. We just want to express our endless gratitude, Lord Zhu..."

Zhu Xuanji reached out, "Old man, do you remember our first meeting? I passed by your tea house at the village entrance. You saw I was weary and invited me to sit."

"You offered me a bowl of sweet water even though I told you I had no money to pay for tea," Zhu Xuanji continued.

The old man nodded, wiping his tears, "How could I forget?"

"You told me about the corruption and neglect by the officials in Xuanlin City. When I asked for details, you misunderstood and thought I was defending the corrupt officials, so you angrily spilled my sweet water."

"Ha ha ha," Zhu Xuanji laughed heartily, "It’s good you remember!" He clasped his hands in a salute, "If I am fortunate, may I trouble you to offer me another bowl of sweet water?"

The old man was stunned.

Seeing Zhu Xuanji’s serious and sincere expression, his vision blurred again as tears flowed.

He quickly nodded, "Please, please! I am honored beyond measure to offer Lord Zhu tea again."

Zhu Xuanji shook his head, "Not tea, I just want a bowl of sweet water."

The old man took out his storage pouch and prepared a bowl of sweet water right there.

Holding the crude pottery bowl, Zhu Xuanji drank heartily, "Such sweet water, so good!"

The guards witnessing this scene remained silent.

Bidding farewell to the old man, Zhu Xuanji continued his journey.

No one disturbed the prisoner, and the journey was peaceful.

Upon entering the capital, he had not yet rested when he was immediately summoned by the king.

Zhu Xuanji knelt on one knee, clasped his fists, and saluted, saying loudly, "Your Majesty, I have returned from Xuanlin City, having uncovered the details of the corruption. Fortunately, I did not fail in my mission..."

Smack!

The king of Nandou slapped the table and reprimanded, "Zhu Xuanji! You entered the capital and handed over the prisoner but did not think to report to me. Must I summon you myself?" 

"'Fortunately, I did not fail'? Ha! Before you left, what instructions did I give you?" 

"Yet you went to Xuanlin City and did as you pleased, ignoring my orders. And you say you did not fail? Did you think I summoned you to praise you?"

"Your Majesty, I dare not," Zhu Xuanji replied with a bitter smile.

The king of Nandou sighed deeply, "Zhu Xuanji... you are a member of the royal family. Do you not know the influence the Su family holds in our country? By arresting the subordinate of the Jindan, you have disgraced the Su family. Several senior ministers from the Su family have already submitted their resignations, stating that the Su family's reputation must not be tarnished."

"I tasked you with investigating the case, not causing a disturbance in the court!"

Zhu Xuanji looked up, his face serious, "Your Majesty, I respectfully disagree. In my opinion, the major clans within Nandou have already become deeply entrenched and difficult to remove. The Su family controls several immortal cities and has numerous members in high positions within the court, excluding newcomers and monopolizing governance."

"If this continues, they will become a significant threat to our country."

"As members of the royal family, we should support new clans and individuals, rejuvenate the court with fresh perspectives, care for the common people, and recruit talent from the populace to balance the influence of the old great clans."

The king of Nandou snorted coldly, "Nonsense! In the past, when Taishang Xing expanded the territory, how much did the Su family sacrifice? Such founding merits cannot be treated lightly. If this were known, how would foreign talents view our country?"

"They gave you a title, 'Zhu Xuanji, the Investigator and Protector of the People,' and you really took pride in it, didn't you?"

"Your Majesty, I dare not," Zhu Xuanji lowered his head.

The king of Nandou sighed lightly, "Enough. Perhaps I have always expected too much from you. Your handling of this case was indeed better than before. I have read your secret report."

"The Su family’s city lord is implicated, and everyone in the court is aware."

"But let this matter end here. The Jindan cultivator will be beheaded in the marketplace as a conclusion."

Zhu Xuanji volunteered, "I am willing to serve as the executioner!"

The king of Nandou shook his head, "The court is unstable. As a member of the royal family, you must consider things from my perspective as well."

"With your status, if you serve as the executioner, people will speculate whether it is the will of the royal family or mine. How could the court and its officials not harbor suspicions?"

"You should leave the capital," he continued. "Coincidentally..."

The king of Nandou pulled out a memorial from the corner of his desk and tossed it to the ground in front of Zhu Xuanji, "Get up and take a look."

Zhu Xuanji replied, "Yes, Your Majesty." He slowly stood up and reached out to pick up the document.

An invisible force lifted the memorial from the ground and placed it into his hand.

Zhu Xuanji unfolded the memorial and quickly read through it, his face showing a look of surprise, "Lava Immortal Palace?"

The king of Nandou said, "Indeed. This is the former residence of the Three Lords of the Sects, built with great affection when they were in love with the Taishang Emperor. Originally, it was buried within the Lava Mountain to suppress volcanic eruptions and transform the land from a cursed place to a blessed one. It was supposed to continue suppressing the underground fire for another hundred years, but it has now emerged. There must be something unusual about this."

"Your mission is to investigate the reason for the emergence of the Lava Immortal Palace. The palace contains the mechanisms and legacies of the Three Lords of the Sects. You meet the criteria for this mission. Whether you can obtain the legacy depends on your fortune and skills. Your trip to Xuanlin City was both a success and a failure. I have my reasons not to reward or punish you. Go to the Lava Immortal Palace and see if you can obtain the legacy."

"Your Majesty, I accept the task!" Zhu Xuanji expressed his gratitude, "My expertise in mechanism arts is thanks to the training by the royal family. I will give my all to uncover the truth on this journey."

The king of Nandou nodded, "I have three points to remind you of. First, the relationship between the Three Lords of the Sects and the Taishang Emperor of our royal family was profound. It can be said that our nation's foundation greatly depended on the Three Lords. Their contributions and influence are comparable to our national teacher. In his later years, the Three Lords set up the Lava Immortal Palace within the Lava Mountain for deep, inscrutable purposes. You must not act recklessly. Go with the flow and do not disturb the painstaking efforts of the Three Lords."

"Second, the Taishang Emperor owed his life to the Three Lords' divine skill, the 'Lifestring of Fate.' After the Taishang Emperor, no one in our Zhu family has inherited this skill. It has become a lost art. One of your primary objectives is to reclaim this divine skill. If possible, strive to obtain it. If you discover anyone else mastering this skill, eliminate them at all costs to prevent future threats."
