On the third and fourth days, members of the branch families actively sought out Ning Zhuo, offering their services.

Ning Zhuo accepted them all without hesitation.

What pleased him even more were the former stewards.

These elite Foundation Establishment cultivators privately approached Ning Zhuo, recommending their descendants to him.

This behavior held significant meaning in the righteous path.

It indicated that these Foundation Establishment cultivators truly pledged their loyalty to Ning Zhuo, recognizing his future and willing to entrust their descendants to him, while also securing a future for their offspring.

Ning Zhuo had different requirements for these people.

He noticed that the descendants of these former stewards were generally young and had low cultivation levels.

Ning Zhuo coldly stated, "If you want me to accept them, they must disperse their cultivation and switch to the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique!" Many hesitated, worried about future cultivation methods, but a small portion of the former stewards immediately agreed.

In a small courtyard, Ning Houjun and Ning Youfu, two former elders, were playing chess.

Ning Youfu held a piece, lost in thought for a long time.

Ning Houjun couldn't help but urge, "Hurry up and make your move." Ning Youfu placed his piece on the board and sighed, "Too fast, too fast." Ning Houjun laughed heartily, "Are you talking about Ning Zhuo? This junior's rise is indeed faster than we imagined." Ning Youfu sighed again, correcting, "Much faster!"

"Ning Xiaohui's framing was initially a crisis, but Ning Zhuo resolved it perfectly, turning it into a huge opportunity for himself!" "Do you think this kid has his own means, or is someone guiding him?" Ning Houjun glared, "What do you mean? Praising yourself in front of me?" Ning Youfu laughed heartily, "Old friend, you're still hiding things from me. You're playing chess quite 'slowly' too."

In the clan leader's study, Ning Xiaohui's grandmother dragged Ning Xiaohui to meet the clan leader. "Kneel!" Ning Xiaohui's grandmother's voice was stern, "Look at the trouble you've caused!" Ning Xiaohui gritted her teeth and knelt before the clan leader, saying, "Clan Leader, I know my mistake! This time, I was too jealous of Ning Zhuo. When I heard the ancestors needed Night Wind Soft Iron, I reported Ning Zhuo without thinking. It was my lack of composure." "This instead gave him a great opportunity to rise!"

At this point, Ning Xiaohui bit her lip in anger.

She was furious.

She had thought she could frame Ning Zhuo, causing him significant loss and forcing him to swallow his pride.

Unexpectedly, she ended up being the clown.

What she thought was a frame-up turned into an opportunity for Ning Zhuo, making him famous among the Golden Core cultivators and rapidly expanding his personal influence.

Thinking about how she had facilitated all this, Ning Xiaohui felt like committing suicide!

Ning Xiaohui's grandmother watched the clan leader's expression, "Clan Leader, although Xiaohui is my granddaughter, her actions this time caused significant loss to the main family! How to punish her is entirely up to you!" The clan leader stared at the grandmother and granddaughter, knowing that their voluntary admission of guilt was the least damaging route.

He snorted coldly, "Of course, she must be severely punished. However, Ning Xiaohui, you are currently involved in the ancestors' artifact refining, and your role is not insignificant." "I will punish you by making you atone for your crimes through meritorious deeds!"

Ning Xiaohui's grandmother was overjoyed, "Clan Leader is wise, thank you, Clan Leader!" After the grandmother and granddaughter left, the clan leader, in a fit of rage, grabbed the inkstone and threw it, smashing several items on the desk.

After venting his anger, he calmed down, his face full of frustration. "Ning Zhuo's influence has grown!" In just a few days, the situation had changed drastically.

Ning Zhuo had fully utilized a casual remark from the Ning family ancestor, expanding his influence by at least seven times! His status within the family had risen several levels.

"Ning Zhuo wants some Foundation Establishment cultivators' descendants to switch to the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique. He intends to bypass the family's cultivation method restrictions and create a new path for advancement." "His ambition is evident!" "It's the Lava Immortal Palace that gave him this opportunity. Without the palace, no matter how outstanding he is, what could he achieve? It's all about timing and fate!" "Isn't he supposed to be greedy and stingy? How did he handle this so well? Who is guiding him behind the scenes?" Thinking of this, the clan leader felt even more disheartened.

"In fact, who is guiding Ning Zhuo doesn't matter at all." "What matters is the attitude of the Golden Core ancestors!" The source of power, the largest part, is violence.

The Golden Core cultivator Ning Jiufan is the highest combat power in the entire clan, so he naturally holds the highest authority.

Ning Jiufan is encouraging Ning Zhuo! This is Ning Jiufan's attitude, and it is the reason why the entire Ning family main branch is in a state of panic.

The clan leader smiled bitterly to himself, "Ning Jiufan has a bond of gratitude and affection with the main branch, but over the years, we've troubled him too many times, exhausting much of that bond." "Over a decade ago, during the main and branch family dispute, the ancestor was already dissatisfied with the harsh punishment of the main branch." "He hopes for the entire Ning family to grow stronger, not just the main branch!" Realizing this, the clan leader knew he couldn't stop Ning Zhuo.

He had initially planned to use Ning Zhuo's collection of family members' flesh and blood as leverage.

Now, with Ning Zhuo gaining the ancestor's approval, exposing him would be like slapping the ancestor in the face.

Doing so would make him a fool!

The clan leader could only secretly plant his people within Ning Zhuo's forces.

Ning Zhuo quietly expanded his influence.

Now, the number of family members offering their flesh and blood to him had tripled.

This meant that Ning Zhuo's cultivation speed in the Demonic Blood Vein Technique also tripled! Ning Zhuo publicly claimed that he needed the same-source flesh and blood for research to refine puppet bodies.

No one doubted him.

All suspicions were buried deep in their hearts during his moment of glory.

With the Golden Core ancestor's approval, who dared to question him?

Ning Houjun and Ning Youfu expressed their admiration, believing that Ning Zhuo's cultivation was too low, only at the third layer of Qi Refining, and that he needed to master some life-saving techniques.

Ning Youfu even gave Ning Zhuo a talisman, "This is a Substitute Talisman. Study it well and return it to me once you've mastered it." The Substitute Talisman could take damage in place of the cultivator at a critical moment.

Used well, it could save a life.

Life-saving resources and treasures have always been the most valuable.

Ning Youfu valued Ning Zhuo's prospects and didn't hesitate to give him a life-saving item for research, hoping to foster goodwill.

Ning Zhuo's rise was beyond imagination.

Seeing the situation, the former elder had to speed up his investment.

Otherwise, when Ning Zhuo truly spread his wings, the cost of investing and currying favor would be much higher, and he might not even have the opportunity.

Ning Zhuo didn't expect such an unexpected gain.

He immediately decided that such a good item must be kept. "Researching the Substitute Talisman is too difficult." "Studying it for ten or eight years wouldn't be excessive, right?"

Losing the Night Wind Soft Iron didn't hinder Ning Zhuo from continuing to refine Golden Core-level mechanical apes.

His influence surged, and by collaborating with the Zhou and Zheng families, he could make a significant impact.

By outsourcing the hard and tedious work, Ning Zhuo leveraged the power of the three major righteous families in Fire Persimmon Immortal City to refine treasures on a large scale.

"This Ning Zhuo junior is indeed interesting," Zhou Nongying remarked. "Even that cunning Fei Si acknowledges him," Zheng Danlian laughed.

Ning Jiufan merely smiled without speaking.

Ning Zhuo's actions caused a huge stir in the Ning family, with the ripples affecting the Zhou and Zheng families.

Recently, Ning Zhuo had become the most prominent figure in the righteous path.

The source of all this was just a single remark from Ning Jiufan.

Ning Zhuo's matters were merely interesting topics for the Golden Core ancestors, something to discuss casually over meals.

"The Night Wind Soft Iron has been thoroughly inspected and preliminarily processed. Everyone, prepare for refining!" Zheng Shuangjun announced.

The Golden Core ancestors chose an auspicious time and sat at the array's core positions.

The light of the Heavenly Craft Lamp suddenly intensified! The boundless earth fire, purified by the array, removed all fire fiends, toxins, and impurities, channeling into the Heavenly Craft Lamp.

The lamp flame grew seven times larger, from the size of a fingertip to that of a cup.

The divine senses of the Golden Core cultivators delved into the flame, being consumed by its intense heat.

The seemingly small flame concealed a vast world, with a sea of fire within!

Despite the blazing red flames, the mechanical weapon, like an ancient giant serpent, remained defiant.

The two Golden Core cultivators of the Zheng family took turns, using artifact refining techniques.

A volcano rose from the sea of fire, towering and majestic, suppressing the mechanical weapon within its body.

The flames outside the mountain surged in, turning into red light as they entered the mountain, gradually softening the mechanical weapon.

One by one, Golden Core-level materials were added to the volcano, turning into streams of five-colored smoke, merging into the mechanical weapon.

The final material was the Night Wind Soft Iron! The molten iron poured in, mixed with the smoke, quickly solidifying and completely filling the gaps in the mechanical weapon.

However, the black serpent roared in defiance, twisting its body and attempting to bite its own vital spot. "Wretched creature! Will you not submit and surrender?" Zheng Shuangjun shouted, fully exerting his technique.

The flames formed chains, binding the black serpent tightly.

The Zheng family patriarch stepped into the external array, fully utilizing his innate talent—Thousand Refinements!

In the world of the lamp flame, the red flames condensed into countless hammers, swarming and enveloping the black serpent, continuously striking.

With each strike, the serpent's resistance weakened slightly, and the fire hammers shattered.

After thousands of strikes, the black serpent collapsed, though its head still bore a fierce and defiant expression.

Zheng Shuangjun, drenched in sweat, ceased his control and quickly sat down, swallowing pills to replenish his energy.

Zheng Danlian took over, urging the flames to continue refining the mechanical weapon.

The black serpent emitted a dense shadow, swaying like willow branches, easily resisting the raging flames.

Seeing this, Zhu Xuanji's eyes flashed with golden light, "This seems to be an old artifact from the Night Rain Dynasty! You have calculated well, making me, a member of the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family and the Divine Constable Division, help you refine a forbidden item!" Zhou Nongying smiled, "Master Zhu, your words are inappropriate. As far as I know, the Southern Bean Kingdom has not banned Night Rain artifacts." Zhu Xuanji's expression turned serious, and he snorted coldly, "The Night Rain Demon Weapon, though incredibly powerful, is deeply demonic and often devours its master. Mishandling it could lead to our downfall. This weapon cannot be used!"</div>
