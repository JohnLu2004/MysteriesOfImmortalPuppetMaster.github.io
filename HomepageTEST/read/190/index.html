<div id="chapterContent">Chapter 190: Ning Zhuo Presents the Treasure

A magical artifact in the form of inner armor was thrown into the furnace by Sun Lingtong.

Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra!

The magical artifact gradually melted away, turning into nothingness, but it left behind a rich spiritual essence.

The spiritual essence quickly infused into the Ice Snow Weather Sphere, bringing its spiritual essence to a full ten percent.

Ten percent spiritual essence, self-sufficient!

From now on, even if the spiritual essence of the Ice Snow Weather Sphere is damaged, it can recover on its own.

The spiritual essence of the Ice Snow Weather Sphere originated from the ghost cultivator Ning Xie.

When Ning Zhuo first refined it, the spiritual essence was only at thirty-six percent.

However, increasing spiritual essence is not particularly difficult.

One only needs to find the corresponding relics.

Back then, when Ning Zhuo increased the spiritual essence for Ai Dasheng, it was done in one go.

After Cheng Bai created it, its spiritual essence was heavily consumed, dropping to below ten percent.

Burning personal items from the storage bag immediately boosted its spiritual essence to over ninety percent.

Since obtaining the Ice Snow Weather Sphere, Ning Zhuo had been using various channels, including the black market and branch channels, to collect Ning Xie's items.

Through these efforts, he continuously accumulated its spiritual essence.

After Ning Zhuo extorted the Ning family patriarch for the second time, he obtained some family-used magical artifacts.

The inner armor magical artifact being burned was Ning Xie's primary defense during his lifetime.

After being burned, it immediately filled the final gap in its spiritual essence, reaching ten percent.

Of course, what Ning Zhuo obtained from the Ning family patriarch was not just this.

He also received a promise from the patriarch—the Ning family would use all its resources to help Ning Zhuo measure his innate talent.

Ning Zhuo had to show a strong desire for this!

For a young genius cultivator with innate talent but unaware of its specifics, unable to further develop, it would be unreasonable not to explore his own talent's secrets.

"Fortunately, this matter is handed over to the Ning family's main branch. They definitely won't let me easily measure my talent." Given the rivalry between the main and branch families, the patriarch's side would surely create obstacles and secretly interfere.

"Don't let me down, main branch," Ning Zhuo silently cheered for the main branch.

Ning Zhuo also obtained special permissions from the patriarch.

He was permitted to collaborate with the Zhou and Zheng families to jointly explore the Lava Immortal Palace.

This way, even if Ning Zhuo personally helped the Zhou and Zheng families achieve good results, he wouldn't be criticized by his clansmen for betraying the family.

He was also permitted to vigorously develop "Substitute Puppets," necessitating increased collection of clan members' flesh and blood.

With the patriarch's endorsement, Ning Zhuo cleared many invisible obstacles.

Finally, the patriarch extracted many Golden Core Stage materials like Red Sun Copper from the family treasury.

Ning Zhuo's grand and vigorous project to refine Golden Core Stage mechanisms began.

Dozens of Zheng family artifact refiners devoted themselves to the refining room day and night, continuously hammering the Mysterious Iron.

To melt the Golden Core materials, Zheng Hua was invited to use the Heavenly Talent Stone to solve the problem.

Zheng family, Heaven-character refining room.

This was the highest specification refining room in the entire Zheng family, no, in the entire Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

The blazing earth flames were vast and mighty, yet condensed into a small lamp flame.

Magical artifact—Heavenly Worker Lamp!

This was the Zheng family's treasured item, capable of concentrating infinite firepower into a single point.

Any artifact refining technique used within the lamp flame would at least double in effectiveness.

At this moment, within the lamp flame, a black snake was slithering.

The black snake was extremely fierce! Its body was flat, constructed from countless iron strips.

As it moved, the iron strips collided, producing a series of crisp clanging sounds.

Zhu Xuanji and several other Golden Core cultivators stared intently at the lamp flame, focusing on the mechanical black snake within.

Several Golden Core cultivators displayed their abilities, using various spells to investigate.

Moments later, Zhu Xuanji, who used the Heavenly Talent Eyes, was the first to notice something.

Subsequently, two Golden Core cultivators from the Zheng family and two from the Zhou family also noticed the peculiarity.

Zheng Shuangjun said, "The final component of this mechanical weapon is located at its seven-inch position. This position is crucial, serving as one of the central points for the weapon's operation and transformation."

"Without this part, we can only control the three basic forms of the mechanical weapon!"

"We need an extremely sturdy and flexible material to complete it."

The cultivators discussed for a while.

Zhou Nongying first suggested Jade Smooth Steel, Zheng Danlian proposed Dragon Scale Iron, Zheng Shuangjun mentioned Purple Mist Cool Gold, and Zhu Xuanji suggested Moonlight Cold Iron.

Finally, when the second Golden Core ancestor of the Zhou family mentioned Night Wind Soft Iron, everyone's eyes lit up, and they unanimously agreed that this material was the most suitable!

Zheng Shuangjun stroked his chin, "If we use Night Wind Soft Iron, the fire refining method must be pure. Using fire fiend power for refining is absolutely out of the question."

Zheng Danlian added, "The key is the cooling process."

"Night Wind Soft Iron contains vitality, and extreme cold tempering is unsuitable. Using such a method would greatly damage the material properties of Night Wind Soft Iron."

A Golden Core ancestor from the Ning family pondered, "This is manageable."

"Our clan has a Qi Refining junior with the Ice Jade Hand. This innate talent's profound meaning lies in containing a trace of vitality within extreme cold."

"Wonderful," Zheng Shuangjun immediately praised, "This way, we only need this junior to cooperate with us, and we won't have to alter our previous refining plan, saving a great deal of time and effort."

After the discussion, the Ning family Golden Core ancestor immediately sent out the order.

Ning Xiaohui's grandmother was overjoyed upon hearing the news.

She eagerly sought out Ning Xiaohui, and upon meeting, grabbed her shoulders, "Opportunity, Xiaohui, your opportunity has arrived!"

Ning Xiaohui's grandmother explained the situation in detail, but Ning Xiaohui still looked incredulous.

Her grandmother urged, "Xiaohui, when you meet the Golden Core ancestors, you must be extremely respectful. They are important figures, and if they even slightly reward you, it will benefit you for years."

Originally very disheartened, Ning Xiaohui's expression gradually changed from numb and dejected to full of anticipation upon hearing this news.

Following her grandmother's instructions, she went to pay respects to Zhu Xuanji and the Golden Core ancestors of the three families, behaving very obediently.

The Ning family ancestor treated her kindly.

Zhu Xuanji nodded slightly at her and explained the current situation.

Upon hearing the need for Night Wind Soft Iron, Ning Xiaohui suddenly recalled a recent rumor.

The rumor said that Ning Zhuo had destroyed a secret residence of the former black market master, looting many precious items.

Among them, it was said there was a large amount of Night Wind Soft Iron.

Ning Xiaohui then said, "Honored ancestors, please allow this junior to report…."

She informed the Golden Core ancestors about the black market, Ning Zhuo, and the Night Wind Soft Iron.

The Ning family ancestor said, "Oh? Ning Zhuo has Golden Core Stage treasure material Night Wind Soft Iron, which is exactly what we need."

He immediately ordered Ning Zhuo to present the item.
