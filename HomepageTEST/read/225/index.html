<div id="chapterContent">Chapter 225: Rumors 

Fei Si suddenly realized, "So, everything aligns perfectly." He then detailed his report to Meng Kui.

Meng Kui pondered, "The method of establishing a foundation with three dantians will undoubtedly be of great help to my grandson, Meng Chong."

"This Demonic Dao Scripture must be securely guarded by our City Lord's Mansion. If it falls into the hands of demonic cultivators, who knows how many lives will be harmed." "Fei Si, go all out to find this True Scripture!" Meng Kui directly issued the order.

With new orders in hand, Fei Si returned to the City Lord's Mansion.

He sat at his desk, deep in thought.

"Where exactly is the Demonic Dao Scripture?"

The first person he suspected was Ning Zhuo!

"This little fellow Ning Zhuo is ambitious. Back then, he was the one who led the charge to eliminate Yuan Dasheng." "At that time, was he so eager to deal with Yuan Dasheng and the Monkey Head Gang just because of the business with the Mechanical Fire Monkeys?" "Or did he already know from some channel about the secret of Yuan Dasheng possessing the True Scripture?" "During the Fire Persimmon Festival, he actively sought my identity waist token... Is there a possibility he was using me?" "However, if Yuan Dasheng had the True Scripture, it should have leaked out after his death and transferred to the most suitable vessel nearby." "At Yuan Dasheng's death, both Ning Zhuo and Yuan Er were present. If the True Scripture leaked, these two would certainly know and benefit from it." "They might have reached some private agreement!" "Wait a moment."

Fei Si's expression changed slightly as he thought of this.

Because he remembered that Yuan Er was assassinated not long after.

And the Monkey Head Gang, painstakingly built by his father, was recently swallowed up by Ning Zhuo.

"Could it be that Ning Zhuo and Yuan Er had a falling out over the spoils, leading the former to kill the latter to silence him?" "Ning Zhuo is indeed suspicious, but also not very suspicious." Fei Si thought deeply.

His reasoning was that Zhu Xuanji had a very strong ability to discern lies.

"Ning Zhuo, with only a third-level Qi Refining Stage cultivation, couldn't possibly deceive Zhu Xuanji." "Oh, he has now obtained the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique from the fourth to sixth levels, probably reaching the fourth level of Qi Refining." "But that makes no difference; it's still the Qi Refining Stage!"

"Unless he has some rare treasure that can resist Zhu Xuanji's scrutiny."

Fei Si shook his head slightly at this thought.

The possibility was too small.

"Given Ning Zhuo's ambitious nature, if he had some rare treasure, he would have been jumping up and down long ago." "He wouldn't have remained ordinary for over ten years, only to gradually emerge at the age of sixteen because of the Lava Immortal Palace." "He and I share the same nature, the same type of person. Heh." "He couldn't have endured for over ten years!"

Fei Si thought long and hard but couldn't figure out any clues.

Since he couldn't think of anything, Fei Si directly issued orders, dispatching people from the City Lord's Mansion to investigate this matter.

One thing puzzled Fei Si.

That was Zhu Xuanji giving Ning Zhuo three days to explain when he left.

"Explain what? Why not explain on the spot?"

"Or did Zhu Xuanji consider other influences?"

"After all, Ning Zhuo is now a renowned genius cultivator of the Ning family."

"Even when beating a dog, you must look at its master. Ning Jiufan indeed contributed a lot during the expedition to the Fire Persimmon Mountain, being the biggest contributor to Zhu Xuanji's mission." "Wait."

"Ning Zhuo's exploration of the Immortal Palace, repeatedly achieving stunning results, could it be because of this Demonic Dao Scripture?" "From this point of view, he might already have considerable Essence Sea cultivation."

Fei Si let his thoughts wander.

He wasn't a divine constable, so he guessed freely without any psychological burden or concern for evidence.

"In any case, enhancing the investigation is necessary."

Fei Si found that he lacked crucial clues, and the information was too scarce to support a correct judgment.

Soon, Fei Si mobilized the forces of the City Lord's Mansion.

On one hand, he dispatched officials to conduct visits everywhere.

On the other hand, he activated spies to probe Ning Zhuo's true situation.

A night passed.

Golden Core Stage ancestors were exchanging information.

"This little fellow Ning Zhuo has many spies around him."

"He has risen so quickly; it's normal for other forces to have spies around him." "Some aren't even spies, just selling information to outsiders."

The subordinates gathered around Ning Zhuo had limited loyalty to him.

Especially those former stewards, who were dismissed by the main branch openly because they were corrupt and embezzled to varying degrees.

What exactly happened between Ning Zhuo and Zhu Xuanji? External forces, big and small, were all curious and came to inquire.

Many former stewards took the opportunity to sell information.

Whether for profit or sent by the Ning family patriarch and others, or those with ulterior motives, they were all actively moving in secret.

They had no idea that six Golden Core Stage cultivators were making a fuss around Ning Zhuo.

All their actions were clearly seen by the six Golden Core Stage cultivators.

These people, with the highest cultivation at the Foundation Establishment Stage, couldn't detect the methods of the Golden Core Stage ancestors.

"That Ning Xiangguo is the most suspicious!" Zhu Xuanji said while communicating with the three Golden Core Stage ancestors.

Ning Xiangguo was a spy from the City Lord's Mansion.

He had been personally turned by Fei Si in his early years and was one of Fei Si's most effective agents for probing the Ning family's information.

When Ning Zhuo attacked Ning Xiaoren, he had actively sought Fei Si's help.

Fei Si secretly ordered Ning Xiangguo to participate in the action, taking the opportunity to infiltrate Ning Zhuo's side.

During the fall of the Ning family’s young patriarch, Ning Xiangguo indeed played a significant role.

After Ning Zhuo established the black market, Ning Xiangguo also held an important position, performing various tasks excellently.

However, his identity had long been discovered by Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo's Life-Hanging Thread Divine Ability could, to some extent, detect the loyalty of his subordinates.

Ning Zhuo held back, only assigning Ning Xiangguo heavier tasks to fully utilize his abilities.

This arrangement by Ning Zhuo unexpectedly played a clever role now!

Zhu Xuanji and others misunderstood— "Did the City Lord's Mansion send Ning Xiangguo to probe for treasures and prepare for the next assassination?" The three Golden Core Stage ancestors, upon learning about Ning Xiangguo, couldn't help but speculate.

Ning Xiangguo's shrine made the six Golden Core Stage cultivators even more nervous.

They remained fully alert until the afternoon, but no signs of assassination appeared; everything was calm and peaceful.

Not only did the Golden Core Stage ancestors not encounter an assassination, but they also heard a rumor.

This rumor spread throughout the city at an incredible speed.

The content of the rumor was simple: the Ning family's genius cultivator, Ning Zhuo, secretly possessed a Demonic Dao Scripture.

This demonic True Scripture had a significant origin, coming from the Lava Immortal Palace and created by the three sects' elders.

Ning Zhuo, relying on this demonic cultivation, achieved remarkable results in exploring the Lava Immortal Palace.

And Lord Zhu Xuanji discovered this clue, which is why he made a grand appearance yesterday to question Ning Zhuo about the True Scripture's whereabouts.

"How could there be such a rumor?"

"Who spread it?"

"For it to spread so quickly throughout the city, the person behind it is not simple." The Golden Core Stage ancestors sensed something was wrong, smelling a conspiracy.

None of them suspected Ning Zhuo.

Because since yesterday, Ning Zhuo had been under their surveillance, even for basic needs.

The only external communication was a reply to Fei Si.

Moreover, the content of the rumor was clearly detrimental to Ning Zhuo, inciting others' hostility towards him.

As the victim of the rumor, how could he have spread it himself?

The rumor reached others' ears.

"Ning Zhuo has the Demonic Dao Scripture!" Ning Xiaohui, upon hearing the rumor, widened her eyes, showing joy and anticipation.

"If it's true, that would be great. A dignified member of the Ning family, a righteous cultivator, secretly practicing demonic arts." Meng Chong felt excited about the rumor: "Using the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique without WildSprint Thunderclap is not satisfying!" "The Demonic Dao Scripture suits me better, strengthening the body and charging at the front lines. This is too thrilling!"

Zhou Zeshen and Zhou Zhu exchanged thoughts, both believing part of the rumor was obviously false, but some parts seemed genuine.

This left them puzzled, unsure of what to believe.

Many thought Ning Zhuo indeed possessed a demonic True Scripture! Some even fabricated false evidence to convincingly prove it.

Yang Chanyu stood at the vegetable market, overlooking the rooftops.

Sun Lingtong's small figure hid in her shadow.

Yang Chanyu slowly opened her eyes, having been using a spell to eavesdrop on the surrounding sounds.

"Our rumor release was very successful!" "But I'm curious."

"What did that Ning family genius Ning Zhuo do to provoke you into framing him like this?"

Sun Lingtong had prepared for this; he chuckled, "I've been watching Ning Zhuo for a long time. He will be a very useful pawn." Sun Lingtong didn't want to reveal his true relationship with Ning Zhuo to Yang Chanyu.

After all, he had invited Yang Chanyu for help, and his own strength couldn't restrain her.

Even though they had a marriage contract, it only bound them and didn't help Ning Zhuo much.

If Yang Chanyu knew Sun Lingtong's actions were just for Ning Zhuo, she would immediately see it as his greatest weakness.

Even if she didn't act now, she would harbor dark thoughts in the future.

Sun Lingtong changed the topic, "This level of rumor is not enough." "Next, we can continue to spread the second layer of rumors."</div>
