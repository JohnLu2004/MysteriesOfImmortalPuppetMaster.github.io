With the final soft thud, the Buddha Gate disappeared, replaced by a seamless wall that blended perfectly with its surroundings.

"I did it!" Ning Zhuo was overjoyed, barely able to contain his laughter.

Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit: ????

It was stunned, frozen like a statue.

It took a moment for its gaping mouth to twitch and close slightly.

Then, it threw its head back and roared furiously, spewing a massive column of fire from its throat.

Ning Zhuo pressed on, managing to seal the Demon Gate as well, leaving no trace on the surface.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit went berserk, bouncing around the main hall, slamming its head into pillars and floor tiles, making the entire Lava Immortal City shake violently.

At the mountain's peak, fire and lava erupted together, wildly out of control.

Meng Kui sighed and activated the grand formation, exerting all his strength to subdue the raging Lava Immortal City.

This was the most intense eruption in the city's history.

Meng Kui guarded the formation for a full day and night before the city finally calmed down.

So exhausted! Even with his Nascent Soul cultivation, Meng Kui struggled to withstand the Lava Immortal City's repeated outbursts.

After this ordeal, his face showed signs of weariness, with dark circles under his eyes and a much paler complexion.

Soon, thick smoke covered him, obscuring his appearance and figure.

After his soul returned to his body, Ning Zhuo took a Phoenix Soul Blood Fragrance Pill and fell into a deep sleep.

While Meng Kui was laboriously suppressing the city's turmoil, Ning Zhuo slept soundly.

After a day and night, Ning Zhuo woke up feeling refreshed, with most of his soul power restored.

The Phoenix Soul Blood Fragrance Pill proved to be highly effective.

Ning Xiao Ren came to visit.

Ning Zhuo, lying in bed, tried to get up, but Ning Xiao Ren stopped him.

With a look of guilt, Ning Zhuo said, "Uncle Xiao Ren, I have let you down. I am deeply ashamed."

Ning Xiao Ren gently reassured him, "This was unexpected. Who could have known the city had such mechanisms? It’s not your fault."

Ning Zhuo nodded, "This incident made me realize my shortcomings. I want to read more books, especially those related to spirituality. Uncle Xiao Ren, you are a good friend of my father; you will help me, won't you?"

"Uh..." Ning Xiao Ren was momentarily taken aback, inwardly cursing but outwardly maintaining a warm smile, "I'll see what I can find for you."

"Rest in bed for a few days, don't overexert yourself and hinder your recovery."

"Yes, Uncle Xiao Ren." Ning Zhuo bowed and then asked, "When will the books be delivered?"

Ning Xiao Ren coughed a couple of times and said, "I'll expedite the process and select the books for you as soon as possible."

Lying in bed, Ning Zhuo also met with Ning Chen, Ning Yong, and others, thanking them for their visits and gifts.

Due to his previous efforts in supporting his peers, Ning Zhuo was quite popular within the reform team, especially among his classmates.

Of course, this was Ning Zhuo's intentional effort.

While they stood by his bedside talking to him, Ning Zhuo secretly used his embryonic divine power to connect each of them with a life thread.

This recent exploration of the Immortal Palace had significantly enhanced his life thread divine power.

He had absorbed nine Illusory True Lotus seeds, causing the lotus joint to grow two new segments.

Additionally, a fingernail-sized leaf had sprouted at the top of the lotus joint.

As soon as Ning Zhuo sensed the embryonic form of his divine power, he realized many things.

"The life thread divine power has greatly improved; connecting my classmates with the life thread is now effortless! The qualitative change is that I can now add life threads to mechanical constructs with sufficient spirituality."

All things have spirituality, but not all are fully spiritual.

The first thing Ning Zhuo thought of was Yuan Dasheng! It was now in the active spirit stage, with full spirituality at tenfold.

That night, after sleeping for most of the day, Ning Zhuo got up and went to his uncle Ning Ze's cultivation chamber to practice.

The guards immediately adjusted their positions, surrounding him protectively.

Amidst the floating clouds around him, Ning Zhuo summoned back the Golden Blood Battle Monkey.

Within the clouds, he used his embryonic divine power on Yuan Dasheng.

After some time, a nearly transparent life thread appeared above Yuan Dasheng's head.

"I did it!" Ning Zhuo was thrilled.

Suddenly, he had a moment of enlightenment and gently tugged on the life thread.

The next moment, the life thread shook and lifted, its end holding a round, crimson spiritual essence.

The crimson essence was radiant, sometimes smooth and glossy, other times forming the cute, chattering head of a baby monkey.

"I've pulled Yuan Dasheng's spiritual essence out!" The instigator, Ning Zhuo, was astonished.

Just as the life thread pulled his soul from his body into the Immortal Palace, he had now achieved something similar.

Yuan Dasheng had no soul, so Ning Zhuo had completely extracted its spiritual essence!

"Wait a moment!" Ning Zhuo took out another mechanical monkey from his storage bag.

This monkey automaton was crafted in collaboration with Zheng Jian, using the facilities of the Zheng family's forging room.

Compared to the Golden Blood Battle Monkey, the materials used were of a much higher grade, generally two to three levels superior.

This was because many things in the Lava Immortal Palace had restrictions based on the level of the challenge.

Following his instincts, Ning Zhuo guided the life thread to connect with the new monkey automaton.

The spiritual essence attached to the life thread smoothly infused into the new mechanical monkey.

The next moment, the monkey automaton opened its eyes, revealing two green lights.

Tree Martial Battle Monkey • Dasheng!

The monkey automaton had a yellow and green color scheme, primarily made from steel vine tree, blazing wind wood, black tortoise star iron, and golden emperor quartz.

The monkey stood eight feet tall, with a slender build, long arms that extended past its knees, and a dignified, martial demeanor.

To fully exhibit its combat prowess, Ning Zhuo designed the Tree Martial Battle Monkey • Dasheng with a jointed skeleton.

It utilized life-rich wood for the body, which could be quickly repaired using grafting techniques even if damaged in battle.

The most critical feature was the array of talisman slots Ning Zhuo had created, totaling six.

Currently, they were occupied by: Strength Talisman, Swift Wind Talisman, Growth Talisman, Black Tortoise Talisman, Diamond Talisman, and Sharp Blade Talisman.

Ning Zhuo initially designed and crafted the Tree Martial Battle Monkey with the intent of training himself and gradually finding a body that closely matched Yuan Dasheng’s combat prowess.

To his surprise, the process went smoother than expected—he directly transferred Yuan Dasheng's spiritual essence into the Tree Martial Battle Monkey!

Without needing Ning Zhuo's command, the calmed spirit of Yuan Dasheng began to control the new body.

It moved continuously, starting with small actions like stretching its fingers, gradually transitioning to walking, and eventually dancing energetically, causing the floating clouds to churn violently.

Before it could create a bigger disturbance, Ning Zhuo promptly stopped it.

"With this, I can keep Yuan Dasheng by my side," Ning Zhuo thought, delighted by this unexpected turn of events.

But the surprises didn’t end there.

Among the books sent by Ning Xiao Ren, Ning Zhuo discovered secrets about the active spirit stage!</div>
