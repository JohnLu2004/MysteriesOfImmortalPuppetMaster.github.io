<div id="chapterContent">Chapter 166: Aftermath of the Viper

Deep into the night.

"Kill, kill them all!" "Charge forward!"

"Take down a Qi Refining Stage cultivator, and you'll be rewarded with a Magical Artifact. Take down a Foundation Establishment Stage cultivator, and you'll become an elder of the gang!" The sharp cries of the monkeys echoed as they launched a ferocious attack under the command of the cultivators.

The attacked gang was both furious and bewildered, unable to comprehend why the Monkey Head Gang was assaulting them!

"Don't be afraid!"

"We have defensive formations protecting us. The Monkey Head Gang will pay a heavy price for their assault." "No matter what madness has driven them to this, the city guards will surely intervene!" The gang elders and leaders were doing their utmost to stabilize morale.

On the top floor of a certain tavern, Ning Zhuo expended talismans to enhance his vision, observing the attack and defense battle with crystal clarity.

The leader of the Monkey Head Gang looked extremely grim, standing beside Ning Zhuo, and whispered, "Sir, if this continues, our Monkey Head Gang will suffer heavy losses!" Ning Zhuo's expression remained indifferent.

The battle raged on for a while.

Ning Xiangguo couldn't bear it any longer: "Young Master Zhuo, should we charge into the fray?" Ning Zhuo shook his head slightly: "There's no need."

The leader of the Monkey Head Gang felt as if he were in the depths of winter, his body and mind both chilled.

Ning Zhuo showed no regard for the Monkey Head Gang, using human lives and monkey lives to wear down the enemy's defensive formation.

It was exceedingly cruel, like a cold-blooded general on the battlefield.

But he had no choice.

After admitting defeat, he not only signed a stringent and harsh contract but also handed over evidence of his plot against Yuan Er to Ning Zhuo.

He had no other path but to obey Ning Zhuo.

The opposing gang cursed vehemently within their defensive formation.

"They've gone mad, the Monkey Head Gang has gone mad!" "When did we ever provoke them?"

"Why haven't the city guards come yet? Are they blind?!"

The enemy was intimidated by the Monkey Head Gang's frenzied assault.

Their strength was inferior to the Monkey Head Gang's; if not for their robust defensive formation, they would have collapsed long ago.

"Leader, should we continue fighting?" "If this goes on, our old comrades will all die!" The elders of the Monkey Head Gang approached their leader, complaining bitterly.

They had, of course, considered fleeing or counterattacking Ning Zhuo, but the nearly twenty Foundation Establishment cultivators standing beside Ning Zhuo made them abandon such thoughts as soon as they arose.

Attacking the enemy gang offered a chance of survival, but going against Ning Zhuo and his men would lead to a far worse fate!

"It's about time. Have the front-line troops withdraw and replace them with the reserve team," Ning Zhuo commanded.

"Yes, sir," the leader of the Monkey Head Gang replied.

"Wait, use this talisman," Ning Zhuo said, taking out a talisman.

The leader of the Monkey Head Gang accepted it with joy: "It's a formation-breaking talisman!"

Shortly thereafter.

With the use of the formation-breaking talisman, the defensive formation collapsed, and the enemy gang's morale shattered.

The dead lay where they fell, and the survivors surrendered.

"What should we do with these captives?" the leader of the Monkey Head Gang asked Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo smiled faintly: "This gang has committed numerous atrocities. Not one of them is innocent. Hmph, they deserve to die! Kill them all." His light words sent chills down everyone's spine.

Even the Foundation Establishment cultivators of the Ning family felt a cold shiver.

Ning Zhuo was only sixteen years old and had lived in the academy until recently.

He had shown the world his talent, his diligence, his cunning, and his defiance of the main branch.

But tonight's battle revealed the cold and ruthless nature deep within him.

Shortly after, the leader of the Monkey Head Gang reported that everything had been done according to Ning Zhuo's orders, and not a single member of the enemy gang survived.

Ning Zhuo clapped his hands and sighed: "Eradicating evil and promoting the righteous path is truly a joyous thing! It's a pity there's no wine, otherwise, we should have a grand toast." Ning Xiangguo smiled slightly and took out fine wine from his storage belt: "I have wine here." Ning Xiangguo poured a cup for Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo praised the wine but did not drink it.

Instead, he handed it to the leader of the Monkey Head Gang: "I bestow this wine upon you. Drink it."

The leader of the Monkey Head Gang quickly thanked him and obediently drank it in one gulp.

"I must congratulate you, Leader," Ning Zhuo said to him. "From now on, the Monkey Head Gang will take this gang's place and make a strong entrance into the black market." The leader of the Monkey Head Gang's Adam's apple bobbed, his heart filled with mixed emotions of anger and hatred.

The Monkey Head Gang had found legitimate work harvesting Fire Persimmons, and after much effort, had cleaned up their reputation.

Now, this battle had undone years of hard work, turning them back into a blacklisted gang!

Ning Zhuo took out a storage bag from his waist and tossed it to the leader of the Monkey Head Gang: "Your performance in today's battle has shown me the loyalty of the Monkey Head Gang. This is your reward." The leader of the Monkey Head Gang thanked him again, opened the bag, and his face changed: "Mechanical Fire Explosive Monkeys?!"

"Indeed," Ning Zhuo nodded. "You've lost too many monkey pets today. These Mechanical Fire Explosive Monkeys will serve as compensation. Serve me well, serve the Ning family well, and you will not be mistreated."

"Thank you, sir!!" The leader of the Monkey Head Gang knelt and kowtowed, his teeth nearly grinding to pieces in anger.

Ning Zhuo had gone too far, pushing them to the brink!

He had the formation-breaking talisman all along but waited until the Monkey Head Gang had suffered heavy casualties before using it.

He did it on purpose, to ensure that the Monkey Head Gang's monkey pets were nearly wiped out, then replaced them with Mechanical Fire Explosive Monkeys.

The leader of the Monkey Head Gang immediately saw through Ning Zhuo's intentions: "He wants to use the Mechanical Fire Explosive Monkeys to deepen his control over the Monkey Head Gang!"

The leader of the Monkey Head Gang felt a deep sense of despair.

With the contract, the evidence, and the Mechanical Fire Explosive Monkeys, Ning Zhuo's three-pronged approach left him and his gang with little hope of freedom.

Very little!

He looked at Ning Zhuo, who was only at the third level of Qi Refining, yet he felt Ning Zhuo's overwhelming dominance.

Many times, cultivation level doesn't mean everything.

The Ning family's members also felt this deeply.

Ning Zhuo's ruthless and decisive methods erased the last traces of underestimation they had for him.

Ning Zhuo then instructed the leader of the Monkey Head Gang: "Go and surround the Crane Beak Gang's base, bring the enemy's heads, and tell the Crane Beak Gang that the black market is now under my control."

"If they don't surrender, they'll end up like these heads!"

"Yes," the leader of the Monkey Head Gang accepted the order and withdrew.

Ning Xiangguo showed a worried expression: "Young Master Zhuo, you said you wanted to take over the black market and asked us to support you."

"We can plan this carefully. We can follow your lead for the next few days; there's no need to rush."

"We've already wiped out one gang tonight. The Monkey Head Gang is already exhausted. To fight another fully intact gang... this..."

"Our control over the current leader of the Monkey Head Gang is solid. We can't easily replicate this with other gang leaders."

"Such a force should help us consolidate the black market in the future. The Monkey Head Gang has already suffered significant losses in this battle. Further bleeding them would be detrimental to the overall situation." Ning Zhuo smiled slightly: "Uncle Xiangguo, there are no outsiders here, no need to call me Young Master."

"We are all from the same branch family."

"As for the Crane Beak Gang, I judge that they are highly likely to surrender."

"I know quite a bit about the black market and have some plans and strategies."

"Uncle Xiangguo, just wait and see."

Seeing that he couldn't persuade Ning Zhuo, and given Ning Zhuo's confidence, Ning Xiangguo and the others stopped their attempts to dissuade him.

Ning Zhuo's eyes turned deep as he recalled his conversation with Sun Lingtong before the operation.

"Brother Sun, this time I will step forward and reclaim our black market!" Ning Zhuo informed Sun Lingtong of his current situation.

Sun Lingtong clapped his hands in excitement: "Haha, wonderful. We brothers worked hard to take down the black market. Now that I'm wanted, it's best for you to take over."

"However, you are a member of the Ning family, one of the three great families. Taking over the black market openly might break the tacit understanding in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, right?" Ning Zhuo smiled slightly: "I've thought it through, it's not a concern."

"First, I will try not to act personally. Initially, I'll use the Monkey Head Gang. The Monkey Head Gang has already cleaned up their reputation. I'll use the excuse of avenging Yuan Er to openly trouble them and force them to comply."

"I and the Ning family's Foundation Establishment cultivators will try not to intervene, letting the Monkey Head Gang charge fiercely."

"Second, I have good relations with the Zhou family and the Zheng family, and I'm also on good terms with the City Lord's Mansion. If it were other members of the Ning family, they would certainly intervene to stop them. But for me to take over the black market, they will only be happy to see it."

"Because they all want to see the Ning family's main and branch families in conflict and internal strife. Although I will greatly offend the main family, these people will support me!"

"Currently, I've been set up by the main family. On one hand, they dismissed a large number of branch family stewards, and on the other hand, they rewarded me heavily, forcing me to share my cultivation resources, attempting to undermine my prestige."

"I have no choice but to seek another path. I'm still young, and breaking the tacit understanding of the Immortal City to extend my hand to the black market is not a big deal. The other three forces will 'understand'!"

Sun Lingtong thought for a moment and nodded, agreeing with Ning Zhuo's analysis: "Brother, you see things clearly. This is indeed a rare opportunity for you to take over the black market as a member of the Ning family."

"Then let's go all out!"

Sun Lingtong continued to analyze: "To quickly take over the black market, the main obstacles are three gangs and three scattered cultivators."

"The three gangs are the Viper Gang, the Turtle Breath Gang, and the Crane Beak Gang. The three scattered cultivators are Feng Heizi, the One-Armed Craftsman, and the Unclean."

"Exactly," Ning Zhuo nodded.

As Chui Xu Ke, he had assisted Sun Lingtong, spending several years integrating the current black market and was very familiar with the forces and individuals within it.

Ning Zhuo said: "The Viper Gang has been the most active, especially after you were wanted. They aggressively took over our base."

"Hmph!"

"This time, I will have the Monkey Head Gang launch a fierce attack on the Viper Gang, killing one to warn a hundred, and establishing our might!"

"Then, with the Ning family's many stewards and the Monkey Head Gang, we will force the Crane Beak Gang to submit."

Sun Lingtong agreed: "That will work! The leaders and elders of the Crane Beak Gang are mostly bullies who fear the strong and prey on the weak. That's how we dealt with them back then."

"As for the Turtle Breath Gang, it will be up to you, Brother Sun," Ning Zhuo said to Sun Lingtong.

Sun Lingtong laughed heartily: "Who would have thought that the mysterious Turtle Breath Gang today was once just a group of beggars practicing the Turtle Breath Technique to enter a hibernation state and stave off hunger."

"It was you, Little Zhuo, who saw their plight and potential, and had me secretly teach their leader some thieving techniques."

"These beggars were also resilient and gradually developed into the current Turtle Breath Gang."

"I will personally step in and secretly order the leader of the Turtle Breath Gang to stay by your side, both to monitor and to await my return."

The leader of the Turtle Breath Gang did not know Chui Xu Ke's true identity and had always been grateful to Sun Lingtong.

On the surface, the Turtle Breath Gang and Sun Lingtong seemed distant.

In reality, the Turtle Breath Gang had always been a loyal subordinate of Sun Lingtong.

A significant portion of Sun Lingtong's intelligence came from the Turtle Breath Gang.</div>
