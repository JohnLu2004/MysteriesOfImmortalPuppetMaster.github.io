<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The intense clash between the Shadow Demon Cultivator and Fairy Chanyu erupted with thunderous explosions, startling the entire Fire Persimmon Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
Unexpectedly, this battle unfolded suddenly, turning the entire Fire Persimmon Immortal City into a battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight was destined to be a night of fierce and chaotic conflict.<br/>
<br/>
The incident occurred abruptly while Fei Si was still handling official duties at his desk.<br/>
<br/>
Upon hearing the news, he immediately grabbed the seal on his desk, infused it with mana, and activated part of the city's defensive formation to observe the battle.<br/>
<br/>
He even replayed the previous battle scenes.<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si squinted his eyes, a sharp glint flickering within them.<br/>
<br/>
From Fairy Chanyu's appearance to her subsequent actions, he sensed a strong aura of conspiracy.<br/>
<br/>
Reacting swiftly, he immediately ordered the activation of the entire City Lord's Mansion's defensive formation to its maximum capacity.<br/>
<br/>
Then, he sent someone to report the urgent situation to Meng Kui.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, he commanded the city guards to gather the people of the City Lord's Mansion and instructed them not to act rashly.<br/>
<br/>
Given the unclear situation, he needed to assess the circumstances before making a move.<br/>
<br/>
Fairy Chanyu suddenly appeared near the City Lord's Mansion, carrying the Demonic Dao Scripture.<br/>
<br/>
This Demonic Dao Scripture was evidently the key treasure that had been the subject of intense discussion throughout the city recently.<br/>
<br/>
Fairy Chanyu was being pursued and attacked by the Shadow Demon Cultivator, who deliberately revealed that she had the Demonic Dao Scripture.<br/>
<br/>
It seemed as if Fairy Chanyu had just stolen the scripture from the City Lord's Mansion and was intercepted by the Shadow Demon Cultivator midway.<br/>
<br/>
"This is clearly a frame-up!" Fei Si remained expressionless.<br/>
<br/>
He reminded himself, "The enemy is in the dark while we are in the light. The enemy has devised various schemes and tricks, and they must have anticipated our response. Therefore, we must not act rashly to avoid falling into their trap."<br/>
<br/>
Just as Fei Si finalized his strategy, he heard a familiar roar.<br/>
<br/>
"Shadow Demon Cultivator, you finally show yourself. Let's see where you can run this time!"<br/>
<br/>
A short, one-eyed middle-aged man with bulging muscles, resembling a stone pillar, soared into the sky and charged fiercely at the Shadow Demon Cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
The newcomer was none other than Meng Kui's right-hand man, Chi Dun.<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si's vision darkened momentarily, and he gritted his teeth in anger, "That fool Chi Dun!"<br/>
<br/>
Chi Dun charged aggressively.<br/>
<br/>
He had no interest in the Demonic Dao Scripture and focused solely on attacking the Shadow Demon Cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
The Shadow Demon Cultivator was actually Sun Lingtong in disguise.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Chi Dun, a Golden Core Stage cultivator, relentlessly pursuing him with a murderous intent, even Sun Lingtong felt immense psychological pressure.<br/>
<br/>
"What's going on?"<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, at Ning Zhuo's residence.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Shuangjun and Zhou Nongying were hiding, communicating through sound transmission.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight, it was their turn to guard Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of them acted hastily.<br/>
<br/>
After exchanging thoughts, they also worried that this might be a ploy by the enemy to lure them out and create a defensive loophole around Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Boom!<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Chi Dun about to catch up to him, Sun Lingtong, disguised as the Shadow Demon Cultivator, quickly took out a bottle of pills and smashed it on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Instantly, the black powder turned into a massive black smoke, rapidly spreading and obscuring everyone's vision.<br/>
<br/>
Chi Dun, without any hesitation, charged into the thick smoke like a raging bull.<br/>
<br/>
Near Ning Zhuo's residence.<br/>
<br/>
"Is that the Shadow Demon Cultivator?" Zhou Nongying asked.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Shuangjun frowned deeply, using a detection spell to investigate the rapidly spreading black smoke, "It's hard to say. This black smoke seems both real and fake." As he spoke, he took out his signature weapons, the Sun and Moon Twin Hooks, holding them in his hands.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing his companion eager to join the battle, Zhou Nongying quickly stopped him, "Calm down. We must wait for Lord Zhu Xuanji and other Golden Core cultivators to arrive before taking action. If you can't be sure, then this Shadow Demon Cultivator might not be real. It could very well be Fei Si's trick!"<br/>
<br/>
Previously, Fairy Chanyu had suddenly attacked Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
After that incident, Zhu Xuanji and others discussed and believed there was a possibility.<br/>
<br/>
That possibility was that Fairy Chanyu and the City Lord's Mansion were colluding, with the former being hired by Fei Si.<br/>
<br/>
If that were the case, then the current battle between Fairy Chanyu and the Shadow Demon Cultivator was a staged performance by the City Lord's Mansion to deal with Zhu Xuanji's side, deliberately spreading a third layer of rumors.<br/>
<br/>
The overall plan wasâ€”since the public suspected that the City Lord's Mansion had the Demonic Dao Scripture, they would now stage a play where the Demonic Dao Scripture was taken by someone else, proving that the City Lord's Mansion no longer had the scripture.<br/>
<br/>
Boom! Boom!<br/>
<br/>
Deep within the spreading black smoke, a series of terrifying explosions erupted.<br/>
<br/>
Clearly, within the black smoke, Fairy Chanyu and the Shadow Demon Cultivator were engaged in an even more intense battle.<br/>
<br/>
Fairy Chanyu snorted coldly, seemingly suffering a severe injury, and shouted, "Shadow Demon Cultivator, I'll remember you! If you want this scripture so badly, then go ahead and take it." As she spoke, everyone saw a pink light shooting out from the black smoke.<br/>
<br/>
The pink light contained a stone tablet.<br/>
<br/>
Shortly after, the Shadow Demon Cultivator suddenly burst out of the black smoke, chasing after the Demonic Dao Scripture with all his might.<br/>
<br/>
At that moment, many Golden Core cultivators who witnessed this scene felt a pang of greed.<br/>
<br/>
Who wouldn't want to obtain the Demonic Dao Scripture?<br/>
<br/>
Even though they had already formed their Golden Cores and couldn't change their cultivation techniques, the Demonic Dao Scripture was connected to the Lava Immortal Palace and the three major sects, making it incredibly valuable.<br/>
<br/>
Even if they couldn't use it themselves, offering it to other forces or trading it would yield immense benefits.<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, everyone's attention was drawn to the Demonic Dao Scripture flying through the air.<br/>
<br/>
The Demonic Dao Scripture traced a long arc in the sky above Fire Persimmon Immortal City, falling towards a certain corner.<br/>
<br/>
And that corner was near Ning Zhuo's residence.<br/>
<br/>
This made Zhou Nongying and the eager Zheng Shuangjun feel a sense of unease.<br/>
<br/>
"This is probably the City Lord's Mansion's trick," Zhou Nongying thought to himself. "Brother Zheng, quickly take this scripture away to prevent it from causing chaos and endangering Ning Zhuo's life."<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Shuangjun, holding his twin hooks, soared into the sky, heading straight for the Demonic Dao Scripture.<br/>
<br/>
In a nearby house.<br/>
<br/>
A Golden Core disciple of the Great Purity Palace also felt a strong urge.<br/>
<br/>
He had been lurking near Ning Zhuo's residence.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, he had been investigating the source of the rumors, coveting the Demonic Dao Scripture.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Core disciple of the Great Purity Palace believed that if he could obtain the scripture, it would greatly benefit his quest for the Lava Immortal Palace!<br/>
<br/>
Even if he didn't obtain the Lava Immortal Palace in the future, the Demonic Dao Scripture would still be valuable to him.<br/>
<br/>
Whether used to cultivate his own forces or offered to the Great Purity Palace, it would be beneficial.<br/>
<br/>
So when he saw the Demonic Dao Scripture falling near him, he immediately felt a strong urge to seize it.<br/>
<br/>
He quickly took out a set of pitch-black clothes from his storage ring.<br/>
<br/>
"Fortunately, I prepared in advance."<br/>
<br/>
If Ning Zhuo, Zheng Shuangjun, and Chi Dun were present, they would notice that this set of pitch-black clothes was very similar to those worn by the Shadow Demon Cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
It turned out that the Golden Core disciple of the Great Purity Palace, due to his righteous identity, found it inconvenient to act directly in many matters.<br/>
<br/>
Upon hearing about the Shadow Demon Cultivator, he immediately set about forging these clothes.<br/>
<br/>
After all, what did the deeds of the Shadow Demon Cultivator have to do with a disciple of the Great Purity Palace?<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Shuangjun flew forward, seeing the Demonic Dao Scripture within reach, and reached out to grab it.<br/>
<br/>
A pitch-black figure suddenly collided with him.<br/>
<br/>
Boom!<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Shuangjun, holding a hook in one hand, struck fiercely.<br/>
<br/>
He and the Shadow Demon Cultivator, the Golden Core disciple of the Great Purity Palace, clashed, both retreating, and the resulting shockwave sent the Demonic Dao Scripture flying into the air.<br/>
<br/>
"How is there another Shadow Demon Cultivator?!" Zheng Shuangjun was shocked.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Core disciple of the Great Purity Palace landed on the ground, immediately rising and soaring into the sky.<br/>
<br/>
With a casual wave, he used his mana to form a large hand, grabbing at the falling Demonic Dao Scripture.<br/>
<br/>
"Don't even think about it!" This time, Zheng Shuangjun intercepted the Golden Core disciple of the Great Purity Palace.<br/>
<br/>
He shattered the mana hand with a single hook.<br/>
<br/>
The Shadow Demon Cultivator, Sun Lingtong, was also rushing towards the Demonic Dao Scripture but was further away.<br/>
<br/>
Chi Dun followed closely, keeping a tight watch on him.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong felt frustrated, "Chi Dun, this brute, has no brains. The Demonic Dao Scripture is right there, yet he insists on chasing me."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong glanced at the battlefield, feeling puzzled about the identity of the second Shadow Demon Cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
Chi Dun's thoughts were simple: "No matter who the real Shadow Demon Cultivator is, I'll just catch the nearest one and beat him up."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong ran with all his might, using the buildings of Fire Persimmon Immortal City to hinder Chi Dun's pursuit.<br/>
<br/>
Chi Dun, being from the City Lord's Mansion, was somewhat restrained, allowing Sun Lingtong to delay him for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Zheng Shuangjun and the Shadow Demon Cultivator, the Golden Core disciple of the Great Purity Palace, were locked in a fierce battle.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Sun Lingtong approaching, Fairy Chanyu suddenly appeared, directly at the location of the Demonic Dao Scripture.<br/>
<br/>
Fairy Chanyu grabbed the Demonic Dao Scripture again, smiling brightly.<br/>
<br/>
She flew with the Demonic Dao Scripture, intending to slip into a hidden passage through the Fire Persimmon Immortal City's formation and escape the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
A golden light suddenly shone down!<br/>
<br/>
Fairy Chanyu was enveloped in the golden light, her speed drastically reduced.<br/>
<br/>
Within the golden light, Zhu Xuanji's figure emerged, descending from the sky.<br/>
<br/>
Fairy Chanyu repeated her trick, "Want the Demonic Dao Scripture? Here, take it!" This time, she threw the Demonic Dao Scripture directly to the Shadow Demon Cultivator, the Golden Core disciple of the Great Purity Palace.<br/>
<br/>
But Zhu Xuanji ignored the Demonic Dao Scripture and continued to pursue Fairy Chanyu.<br/>
<br/>
Fairy Chanyu, unable to enter the hidden passage in time, had to temporarily change direction, fleeing while casting spells to attack Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
The Shadow Demon Cultivator, the Golden Core disciple of the Great Purity Palace, didn't expect "good fortune" to come his way!<br/>
<br/>
He took a step back and grabbed the Demonic Dao Scripture.<br/>
<br/>
The moment he touched the Demonic Dao Scripture, he felt he had comprehended many profound techniques.<br/>
<br/>
"Demonic Blood Vein Technique!" The Golden Core disciple of the Great Purity Palace's eyes widened with joy.<br/>
<br/>
At that moment, he was certain that this was a genuine Demonic Dao Scripture!</div>
