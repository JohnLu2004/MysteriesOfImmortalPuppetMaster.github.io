<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Zhu Xuanji left Ning Zhuo's residence, but he did not withdraw his surveillance on Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
There were still methods left by Zhu Xuanji on Ning Zhuo's body.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji silently observed Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Every action Ning Zhuo took after their separation fell into his eyes without any flaws.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji's brows furrowed slightly, and the strange feeling in his heart never dissipated.<br/>
<br/>
He had previously pondered and unexpectedly discovered that no matter what event it was, Ning Zhuo seemed to be involved.<br/>
<br/>
He couldn't figure out what was strange about it, but checking on Ning Zhuo was just a small matter that didn't take much effort.<br/>
<br/>
"My Golden Eyes Talent, ever since I cultivated it, only a few Golden Core Stage cultivators have been able to hide from it. Ning Zhuo is merely at the Qi Refining Stage; can he really deceive me?" Zhu Xuanji shook his head, after all, he had just personally checked.<br/>
<br/>
"Passed, passed!" the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit shouted.<br/>
<br/>
In the main hall of the Lava Immortal Palace, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had been closely watching Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
When Zhu Xuanji found Ning Zhuo, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit almost collapsed to the ground, muttering, "It's over, it's over!" But it did not expect that Ning Zhuo actually managed to hide from Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
Even though Zhu Xuanji personally checked all three of his dantians, he found nothing amiss.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was in a state of great excitement, jumping up and down on the throne. "He passed, he actually passed Zhu Xuanji's inspection! Unbelievable, truly unbelievable. He actually has such a trick up his sleeve. This is fantastic, truly fantastic. Hahaha..."<br/>
<br/>
As it laughed, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit suddenly froze, becoming as still as a sculpture.<br/>
<br/>
It felt very embarrassed. "Why am I suddenly so happy for Ning Zhuo?" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit exhaled a breath of turbid air and gradually relaxed. "No matter what, Ning Zhuo has passed this crisis. Next, he should deal with Ning Xiaohui's issue, right? That won't be difficult for him! He managed to deceive Zhu Xuanji, he can definitely handle this."<br/>
<br/>
"He is very resourceful and quick-witted. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I would never have believed that someone at the Qi Refining Stage could toy with Golden Core Stage cultivators like this. If such a person grows, what will become of him?!"<br/>
<br/>
When Ning Zhuo was laying out his plan to Sun Lingtong and others, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was also watching the entire process.<br/>
<br/>
Despite witnessing Ning Zhuo's entire scheme, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit couldn't fathom the reason behind Ning Zhuo's arrangements.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn't until the whole matter concluded that the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit suddenly realized Ning Zhuo's strategy and was in awe, bowing in admiration.<br/>
<br/>
"This is simply too miraculous. The more I resisted Ning Zhuo before, the more I feared him. Now, I admire him even more."<br/>
<br/>
"He's too powerful! Ning Zhuo will definitely solve Ning Xiaohui's problem. Without the trouble from the Historical Records Pavilion, there will be no leverage against me. At that time, who can suspect me, who will suspect me? I will surely gain my freedom!"<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit paced around, head held high, just as excited as Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
It couldn't help but want to contact Ning Zhuo and urge him to act quickly, but just as it was about to speak, it slowly closed its mouth.<br/>
<br/>
It didn't dare!<br/>
<br/>
"This little guy Ning Zhuo is too cunning. He managed to deceive Zhu Xuanji, which is truly terrifying. His preparations are very thorough. Even though he is only at the Qi Refining Stage, he can deceive a Golden Core Stage cultivator. The Buddha Heart Demon Seal is not the biggest contributor to this; it's that flower his mother left him. What exactly is that flower?" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was filled with curiosity.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji was alone.<br/>
<br/>
He wrote another letter to the royal family for help.<br/>
<br/>
The current situation was very different from before.<br/>
<br/>
The Zheng family's Golden Core cultivator had seized the Demonic Dao Scripture.<br/>
<br/>
This wasn't very important; what truly affected the situation was that Zheng Danlian had killed a true disciple of the Great Purity Palace.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, this matter was loudly proclaimed by Luo Shang.<br/>
<br/>
If it hadn't been proclaimed, the matter would have been easier to handle.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji could have represented the Zheng family to negotiate with the Great Purity Palace and secretly make amends.<br/>
<br/>
But now that it was proclaimed, the world knew that a true disciple of the Great Purity Palace had fallen at Zheng Danlian's hands.<br/>
<br/>
As a super sect, the Great Purity Palace had to make a statement to maintain its reputation.<br/>
<br/>
This put Zheng Danlian under immense pressure.<br/>
<br/>
If not handled properly, it could not only cost him his life but also implicate the entire Zheng family.<br/>
<br/>
So, should the Zheng family be protected or not? Zhu Xuanji personally wanted to protect them, but his personal ability was insufficient.<br/>
<br/>
To protect the Zheng family, he needed the power of the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, Zhu Xuanji also had to consider the royal family's stance and the overall situation of the Southern Bean Kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to the Great Purity Palace, the Southern Bean Kingdom's overall strength was undoubtedly much stronger.<br/>
<br/>
This was because the Southern Bean Kingdom could unite the Meng family, the Su family, and other major cultivation families to form a cultivator army.<br/>
<br/>
Sects often excelled at training elite disciples, occupying relatively more resources, and focusing on cultivating high-level combat power.<br/>
<br/>
In direct confrontation, even if all disciples were gathered, they would struggle to resist the army of a cultivation kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
This was different from ancient times.<br/>
<br/>
In ancient times, cultivation arts had not fully developed, and cultivation level was the primary measure of individuals and forces.<br/>
<br/>
Each level of cultivation, from Foundation Establishment to Golden Core to Nascent Soul, represented a qualitative leap.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, high-level cultivators could often fight many opponents at once, dominating the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
But now, with the development of various cultivation arts, there had been tremendous progress! For example, mechanical constructs could be assembled and refined using Golden Core-level materials to form Golden Core-level combat power.<br/>
<br/>
Even if the one controlling the mechanical construct was only a Foundation Establishment cultivator, they could use the construct to overcome the gap in cultivation and defeat a higher-level cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
This is the progress of the times! This progress has also transformed the relationships between kingdoms, sects, and families.<br/>
<br/>
Historically, for a long time, cultivation sects were the dominant force in the world, the best form of organizational power.<br/>
<br/>
Even if there were kingdoms, they were mostly mortal kingdoms, controlled behind the scenes by cultivation sects.<br/>
<br/>
But now, with the development of various cultivation arts, low-level cultivators could indeed use high-end materials to form higher-level combat power.<br/>
<br/>
This has led to the numerical advantage of cultivators being highlighted once again.<br/>
<br/>
A large number of low-level cultivators, given enough resources and technology, could, to some extent, contend with higher-level cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
However, no royal family of any cultivation kingdom would underestimate a super sect.<br/>
<br/>
These sects often produced highly skilled individual elites.<br/>
<br/>
If these elites launched assassinations against members of the royal family, it would undoubtedly cause great headaches for any royal family.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, from the royal family's perspective, they usually maintained good relations with these super sects.<br/>
<br/>
After all, the talents cultivated by these super sects were also highly sought after by various cultivation kingdoms.<br/>
<br/>
Super sects continuously sent their disciples to serve in various cultivation kingdoms to expand their influence.<br/>
<br/>
In summary, if the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family wanted to protect the Zheng family, they could most likely do so.<br/>
<br/>
Unless the Great Purity Palace received resources or guarantees from other major forces and wanted to target the entire Southern Bean Kingdom, the Great Purity Palace would most likely compromise with the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji was not a member of the Southern Bean Kingdom, so he couldn't make decisions on such important matters for the King of the Southern Bean Kingdom.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, he could only write a letter to report this important matter and express his opinions and thoughts in the letter, but he would not interfere with the King's judgment.<br/>
<br/>
If the King wanted to protect the Zheng family, Zhu Xuanji would welcome it with open arms.<br/>
<br/>
If the King decided to abandon the Zheng family, Zhu Xuanji would also be willing to carry out the order.<br/>
<br/>
In his letter, Zhu Xuanji also requested to review a series of intelligence reports related to the Night Rain Demon Weapon.<br/>
<br/>
In the City Lord's Mansion, Chi Han stood in front of Fei Si, his face looking bad, shouting loudly, "That Golden Core cultivator from the Zheng family seized the Demonic Dao Scripture. This scripture is very important. I personally encountered it during the battle; it's called the Demonic Blood Vein Technique. After analyzing it, although I didn't get much content, I can confirm that this Demonic Blood Vein Technique is compatible with the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique. We must find the Golden Core cultivator from the Zheng family and try to get this Demonic Dao Scripture. It would be greatly beneficial to us."<br/>
<br/>
"If they learn it, Young Master Meng Chong's leading position might be at risk."<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si's face turned ugly. "You reckless fool! I ordered you to hold back, but you charged ahead. The Demonic Dao Scripture is important, but it's not the most important thing. The current situation is very dangerous, and you don't understand it. Don't block my way; I need to see the City Lord."<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si immediately flew to the top of Fire Persimmon Mountain to consult with Meng Kui. "City Lord, Yang Chanyu appeared near my City Lord's Mansion, carrying the Demonic Dao Scripture, looking like she wanted to escape. But she was intercepted halfway by the Shadow Demon Cultivator, who revealed that Yang Chanyu had seized the Demonic Dao Scripture. This is clearly a setup against my City Lord's Mansion, aiming to let the world know that the Demonic Dao Scripture is indeed in my mansion. My investigation into the source of the rumors has yielded some results."<br/>
<br/>
"The most crucial third layer of rumors is being secretly pushed by the Zheng family, the Zhou family, and the Ning family together."<br/>
<br/>
"If this trend continues, I am very worried that the competition for the Lava Immortal Palace will escalate, get out of control, and ultimately harm innocent civilians in the city."<br/>
