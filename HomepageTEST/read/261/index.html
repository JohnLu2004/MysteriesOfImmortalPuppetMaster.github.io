<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The children's orphanage.<br/>
<br/>
The five-story theater building.<br/>
<br/>
This is the tallest building in the orphanage and was often used by Li Leifeng for performances during his lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
Almost every charity event was held here.<br/>
<br/>
Though it was morning, many cultivators had already gathered.<br/>
<br/>
The theater building is structured in a square shape, with a central hall set up for performances.<br/>
<br/>
For Zhu Hou's succession, the stage had been newly arranged.<br/>
<br/>
On either side of the stage, two vermillion pillars had been added, each engraved with two lines of characters—"Benevolent Heart, Broad Charity" and "Virtue Over the World."<br/>
<br/>
Below the stage were a dozen round tables.<br/>
<br/>
Around the tables were round stools.<br/>
<br/>
Many cultivators sat, enjoying the refreshments on the tables while chatting leisurely.<br/>
<br/>
A few stood in the corners, engaging in quiet conversations.<br/>
<br/>
All of them were dressed in luxurious robes, their manners refined, and their voices low, exuding an air of elegance.<br/>
<br/>
Their discussions revolved around Li Leifeng, Zhu Hou, and donations.<br/>
<br/>
They subtly probed each other, trying to gauge how much each would donate at Zhu Hou's succession ceremony.<br/>
<br/>
Donations were a delicate matter.<br/>
<br/>
Too high or too low could be problematic.<br/>
<br/>
Some donated more for fame, while for others, the reputation of the righteous path became a burden.<br/>
<br/>
Even if their pockets were tight, they had to donate large sums.<br/>
<br/>
In these probing exchanges, people feigned politeness, joked, bluffed, and hinted, finally relaxing after gaining some insight.<br/>
<br/>
The topic soon shifted to the beast siege.<br/>
<br/>
"Until now, the City Lord's Mansion hasn't requested aid from the Southern Bean Kingdom. This means the situation is still under control. Although Fire Persimmon Immortal City is newly built, it can hold its ground!" "Any Scarlet Flame Demon Beast, regardless of type, has valuable parts once it falls. So, in a way, this beast siege is a spirit stone tide!" "Hahaha..." Everyone laughed.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, because the Lava Immortal Palace bore the brunt of the beast tide, the situation in Fire Persimmon Immortal City remained stable, and the citizens' morale stayed high.<br/>
<br/>
Some had a clear understanding of the situation: "The real key to this beast tide isn't Fire Persimmon Immortal City, but the Lava Immortal Palace!" "You might not know the situation at the mountain top. Most of the view is obscured by clouds and smoke." "I heard from a friend who entered the Immortal Palace that the beast tide there is truly terrifying!" "If not for Lord Meng Kui's urgent mobilization, bringing many golden core cultivators to the Immortal Palace battlefield, the Lava Immortal Palace couldn't have held on." "If the Lava Immortal Palace falls, Fire Persimmon Immortal City won't stand either!"<br/>
<br/>
This insightful view was met with disdain by the surrounding cultivators, who generally thought this cultivator was too pessimistic.<br/>
<br/>
The cultivator insisted, not backing down: "The clouds and smoke at the mountain top are proof. The City Lord's Mansion doesn't want us to see the truth. Why?" "Because they're worried that if we see the real beast tide, our morale will plummet, and we'll flee when we can, which would be detrimental to the overall situation."<br/>
<br/>
"There's another piece of evidence. You've all heard the rumors about uniting all cultivators, including those from the Demonic and Evil Sects, for city defense." "If the pressure wasn't great, why would the City Lord's Mansion do this?" "It's precisely because the front line is tight and the pressure immense that they need to mobilize all forces!" This statement quickly drew laughter.<br/>
<br/>
Opponents argued confidently: "Fool! The City Lord's Mansion is doing this to keep those from the Demonic and Evil Sects under control. The previous golden core chaos was a warning. Unregulated cultivators are truly troublesome and can cause big problems if not watched."<br/>
<br/>
"Sigh... If not for the recruitment order, Fire Persimmon Immortal City wouldn't have so many mixed people." "The City Lord's vision is broad, but I wish the Lava Immortal Palace would let us handle it alone..." The opponent's words were echoed by others.<br/>
<br/>
"Such rumors are baseless!"<br/>
<br/>
"I don't believe the City Lord's Mansion would stoop to recruiting demonic and evil cultivators. It disgraces the righteous path and our Southern Bean Kingdom." "Such evil outsiders should operate in the shadows, in dark corners." "Look around here, in this grand hall, do you see any from the Evil or Demonic Sects?" More people agreed: "Yes, yes." "Makes sense."<br/>
<br/>
"Brothers, I have a question. I recently heard that the monkey head gang plans to organize a team to clear out lone Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts and join the city defense. Are they considered evil?" "Of course!"<br/>
<br/>
"Hmph, the founder of the monkey head gang, called Yuan Yi, I know him. He rose by relying on a monkey pet named Yuan Dasheng." "He's no good, rising from the bottom and annexing many small gangs."<br/>
<br/>
"The monkey head gang was decent, but recently they destroyed the viper gang and joined the black market. It's laughable."<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, has the current leader of the monkey head gang lost his mind? Making such foolish decisions. Once tainted by black, it stays black. They'll never mix with the righteous path again, their potential capped." "I don't think so. I believe the new leader of the monkey head gang is quite shrewd. He's betting big, backing a powerful ally. You should know, the current black market leader is Ning Zhuo, a member of the Ning family, a righteous disciple!" "Ning Zhuo, I know. Before the golden core chaos, there were rumors of a true scripture with him. It turned out to be false."<br/>
<br/>
"In my opinion, he's foolish. Abandoning a good righteous identity for a few coins, tainting himself with the black market. Short-sighted, cutting off his righteous future. Even with talent, his life will be marred by this, pointed at by others."<br/>
<br/>
Just then, the doors opened.<br/>
<br/>
The cultivator responsible for leading guests stood at the entrance, loudly announcing:<br/>
<br/>
"Divine Constable Zhu Xuanji has arrived—!"<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Family's Young Master Ning Zhuo has arrived—!"<br/>
<br/>
The previously lively hall fell silent.<br/>
<br/>
Cultivators turned to look.<br/>
<br/>
A middle-aged man with hands behind his back stepped over the high threshold and entered the building.<br/>
<br/>
He had a square face, eyes shining with golden light, wearing a bright red robe with black sleeves, exuding an aura of righteousness and solemnity.<br/>
<br/>
It was Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
The cultivators dared not be disrespectful, rising to greet Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji nodded slightly, expressionless.<br/>
<br/>
Following him by a step, Ning Zhuo also entered the hall.<br/>
<br/>
He was still in white robes, eyes clear and bright, with the youthful face of a sixteen-year-old, yet his demeanor was extraordinary, neither humble nor arrogant, with a determined gaze.<br/>
<br/>
Based on appearance alone, it was hard to believe this handsome youth was the one who took over the black market and wiped out the Viper Gang overnight.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo followed Zhu Xuanji, leisurely ascending the high building.<br/>
<br/>
Those with noble status were arranged in the upstairs private rooms.<br/>
<br/>
This time, Ning Zhuo benefited from Zhu Xuanji's presence.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing them ascend and disappear from view, the cultivators in the hall resumed their seats.<br/>
<br/>
They outwardly changed the topic, but secretly communicated.<br/>
<br/>
"Did you see that, did you see that!" The cultivator who mentioned the monkey head gang leader's backing was excited, transmitting to many.<br/>
<br/>
"Do you think Ning Zhuo is simple?"<br/>
<br/>
"How does a mere qi refining youth sit as the black market leader?"<br/>
<br/>
"Isn't it because of support? The previous black market leader, Sun Lingtong, caused trouble, and with the recruitment order, a stable black market was needed. So the city's upper echelons pushed Ning Zhuo forward." "Ning Zhuo managed to unseat the young patriarch of the Ning family, he's ruthless. He's from a branch of the Ning family but has talent, so he was pushed out to stabilize the black market." "Ning Zhuo thus gained the favor and support of the four major forces in Fire Persimmon Immortal City. He often mingles with the talents of the Zhou and Zheng families, and most criminals he catches in the black market are sent to Fei Si for achievements." "Look at him now, following Zhu Xuanji!"<br/>
<br/>
"Zhu Xuanji didn't bring anyone else, why him?"<br/>
<br/>
"Clearly, Ning Zhuo is valued by Zhu Xuanji! When he leaves the black market, his future will be vast!" "Think a bit, and you'll see!"<br/>
<br/>
Someone hesitated, replying: "But Ning Zhuo's record is unclear as the black market leader."<br/>
<br/>
The cultivator supporting the monkey head gang leader sneered, disdainfully saying: "You saw it, Ning Zhuo, sixteen, he's only sixteen!" "So young."<br/>
<br/>
"There's a saying, 'A prodigal who returns is worth more than gold!'"<br/>
<br/>
"At such a young age, making mistakes is normal. When he returns to the righteous path, his dark past will prove his growth. What's the big deal?" The cultivator finished, nose in the air, feeling superior.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone fell silent.<br/>
<br/>
They wanted to refute, but Zhu Xuanji's public appearance with Ning Zhuo was undeniable evidence.<br/>
<br/>
They were convinced.<br/>
<br/>
Many looked towards the third floor, harboring thoughts of befriending Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
They were all righteous people, previously thinking they shouldn't get too close to Ning Zhuo, the black market leader.<br/>
<br/>
But after today, they realized Ning Zhuo's future seemed bright!<br/>
<br/>
Little did they know, Ning Zhuo was deeply suspected by Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji brought him along to make a move against him.<br/>
<br/>
If Ning Zhuo made a wrong move, Zhu Xuanji might arrest and detain him on the spot.<br/>
<br/>
Once Ning Zhuo lost his freedom, he would be eliminated, losing his chance to compete for the Lava Immortal Palace's leadership!<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji was a prominent figure.<br/>
<br/>
Following him was a golden core true disciple from the Purple Dawn Pavilion.<br/>
<br/>
This true disciple had played the role of a Shadow Demon Cultivator during the golden core chaos and was chased out of the city by Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
He had to reveal the Purple Dawn Pavilion's signature technique to escape Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
This time, he entered, first going upstairs to greet Zhu Xuanji, then returning to his private room.<br/>
<br/>
The whole process was natural, without a hint of awkwardness.<br/>
<br/>
He truly embodied the righteous path's demeanor.<br/>
<br/>
After the Purple Dawn Pavilion's golden core, only some Foundation Establishment figures followed.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, master craftsmen from the artifact workshop, master alchemists from the pill pavilion, or top chefs from the golden feast hall.<br/>
<br/>
Normally, more cultivators would attend this succession ceremony.<br/>
<br/>
Out of respect for the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family, at least two golden core cultivators would be present.<br/>
<br/>
But now, due to the beast siege, everything had to be simplified.<br/>
<br/>
Most golden core cultivators were defending the Lava Immortal Palace and couldn't leave.</div>
