<div id="chapterContent">Chapter 134: Ning, Sun vs Cheng Bai

Cheng Bai cast his spells, ghostly souls danced, and a chilling wind howled.

The patterns of the grand formation were penetrated by countless ghosts, rapidly dissipating.

Cheng Bai no longer held back, his long hair fluttering, his robes billowing, and the aura of his Golden Core Stage spread everywhere.

"If this were the center of the Immortal City Grand Formation, I might not be able to turn the tide."

"But here, it's just the fringes of the formation, and you all have merely drawn part of the protective formation's power by constructing auxiliary formations. How can you stop me!"

Cheng Bai flicked his sleeve, unleashing a fierce ghostly wind, its howling sound piercing the eardrums, aiming to kill Chui Xu Ke and Sun Lingtong.

Ning Zhou, controlling the Blue Iron Armor, carried the still unconscious Sun Lingtong, showing no fear.

"Cheng Bai, if you want to kill us, it's still too early. If you have the guts, come after us!"

The next moment, Ning Zhuo slapped the wall, triggering a hidden teleportation formation.

He and Sun Lingtong were instantly teleported, disappearing without a trace.

Cheng Bai roared in anger, immediately stopping, but the ghostly wind still destroyed most of the teleportation formation.

He quickly flew to the teleportation formation, identifying the formation and materials, then cast a spell.

"Setting up a teleportation formation in the gaps of the Immortal City Grand Formation leaves little room for teleportation. Found it!"

"Haha, do you think you can shake me off with a few teleportation formations? Today, I will kill you both!"

Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong entered another underground base.

Spell—Soul Travel for a Thousand Miles.

Cheng Bai caught up within just a few breaths.

Such speed brought Ning Zhuo immense pressure.

Golden Core Stage cultivators often overpower those in the Foundation Establishment Stage.

Cheng Bai was no ordinary Golden Core; he hailed from the Soul Devouring Sect, possessing superior innate talent, and was a true disciple of the Soul Devouring Sect.

This meant he was absolutely an elite among Golden Cores!

Ning Zhuo continued to activate the Immortal City Grand Formation, temporarily blocking Cheng Bai.

Cheng Bai cast spells, wearing down the formation patterns, sneering: "Very well, Chui Xu Ke, I want to see how many holes you've dug and how many nests you've built in Fire Persimmon Immortal City!"

"Let me tell you the truth, I've planted a mark on Sun Lingtong. As long as you carry him, I can always find you."

"Hahaha, in fact, as long as you stay in contact with Sun Lingtong for a long time, the mark's power will also cover you. If you abandon him now, perhaps I won't be able to find you."

"Once the mark is planted, I will be able to sense you at all times. I will relentlessly hunt you down until you are tortured and killed by me!" Cheng Bai's face was full of killing intent.

He didn't even know why he was so angry, so furious.

He hoped, hoped that Ning Zhuo would abandon Sun Lingtong to save himself.

But Ning Zhuo never did so.

He gritted his teeth in secret and once again teleported away with Sun Lingtong.

"Ah!" Cheng Bai roared towards the sky, feeling like he was driven mad by Ning Zhuo.

Boom, boom, boom!

One underground base after another was overturned by Cheng Bai.

Such a huge commotion had long been detected by the City Lord's Mansion and reported to Fei Si.

Fei Si hurriedly used the Flying Message Technique to report to Meng Kui.

Meng Kui sat cross-legged on a meditation mat, hidden within layers of clouds and mist.

Hearing the report, he couldn't help but smile, the two walnuts rotating in his palm even more smoothly.

"A new Golden Core Stage cultivator?"

"Ghostly aura, seems to be a technique from the Soul Devouring Sect. Could he be a Shadow Demon Cultivator?"

"Oh, and many underground bases have been exposed, all utilizing the gaps between the Immortal City Grand Formation?" Ai Kui felt curious, eager to know what other monsters and demons were hidden in the vast Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

He was in a good mood, sitting leisurely on the mountain, watching the changing clouds and the battles of others, while he remained calm and composed.

Of course, Meng Kui's main focus had always been on the Lava Immortal Palace, never wavering.

The battle at the Lava Immortal Palace was intense.

Countless Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts fell under the formations, Magical Treasures, and various Mechanical Constructs.

Yet the demon beasts were endless.

They charged into the range of the palace's formations, breaking through the first and second lines of defense, even the third line was on the verge of collapse.

This made the Ning Family Patriarch frown deeply: "The offensive of the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts is terrifying. Could it be that the Lava Immortal Palace will gradually float up, unable to suppress Fire Persimmon Mountain anymore?" He mingled within the third line of defense, killing demon beasts while looking around, searching for the secrets within the Lava Immortal Palace.

"If the Lava Immortal Palace is breached, even if one building is overrun by demon beasts, my opportunity will come!" The Ning Family Patriarch was not in a hurry; he was patiently waiting for the right moment.

Meanwhile, dozens of miles away from Fire Persimmon Mountain, Zhu Xuanji's eyes shot out golden light as he cast a spell, gazing at the mountain's peak.

His gaze penetrated the layers of clouds and mist, clearly seeing the battlefield at the Lava Immortal Palace.

"The Lava Immortal Palace is much weaker than I imagined."

"What happened to the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit of the palace? In many places on the defense line, with its abilities, it should be able to do better." "Has it also suffered irreparable damage during the long suppression?" Zhu Xuanji speculated in his heart.

"Meng Kui..." Finally, he fixed his gaze on the Nascent Soul Stage cultivator hidden within the clouds and mist.

"You used the Sitting Mountain Observation Technique, which is the main reason the Lava Immortal Palace suffered a beast horde attack. Once the Immortal Palace is breached by the beasts, you, Meng Kui, will be held accountable!" "Your External Peach Core only has two pieces; I hope you don't overplay your hand." Zhu Xuanji, from the Divine Constabulary and a member of the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family, had extensive intelligence on Meng Kui.

He received a personal reminder from the trapped master to focus on Meng Kui's Sitting Mountain Observation Technique.

Zhu Xuanji knew: although the Sitting Mountain Observation Technique was powerful and mysterious, it had its drawbacks. 

Once this technique was used, Meng Kui had to remain seated and immobile, unable to leave until the fate energy dissipated.

Otherwise, the backlash he would suffer would be terrifying. 

Not only would his physical body and soul be injured, but his fate energy would also plummet to the lowest point and remain there for a long time. 

Meng Kui was well aware of this, so he specially selected immortal materials and spent a fortune to invite a master craftsman to create a pair of External Peach Cores for him. 

Only with these two peach cores could he directly intervene in the fate energy field.

Once the peach core was thrown, it was incredibly powerful, with its first inherent ability being an unavoidable hit! 

Besides this, it had other mysterious properties that even the royal family couldn't uncover. 

This was Meng Kui's core technique, used sparingly and kept in utmost secrecy.

Spell—Ghost Shadows!

The ineffective ghost shadows circled around Cheng Bai, quickly wearing down the formation patterns. 

Ning Zhou activated the teleportation array and disappeared from the spot. 

Cheng Bai, however, sensed Sun Lingtong's position, no longer underground but back on the surface. 

He laughed wildly, his face twisted: "You have dozens of underground bases, well managed!" "But now?" 

"What do you have to stop me!" 

Boom!

The next moment, the underground base erupted in terrifying flames, instantly engulfing Cheng Bai. 

Huff, huff, huff...

Ning Zhuo panted heavily. 

He had continuously abandoned dozens of underground bases, constantly teleporting and retreating to mislead Cheng Bai, all for this final moment. 

"Boss Sun, this location is great. It's deep within Fire Persimmon Mountain, and we can utilize the surrounding formations to construct a trap." When Ning Zhuo first discovered it, he was quite excited and shared his idea. 

Sun Lingtong nodded in agreement, though his expression was somewhat peculiar: "Little Zhuo, you seem to have developed a fascination with explosions lately." 

Ning Zhuo nodded: "Explosions are beautiful." "I love explosions!"

"No matter what triggers the explosion, they will, in an instant, burst forth in their most brilliant and dazzling form." "And the terrifying release of power in that instant is the culmination of countless moments of silent repression." "It might only last a moment, but after the explosion, they will be utterly unrecognizable, perhaps even completely obliterated."

"But it's worth it!"

Sun Lingtong couldn't help but grind his teeth.

In recent years, he noticed that Ning Zhuo had grown up, and his thoughts had become dangerous.

Many times, he didn't know how to persuade him, and couldn't help but feel worried.

After pondering for a moment, Sun Lingtong finally said, "Xiao Zhuo, life is actually very long. There's no need to live so repressively, and even less need to pursue a moment of brilliance." "We cultivators seek longevity, even immortality, don't we?" Ning Zhuo nodded, "Boss, I understand. As long as the green hills remain, there's no fear of running out of firewood."

Sun Lingtong nodded repeatedly, "That's right, that's right. You've been smart since you were young. Be rational, be calm, and make the right choices!"

"Ning Zhuo, you idiot!" Sun Lingtong transmitted his voice to Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhou was pleasantly surprised, "Boss, you're finally awake!"

Sun Lingtong was extremely weak, "Get out of here! Cheng Bai is not an ordinary Golden Core Stage cultivator; he must have planted a mark on me. And you still came over!" "Don't forget, we have an agreement."

Ning Zhou suddenly smiled, "It's too late, Boss, he's here." Cheng Bai, with disheveled hair, appeared once again.

Compared to before, he indeed looked a bit disheveled.

Ning Zhuo's heart sank, and he spoke in Chui Xu Ke's tone, "I didn't expect such an explosion wouldn't even hurt you. Blind Judge, you truly deserve your reputation as a formidable expert." Cheng Bai's Adam's apple bobbed as he let out a mocking laugh, "Only now do you realize the gap between us? You're really senile." "Don't expect a few flattering words to plead for mercy. Die!" As soon as he finished speaking, the Ghost Soul Army flew in, covering the sky and earth.

Ning Zhuo took a deep breath, stomped his foot, and countless Mechanical Thunder Silence Birds flew out from the surrounding houses!

The Thunder Birds self-destructed, fiercely clashing with the Ghost Soul Army.

For a moment, lightning flashed and ghosts wailed, the battle was evenly matched.

Cheng Bai sneered, standing motionless in the air.

Suddenly, a one-horned ghost general appeared behind Ning Zhuo, swinging a ghost-headed broadsword in a horizontal slash.

"When did it sneak up?!" Ning Zhuo was caught off guard and could only turn to block with his left arm.

At the moment the broadsword struck his left arm, a silver light shield flashed on the Mechanical Blue Iron Armor's left arm.

The light shield shattered instantly, but it bought Ning Zhuo the most crucial time.</div>
