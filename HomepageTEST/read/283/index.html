Lava Immortal Palace.

Clang, clang, clang...

The sound of the bell echoed across the square in front of the main hall.

Before thirty-three desks, the expressions of the cultivators were not pleasant.

Some frowned deeply, others had faces as calm as still water, and some felt both physically and mentally whipped upon hearing the bell.

This was because new information had been transmitted to their minds—the first round of the palace examination had ended, and all cultivators were to cease answering questions. Those who disobeyed would be disqualified from the subsequent rounds.

Thus, the cultivators reluctantly put down the jade slips in their hands, their faces filled with bitterness.

"Damn it!"

"I haven't finished answering yet."

"Why did time pass so quickly?!"

"I tried to answer everything, even though I knew some were wrong. But isn't it better to answer than not? Shouldn't I get some encouragement points?" 

The thoughts of the cultivators were similar, as they secretly prayed to pass this round smoothly.

The position of the palace master of the Lava Immortal Palace was at stake, and these people were the elite among those who had infiltrated the Immortal Palace, naturally harboring ambitions. No one wanted to be eliminated in the first round.

Information continued to be transmitted to everyone, instructing the cultivators to wait for a moment as the papers would be graded immediately, and results would be announced.

Thus, the cultivators in the square took this time to quickly exchange answers and discuss the questions with each other.

Zhu Xuanji, however, was lost in thought alone.

At this moment, the Book Master approached him: "Lord Zhu."

The Book Master smiled and asked, "Do you think the frequently mentioned 'Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique' and 'Demonic Blood Vein Technique' in the jade slip, along with the 'Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique', form a set, the supreme arts inherited by the Lava Immortal Palace?"

Zhu Xuanji was pondering this very question. Upon hearing the inquiry, he looked up and admitted, "I was just contemplating the snippets about these two techniques in the test. I think they seem like a set." 

"However, to truly confirm, we would need to consult a cultivator like City Lord Meng Kui for calculations." The Book Master nodded: "I wonder if the Demonic Dao Scripture in Lord Zhu's possession might be for sale?" This was the Book Master's true intention.

During the Golden Core stage melee, the Demonic Dao Scripture appeared, although it was eventually revealed as a fake. But there was still some truth to it, as Ning Zhuo had released some genuine parts of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique to gain trust.

Golden core cultivators who had come into contact with the scripture knew some of the content of the first few layers of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique.

However, the Book Master had not participated at that time.

Despite his desire, he belonged to the All-Book Pavilion, a renowned neutral force that could not casually involve itself in local disputes.

Therefore, the Book Master knew nothing about the Demonic Blood Vein Technique.

He wanted to purchase it from Zhu Xuanji, but was immediately refused.

Before the first palace examination, Zhu Xuanji might have been tempted by the Book Master's high price to sell part of the technique.

But now, having just completed the first round of the jade slip exam, Zhu Xuanji had used some knowledge of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique to answer questions.

This further confirmed the value of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique. At this critical stage of the palace examination, he could not sell it!

The Book Master sighed and had to bid farewell to Zhu Xuanji, seeking other breakthroughs with the Zheng and Zhou families.

Watching the Book Master's departing figure, Zhu Xuanji's gaze was deep.

Currently, the ranking list showed the Book Master in second place, making him Zhu Xuanji's greatest rival.

On the other side.

"Brother, how did you do?" Zheng Shuangjun asked Zheng Danlian with concern.

Zheng Danlian snorted coldly, suppressing his inner frustration.

During the palace examination, he almost wanted to take out his scythe and chop the desk in half!

Zheng Danlian said, "The Three Sects Master is nothing special. Before holding the palace examination, he should have spread the Three Sects Supreme Arts."

Zhou Nongying added, "We've already discussed this. It's likely that the beast attack on the palace caused the examination to be brought forward. Originally, there should have been a transmission of the arts." 

Ning Jiufan agreed, "Or perhaps, in the subsequent stages of entering the Immortal Palace, the Three Sects Supreme Arts should have been included." 

Zheng Shuangjun shook his head with a wry smile, "No matter, no matter, we're all in the same boat, the rankings shouldn't change too much." Almost all the cultivators shared the same thoughts.

Except for Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo.

Zhou Zeshen approached Ning Zhuo to inquire about his feelings regarding this palace examination.

Ning Zhuo smiled bitterly, "This time, I'm afraid I messed up. Alas, I might miss a life-changing opportunity!" Zhou Zeshen felt relieved and comforted him, "Everyone is in the same situation, Brother Ning, don't worry too much."

Ning Zhuo shook his head, "We Qi Refining cultivators can't compare to those Golden Core cultivators. Their perspectives are much broader. Even if they don't know the Three Sects Supreme Arts, they can answer based on their understanding." 

"For us, it's not the same."

Zhou Zeshen nodded, sighing, "I feel the same way, Brother Ning."

In another corner.

Yang Chanyu approached Sun Lingtong.

Sun Lingtong wore a conflicted expression.

Yang Chanyu couldn't help but worry, "Hey, you Foundation Establishment cultivator, how did you do?" 

"You're too young and your cultivation is weak, don't leave too many blanks and get eliminated." 

"If I'm left to participate in the subsequent palace examinations alone, I'll have to increase my share of the profits by another ten percent!"

Sun Lingtong sneered, rolling his eyes at Yang Chanyu, "Woman, just you wait."

He quickly glanced at Ning Zhuo in the distance.

After obtaining the Three Sects Supreme Arts, Ning Zhuo had shared them all with Sun Lingtong!

Ning Zhuo could answer fully, but Sun Lingtong could not.

Because he was acting under Ning Zhuo's name.

Thus, even though he knew the answers to many questions, he couldn't answer them correctly.

Sun Lingtong had to consider the situation when the palace examination results were announced.

Thus, the entire palace examination was extremely conflicting for him.

Balancing this was incredibly difficult!

The cultivators' exchanges were suddenly interrupted by incoming information.

"The first round of the palace examination, the rankings are as follows:" 

"Entry Standard." 

"Book Master." 

"Zhu Xuanji."

The crowd was in an uproar.

The first place was simply too, too, too eye-catching!

"Entry Standard?!" Everyone turned their shocked, angry, hateful, and disdainful gazes towards Sun Lingtong.

Even with Sun Lingtong's audacity, being suddenly targeted by so many people made him involuntarily swallow.

Yang Chanyu snorted coldly, stepping forward to shield Sun Lingtong behind her, she let out a mocking laugh, "Anyone who wants to be disqualified from the Lava Immortal Palace and lose their palace examination qualification, feel free to make a move!"

The eyes of the crowd almost spewed out raging flames.

"This Void Sect!"

"I didn't expect them to infiltrate so deeply, to be so familiar with the Three Sects Supreme Arts!!" 

"If Sun Lingtong knew the Three Sects Supreme Arts, how could he only practice his Boy Arts?" 

"This is clearly cheating, blatant cheating!"

"We worked hard to answer honestly in the palace examination, and this sneaky thief blatantly cheats?!"

"Alas, I should have expected this. Sun Lingtong, being in the Foundation Establishment stage, could enter the Immortal Palace. He took advantage of the high cultivation levels. It seems the Void Sect has grasped a huge loophole in the Lava Immortal Palace!"

"Where is the palace spirit? Someone is cheating!!! Please punish them swiftly!"

The cultivators were furious.

The dragon turtle fire spirit, having observed the entire process, rolled its eyes, feeling utterly powerless.

Because it knew the truth.

It growled, "What you should really be concerned about is Ning Zhuo! That little monster!!" 

Seeing everyone in the dark, seeing "Ning Zhuo" inconspicuously ranked in the middle of the list — this made the dragon turtle fire spirit feel deeply powerless. The chill in its heart grew even stronger.

Sun Lingtong let out a long sigh of relief.

He had successfully completed the task, not letting his score stand out too much, allowing Ning Zhuo to remain hidden.

Yang Chanyu suddenly hugged him.

Such an intimate gesture made Sun Lingtong extremely uncomfortable, and he pushed her away with all his might.

"Yang Chanyu, what are you doing?!" Sun Lingtong shouted.

Yang Chanyu's eyes were fervent, staring intently at Sun Lingtong, "Amazing, you little rascal, you've really brought glory to our Void Sect." 

"How did you do it?"

"Did you really get the Three Sects Supreme Arts, or did you cheat?" 

"Quick, tell me!"

Sun Lingtong shook his head, "Ah, you're so annoying."

Watching Sun Lingtong from afar, Ning Zhuo also relaxed quietly, feeling quite gratified, "The boss is trustworthy!"

The name Ning Zhuo was inconspicuous on the list.

New information was transmitted again.

"Combining the merit list and the examination rankings, the new rankings are as follows:" 

"Zhu Xuanji." 

"Book Master."

"Zheng Danlian." 

"Entry Standard."

Ning Zhuo.

Zhou Zeshen.

"How is this possible?!"

"I — I didn't make it?" 

"Damn it!"

The cultivators in the last ten positions on the list changed color, some cried out in pain, others were disheartened.

Ning Zhuo noticed that there wasn't a single Golden Core cultivator among them, about half were trial disciples, and the other half were Foundation Establishment cultivators.

The Golden Core cultivators' perspectives and knowledge were still deep enough.

The questions in the jade slip were limited to the Qi Refining stage, with a few reaching the Foundation Establishment stage. Therefore, even if the Golden Core cultivators didn't know the Three Sects Supreme Arts, they could cleverly answer based on their knowledge.

On the other hand, the reason no Golden Core cultivator was eliminated was due to their previous merits, ranking high on the list.

The trial disciples who were eliminated suffered from a lack of knowledge.

As for the Foundation Establishment cultivators, it was likely due to both reasons. They lacked merits and their knowledge was not on par with the Golden Core cultivators, showing less effect.
