Ning Jiufan proactively suggested, "Fellow Daoists, why don't we go to my place for a cup of tea first?"<br/>
<br/>
"That sounds good," Zheng Danlian nodded.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan looked at Zhu Xuanji, "Divine Constable, the previous alliance was made rather hastily. Why don't we discuss it over tea?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji smiled slightly, "Then I shall impose upon you."<br/>
<br/>
........<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sat cross-legged on a meditation mat, surrounded by layers of floating clouds.<br/>
<br/>
The Tornado Windmill Magical Artifact was pressed against his chest, slowly rotating.<br/>
<br/>
Under the effect of the magical artifact, a tornado formed within Ning Zhuo's Qi Sea in his middle dantian.<br/>
<br/>
The tornado swept up the surrounding mana, grinding and reducing it as it absorbed, eliminating a large amount of impurities and clearing away the mixed parts, leaving behind the purer essence.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was currently at the peak of the eighth turn of the Qi Refining Stage, with a vast Qi Sea and an abundance of mana.<br/>
<br/>
He continued to activate the magical artifact for a while, which finally made his middle dantian feel a bit lighter.<br/>
<br/>
Originally, he had ten parts of mana, but after purification, only six parts remained.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, these six parts of mana were still mixed, just less so than before, and could still be further purified.<br/>
<br/>
"But this requires me to find another method. Relying solely on the Tornado Windmill Magical Artifact can only achieve this much," Ning Zhuo understood this well.<br/>
<br/>
The growth and purification of mana, corresponding to quantity and quality, was an unavoidable and constant issue in a cultivator's lifelong cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo cultivated the three seas of essence, qi, and spirit simultaneously.<br/>
<br/>
The situation in his Qi Sea was the best, with the Tornado Windmill Magical Artifact available for use.<br/>
<br/>
For the Essence Sea and Divine Sea, he could only purify them by continuously consuming blood qi and divine sense, then using cultivation techniques to generate new blood qi and divine sense—a cumbersome method.<br/>
<br/>
"I should buy some Pure One Pills," Ning Zhuo thought.<br/>
<br/>
This type of pill was the most classic and popular for purifying cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
It was effective for the three treasures of essence, qi, and spirit.<br/>
<br/>
No matter which of the three dantians it was, it could purify accordingly.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo practiced diligently for a while, feeling slightly irritable, and then stopped the three major cultivation techniques.<br/>
<br/>
He took out the Five Elements Ruler, dividing his Five Elements Mana into five separate streams, constantly practicing the Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique.<br/>
<br/>
Since obtaining this technique, he had been practicing it the most among all his techniques.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's progress in this area was visible to the naked eye.<br/>
<br/>
After practicing the technique for a while, Ning Zhuo returned to cultivating the three major techniques.<br/>
<br/>
After several rounds, Ning Zhuo felt his body reach the limit of operating the techniques and finally stopped.<br/>
<br/>
He also stopped practicing the Five Elements Mutual Generation and Restraint Technique, put away the Floating Cloud Cloak, and concealed his true cultivation, showing only the appearance of a three-layer cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
He left his residence, accompanied by four former deacon guards at the Foundation Establishment Stage, and headed to the Ning family estate.<br/>
<br/>
"I need to consult some ancient texts," Ning Zhuo arrived at the Secretary Pavilion.<br/>
<br/>
The Ning family's library was open to the public, but the Secretary Pavilion was a higher level, accessible only to the family's elite.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, Ning Zhuo was certainly qualified.<br/>
<br/>
He entered the Secretary Pavilion and searched around, while the four Foundation Establishment guards showed knowing smiles.<br/>
<br/>
Because Ning Zhuo was consulting texts related to dual cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
"Hahaha, Young Master Ning Zhuo is already sixteen years old."<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, he's growing from a boy to a man."<br/>
<br/>
"However, I started reading these when I was eleven," the four Foundation Establishment cultivators communicated privately.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo consulted for several hours, then walked out of the Secretary Pavilion with a frown and a thoughtful expression.<br/>
<br/>
On the way back to his residence, he sat in the carriage, deep in thought.<br/>
<br/>
After this consultation, he had a deeper understanding of dual cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
"The most mainstream method of dual cultivation is the union of yin and yang."<br/>
<br/>
"Men are yang, women are yin. The union of yin and yang generates the power of two elements, which can create life and enhance cultivation."<br/>
<br/>
"But this method has significant drawbacks."<br/>
<br/>
"As Brother Sun said, using another's qi during cultivation leads to impure qi."<br/>
<br/>
"If you don't want to affect your foundation and future, you must purify and remove the other's qi."<br/>
<br/>
"Thus, after dual cultivation, you need to purify and refine. Without good methods, the results of dual cultivation are not as good as solitary cultivation."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo also learned that the union of pure yang and pure yin yields the best results in dual cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
However, this means the other's qi deeply integrates into one's own, making it impossible to remove completely.<br/>
<br/>
The best approach is to form a Dao companion with the partner.<br/>
<br/>
"No wonder so many people become Dao companions!"<br/>
<br/>
"But if one Dao companion dies, the other's cultivation will suffer greatly."<br/>
<br/>
"The risk is too high!"<br/>
<br/>
"It's not worth it."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo preferred solitary cultivation and would never exchange his pure yang for temporary rapid progress, leaving a huge hidden danger for the future.<br/>
<br/>
"My previous dual cultivation was just a shallow union of yin and yang, without problems."<br/>
<br/>
"The acquired qi can be completely removed with enough effort."<br/>
<br/>
"Additionally, dual cultivation with nature, the union of heaven and man, is a way with fewer foreign qi."<br/>
<br/>
Cultivators absorb the qi of heaven and earth, the yang qi of the sun, and the yin qi of the moon, which is of this type.<br/>
<br/>
"Even the union of heaven and man requires self-purification."<br/>
<br/>
"Is there a way for me to dual cultivate with myself? This way, I wouldn't need purification afterward."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's idea was that if dual cultivation with others caused foreign qi issues, then dual cultivation with himself would eliminate the problem at the root, making purification unnecessary.<br/>
<br/>
This was theoretically feasible.<br/>
<br/>
Because normal personal cultivation is "yang qi moves to generate yin, yin qi stills to form yang," achieving harmony of yin and yang.<br/>
<br/>
Men are primarily yang, with more yang qi than yin qi, using yang qi to generate yin qi.<br/>
<br/>
Women are primarily yin, with more yin qi than yang qi, using yin qi to generate yang qi.<br/>
<br/>
"Is there a way to extract my own yin qi, place it in a mechanical component, let it operate through some method, and increase yin qi?"<br/>
<br/>
"When I need dual cultivation, I can extract this yin qi."<br/>
<br/>
"Since the yin qi originates from my body, it is one with me. Thus, after dual cultivation, no purification is needed!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo instinctively thought of mechanical constructs.<br/>
<br/>
It must be said that previous dual cultivation had given Ning Zhuo great inspiration.<br/>
<br/>
Before, he wanted to create a Golden Core Stage mechanical body for Yuan Dasheng to help him break through in cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had a rather enticing mechanical design idea—mechanical puppets that could help cultivators progress faster!<br/>
<br/>
"I've already figured out the path for Yuan Dasheng."<br/>
<br/>
"Using the blood and flesh voluntarily contributed by clan members, and Yuan Dasheng's ability to use the Demonic Blood Vein Technique, I can obtain a continuous supply of refined blood."<br/>
<br/>
"After purification, this refined blood becomes extra essence treasure for my cultivation!"<br/>
<br/>
"As for dual cultivation..."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was still contemplating.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest technical challenge was how to make the yin qi grow on its own!<br/>
<br/>
"I could create a puppet, refine its spirituality, and let it use its learned techniques to increase yin qi."<br/>
<br/>
"If there's no suitable candidate to make into a puppet, I need to find a true scripture specifically for increasing yin qi."<br/>
<br/>
"No,"<br/>
<br/>
"I cultivate the three major techniques. If the puppet uses another method to increase yin qi, it won't be natural growth and will have the nature of another method."<br/>
<br/>
"If I absorb too much, I still need to purify."<br/>
<br/>
"Unless..."<br/>
<br/>
"I create a fourth technique based on the three major techniques, specifically for increasing yin qi!"<br/>
<br/>
At this thought, Ning Zhuo immediately shook his head.<br/>
<br/>
The method of cultivating the three dantians simultaneously was already extremely rare and precious.<br/>
<br/>
Based on his understanding of yin and yang and the three major techniques, it was impossible to create a fourth technique.<br/>
<br/>
"This path is not feasible," Ning Zhuo sighed, continuing to immerse himself in thought.<br/>
<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan and Zhu Xuanji had already reached the third round of tea.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan held a mechanical demon general in his hand, using it as a major bargaining chip, demanding Zhu Xuanji's promise—to protect the Ning family, even if they lost the competition for the Lava Immortal Palace, they needed to arrange for the Ning family to migrate to another Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, Ning Jiufan's wiser move was to involve the Zhou and Zheng families.<br/>
<br/>
Without mentioning the exchange of interests, Ning Jiufan hoped Zhu Xuanji would make the same promise to these two families!<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji pondered for a long time, calculating the cost multiple times, and finally nodded with difficulty, agreeing.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, the three Golden Core families were overjoyed and immediately signed a higher-level alliance with Zhu Xuanji!<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji paid a huge price but finally obtained the mechanical demon general.<br/>
<br/>
"Offering this up will surely elevate my status in the Lava Immortal Palace, a qualitative leap!"<br/>
<br/>
"Alas, I also took a big gamble!" Zhu Xuanji bet on himself.<br/>
<br/>
In this way, at the critical moment of competing for the Immortal Palace, he could gain strong support from the three families.<br/>
<br/>
Afterward, if he defeated the Fu family, he wouldn't need to arrange for the Zhou, Zheng, and Ning families to migrate.<br/>
<br/>
The mechanical demon general looked fierce and rough on the outside, but its internal structure was precise and meticulous, like a human body.<br/>
<br/>
Due to severe damage in many places, the mechanism couldn't be activated.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, Zhu Xuanji's next important task was to repair it.<br/>
<br/>
When Zhu Xuanji finally got the mechanical demon general in his hands and carefully inspected it, his face changed drastically, sinking to the bottom.<br/>
<br/>
He stared at a piece of mechanical iron plate in his hand.<br/>
<br/>
A blood path diagram plate!<br/>
<br/>
"This mechanical diagram plate is smooth. There should have been a true scripture recorded here."<br/>
<br/>
"Where did the true scripture go?"<br/>
<br/>
A true scripture is written with true intent.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to ordinary scriptures, it can perfectly convey the mysteries of the scripture and the author's intended meaning to others.<br/>
<br/>
The Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao.<br/>
<br/>
Words and language are often vague and weak.<br/>
<br/>
But not with a true scripture!<br/>
<br/>
"Because a true scripture contains true intent, it will transfer itself when a more suitable vessel appears."<br/>
<br/>
"Let me see..."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji used his innate talent eyes and activated the Tracing Origin Technique.<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, he saw a scene from the past.<br/>
<br/>
The battlefield was in chaos.<br/>
<br/>
The mechanical demon general, under the control of the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, charged through the demon beasts, fearless.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, it was caught off guard, defeated, and fell.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit quickly retreated.<br/>
<br/>
The mechanical demon general became a war trophy, passing through many hands.<br/>
<br/>
But none of them could comprehend the true scripture.<br/>
<br/>
Until a young monkey touched the mechanical demon general while playing.<br/>
<br/>
The true scripture on the diagram plate was triggered and immediately transferred from the iron plate into the young monkey's body!<br/>
<br/>
"Wait."<br/>
<br/>
"This young monkey looks familiar!"<br/>
<br/>
"Strange."<br/>
<br/>
"Why do I feel a vague sense of familiarity?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji's face showed a puzzled expression.</div>
