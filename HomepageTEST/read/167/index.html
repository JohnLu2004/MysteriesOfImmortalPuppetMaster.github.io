The first leader of the Crane Beak Gang was a herb gatherer who possessed a family heirloom, the Crane Beak Hoe Magical Artifact, which was highly effective in harvesting wild spiritual plants.

The herb gatherers banded together to resist extortion and eventually formed the Crane Beak Gang.

Thus, the foundation of this gang was not particularly strong.

During Sun Lingtong's era, the Crane Beak Gang surrendered under pressure.

When Sun Lingtong was wanted, the Viper Gang rose to prominence and seemed poised to dominate the black market.

The Crane Beak Gang was the first to offer congratulations.

Now, as the leader of the Monkey Head Gang presented the head of the Viper Gang's leader as a greeting gift to the Crane Beak Gang, the leader of the Crane Beak Gang felt no shame or threat, only deep emotion. 

"Watching him build his grand mansion, watching him host guests, and now watching it all collapse." 

Not long ago, the Viper Gang's leader was full of vigor, but now only his head remained, his eyes wide open in death.

The Viper Gang, which had seemed to dominate the black market, had disintegrated overnight.

"The old leader was right!" 

"Those who kill will be killed in return."

"Fighting and killing should only be done when absolutely necessary."

"Our way of life is fine as it is, gathering herbs, selling them for money, and paying some protection fees."

"There is always a higher mountain; there will always be someone stronger than you."

"Without innate talent, excellent spiritual roots, or a reliable background, to survive in this world, one must become a herb, a spiritual plant. Contribute fruits, show value, rather than flaunt monkey teeth." The leader of the Crane Beak Gang sighed deeply in his heart.

He had his own survival strategy.

The leader of the Monkey Head Gang warned him that the Monkey Head Gang was intervening in the black market, backed by the Ning family, and hoped the Crane Beak Gang would recognize the situation.

The leader of the Crane Beak Gang said he would convene the elders of the gang to discuss and asked the leader of the Monkey Head Gang to wait a moment.

The leader of the Monkey Head Gang waited only for the time it takes to drink a cup of tea before receiving the response from the Crane Beak Gang's leaderâ€”the Crane Beak Gang was willing to submit, but the specific terms needed to be discussed face-to-face with Ning Zhuo.

The leader of the Monkey Head Gang was overjoyed.

The battle to annihilate the Viper Gang had caused significant casualties, and they urgently needed to recuperate.

The Crane Beak Gang's submission was the best outcome.

He laughed, "Smart choice! Come with me, don't keep Young Master Zhuo waiting."

Ning Xiangqian stood by the window, staring at the Crane Beak Gang's stronghold, his brows furrowed, constantly monitoring the situation.

The leader of the Monkey Head Gang had been inside for some time without any sign, making Ning Xiangqian increasingly anxious.

"Why is there still no movement?" He couldn't help but look at Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo sat in the main seat, not having stood up since he sat down.

Clusters of white floating clouds enveloped him, tightly concealing all fluctuations of his cultivation.

"Such diligence..." Ning Xiangqian thought.

Before publicly supporting Ning Zhuo at the clan's ancestral hall, he had never interacted closely with Ning Zhuo.

This time, Ning Zhuo invited them to act together, intervening in the black market, marking Ning Xiangqian's first collaboration with Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo's various behaviors were truly unexpected for him. "Diligent in cultivation, seizing every moment!" "Very capable, not at all like a recent graduate from the academy." "But still young, a bit impulsive in actions!"

Ning Xiangqian believed that Ning Zhuo's order for the leader of the Monkey Head Gang to persuade the Crane Beak Gang was too aggressive and risky.

The leader of the Monkey Head Gang was crucial in helping Ning Zhuo control the entire Monkey Head Gang.

The battle to annihilate the Viper Gang had shown the Ning family the value of the Monkey Head Gang's leader.

He commanded well in the battle, effectively mobilizing all the gang members, continuously boosting morale, and maintaining the army's spirit.

This showed that the third leader was well-liked and had sufficient control over the entire Monkey Head Gang.

No one else could match his influence in the gang.

"If the leader of the Monkey Head Gang were to die, it would be difficult to control the entire gang, and it might fall apart." This was Ning Xiangqian's greatest concern.

Footsteps approached, and then the door was knocked.

Ning Xiangguo's voice came through, "Young Master Zhuo, the leader of the Monkey Head Gang has completed his mission. He has brought the leader of the Crane Beak Gang to see you."

Ning Xiangqian was taken aback.

He had been watching from the window and hadn't seen anyone leave the stronghold.

It turned out the leader of the Crane Beak Gang had brought the leader of the Monkey Head Gang through an underground passage.

Specific terms needed to be discussed and negotiated to be finalized.

According to the terms, the Crane Beak Gang's submission would be determined.

The leader of the Crane Beak Gang entered the room and bowed to the floating clouds.

The clouds gradually dispersed, and Ning Zhuo's cold voice came through, "Since you are surrendering, why hesitate to see me?" "Kneel!" Ning Xiangqian immediately shouted coldly.

The leader of the Crane Beak Gang hesitated, feeling the pressure of numerous divine senses locking onto him.

The gazes of the Ning family's Foundation Establishment cultivators also rested on him.

Under the pressure, he gritted his teeth and knelt.

The clouds dispersed, and Ning Zhuo saw the leader of the Crane Beak Gang.

To Ning Zhuo, the latter was an old acquaintance.

The leader of the Crane Beak Gang had seen Chui Xu Ke many times but was seeing Ning Zhuo for the "first time." He didn't know that Ning Zhuo was Chui Xu Ke's secret identity.

"Too young!" The leader of the Crane Beak Gang's first impression was this.

Ning Zhuo was only sixteen years old, really too young.

This youthful face gave the leader of the Crane Beak Gang a surge of courage.

He began to propose his own terms, attempting to retain the right to act independently.

Ning Zhuo sneered, "It seems you haven't recognized the current situation. What you hold are all delusions and fantasies!" The leader of the Crane Beak Gang said, "Lord Ning Zhuo, perhaps I can bring you unexpected help. For instance, you seem to want to unify the black market. You may not yet know that there are three major gangs in the black market. Any individual or force wanting to control the black market cannot bypass these three major gangs."

"Now, among these three gangs, the Viper Gang has been annihilated by you, my Crane Beak Gang has also submitted to you. The third gang is the most mysterious and has always been little known, but its influence is immense."

Ning Zhuo chuckled, "You mean the Turtle Breath Gang?"

"Uh." The leader of the Crane Beak Gang was momentarily stunned.

Ning Zhuo looked towards the door, his gaze seemingly able to penetrate through, "By my calculations, he should be arriving soon."

The next moment, the Ning family cultivators outside shouted, "Who goes there?!"

"I am the leader of the Turtle Breath Gang, persuaded by the envoy to come and pledge allegiance to Lord Ning Zhuo." A middle-aged man's voice came through.

Ning Zhuo laughed heartily, "Invite him in."

The leader of the Turtle Breath Gang, dressed in black, walked in.

Behind him were two Ning family Foundation Establishment cultivators, their expressions wary, transmitting messages to others, "Be careful! This person's stealth skills are strong; it wasn't until he was within a yard of me that my Magical Artifact's alarm was triggered."

The Ning family Foundation Establishment cultivators immediately became solemn, their gazes and divine senses enveloping the leader of the Turtle Breath Gang.

The leader of the Turtle Breath Gang remained expressionless, feeling a bit disdainful.

He had been taught by Sun Lingtong and was very skilled in stealth.

He had only revealed his presence voluntarily just now to be discovered.

If he had used his full abilities, even standing behind the Ning family cultivators, they wouldn't have noticed.

"It's really you!" The leader of the Crane Beak Gang exclaimed, feeling incredulous.

In his knowledge, the Turtle Breath Gang was very mysterious, without a regular stronghold, and its members' identities were often unknown to each other, usually maintaining single-line contact.

Even during Sun Lingtong's time, the Turtle Breath Gang remained independent.

When the Viper Gang rose and took over Sun Lingtong's territory, the leader woke up one morning to find a letter from the leader of the Turtle Breath Gang on his bedside.

This incident spread quickly, causing the Viper Gang to become much more restrained.

"How could such a gang, such a leader, suddenly pledge allegiance to Ning Zhuo?!" The leader of the Crane Beak Gang was very puzzled.

"So Ning Zhuo really has a strategy and plan!" "Besides us, this genius youth seems to have another force at his disposal." "Remarkable, his intervention in the black market was not a spur-of-the-moment decision but a well-thought-out move!"

For a moment, the Ning family's Foundation Establishment cultivators frequently cast admiring glances at Ning Zhuo.

Despite having only "Qi Refining Stage Level 3" cultivation, such methods commanded respect.

The leader of the Monkey Head Gang was awed by Ning Zhuo.

He had heard many rumors about the Turtle Breath Gang.

Ning Zhuo had quietly subdued this gang, far exceeding his expectations.

"The Turtle Breath Gang has always dealt in intelligence. With such personnel to monitor us, we must be extremely cautious under Ning Zhuo's command!" The leader of the Monkey Head Gang felt even more burdened.

He had initially planned to make some small moves, but the Turtle Breath Gang's allegiance made him abandon those thoughts.

The leader of the Monkey Head Gang took a deep breath and suddenly spoke, loudly congratulating Ning Zhuo for unifying the black market, turning clouds into rain overnight, with astonishing achievements.

The leader of the Turtle Breath Gang remained silent.

The leader of the Crane Beak Gang, however, turned pale.

The Turtle Breath Gang's allegiance had thrown him into disarray.

Ning Zhuo had become overwhelmingly powerful, and his Crane Beak Gang was too weak to negotiate.

Unexpectedly, Ning Zhuo shook his head at the leader of the Monkey Head Gang's flattery. "Far from it."

"To control the black market, at least three gangs and three wanderers must be mastered."

"Now, the Viper Gang has been replaced by the Monkey Head Gang, and the Crane Beak Gang and Turtle Breath Gang have submitted to me. Next, we need to deal with Feng Heizi, the One-Armed Craftsman, and the Unclean."

Hearing this, the Ning family cultivators looked at each other in confusion.

They were unfamiliar with the black market's inner workings and were hearing these names for the first time.

The leader of the Crane Beak Gang turned even paler.

The leader of the Turtle Breath Gang remained expressionless, but his pupils contracted slightly.

Ning Zhuo's deep understanding of the black market surprised them all.</div>
