Zhu Xuanji's expression changed as he made a new discovery.

He immediately ordered the trial disciples to retrieve a severed arm from the pile of discarded items.

The severed arm was deep red, shimmering with a golden hue, and exuded a heavy, sinister demonic aura.

"The quality is very high, definitely Golden Core Stage material. And it's not a single material; it's a new composite created using alchemical methods," Zhu Xuanji murmured to himself.

"Is this also a construct from the Lava Immortal Palace?"

"What kind of construct would use such materials?"

Zhu Xuanji's mind instantly recalled the three major constructs of the Lava Immortal Palace—Dao Master, Buddha Healer, and Demon General.

"Could this be the arm of a fallen Demon General?" Zhu Xuanji naturally speculated.

Greatly intrigued, he ordered the trial disciples to retrieve the crimson iron severed arm.

But they failed.

One trial disciple, with a bitter expression, said, "Master Zhu, I can't do it. My contribution is too low."

Zhu Xuanji laughed, "No matter. The Lava Immortal Palace is not peaceful; there are continuous attacks from Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts. You can use this opportunity to accumulate a large amount of contribution." 

After the trial disciples followed his instructions, Zhu Xuanji discovered that the contribution they earned from killing the same Scarlet Flame Demon Beast was significantly higher than that of others.

He also found that trial disciples could occasionally receive critical information, providing them with more ways to earn contributions.

In contrast, others rarely received proactive messages from the Immortal Palace, and the primary way to earn contributions was by slaying Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts.

However, this method was fraught with danger.

On the other hand, trial disciples had a broader range of options.

For example, they could retrieve construct parts from the discard room for repair and assembly.

Zhu Xuanji observed their actual gains and was surprised to find that the earnings from these repair tasks were comparable to slaying Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts.

"Is this the treatment enjoyed by those who practice the techniques provided by the three sects?" "In comparison, we are clearly being treated differently..."

Zhu Xuanji felt a pang of emotion.

For a moment, Zhu Xuanji entertained a fleeting fantasy of switching his cultivation path.

But it was just a fleeting thought.

He was already at the Golden Core Stage.

If he were still in the Foundation Establishment Stage, there might be a slight chance of reconsidering and starting over.

Once a Golden Core is formed, the foundation is set, and it is impossible to start over in this lifetime.

The saying "Golden Core has no regrets" holds true.

The trial disciples accumulated contributions rapidly, and soon someone had enough to exchange for the crimson iron severed arm from the discard room.

Zhu Xuanji touched the severed arm and used his Golden Eyes talent and Tracing Origin Technique to investigate.

He saw an underground lava cave.

The cave was vast, with numerous pillars of varying thickness supporting the cave walls.

A gigantic demon ape, exuding Golden Core Stage aura, was sleeping with its eyes closed.

In one of the stone pillars where it slept, there was a cavity storing the demon ape's various spoils of war.

Among them was a severely damaged construct puppet.

"Demon General Construct!!" Zhu Xuanji's eyes lit up.

"Judging by this, the underground lava cave should be the demon ape's lair, similar to a royal court." "The Demon General Construct fell here, but if I can retrieve it, I will surely gain a large amount of contribution." "If I can repair it and return it, the contribution should be even greater!"

Zhu Xuanji easily deduced that retrieving the Demon General Construct would far exceed the total contribution he had previously earned by donating three quasi-Golden Core constructs.

This was because the Demon General Construct itself was a Golden Core combat power and perfectly matched the Lava Immortal Palace's original constructs.

The King's recruitment order led Meng Kui to lift the blockade on the mountain top and the Immortal Palace.

Many people flocked to the Lava Immortal Palace, most of whom were rejected at the gates, but a few met the standards and were allowed entry.

The Lava Immortal Palace became even more bustling than before the blockade.

Zhu Xuanji also felt the pressure of competition.

He urgently needed to gain a large amount of contribution to widen the gap between himself and his pursuers, securing his advantage.

The three Golden Core ancestors of Fire Persimmon Immortal City were Zhu Xuanji's helpers.

The three families had a two-pronged approach.

The first path was to rely on Zhu Xuanji, expressing loyalty and depending on the royal family.

The second path was to cultivate their own reformation teams, continuously breaking through the Lava Immortal Palace's checkpoints.

Cultivation families operate this way, never putting all their eggs in one basket.

Therefore, true cultivation families have high-level cultivators serving in different countries, even in rival nations.

Bang!

Ning Xiaoren slammed his hand on the table in anger, growling, "He really did it?!" "Good, good."

"I thought it was the Zhou family and the Zheng family who figured out the setup and obtained the trial disciple insignia." "I didn't expect it to be Ning Zhuo!"

"For a mere thousand spirit stones, he sold such crucial information to Zheng Jian and Zhou Zeshen!" "Does he not know that our Ning family could use this opportunity to gain an advantage and close the gap with the Zhou and Zheng families?" "He put his own interests above the family's big picture!" "Ning Zhuo is too short-sighted, too narrow-minded, too selfish."

"Just because we didn't agree to give him Ice Jade Wine, he immediately sold the information to outsiders." "Traitor!"

"Is he still a member of the Ning family? What did he learn in all those years of schooling?!" "It seems we must teach him a lesson, let him know how badly he has erred."

Ning Xiaoren paced back and forth in the study, then ordered the freezing of resources allocated to Ning Zhuo in the reformation team.

But then he remembered that Ning Zhuo's cultivation resources were not limited to this; he had many other sources of income, quite substantial.

Ning Xiaoren thought of Ning Xiaohui, who gathered main branch members but only reached the second room, while Ning Zhuo had consecutively broken through to the eighth room.

"Ning Xiaohui is not up to the task."

"If she could suppress Ning Zhuo, would he still be so ambitious?!" Ning Xiaoren paced again, then issued a second order.

Ning Zhuo had joined the reformation team, giving Ning Xiaoren the right to command him.

"You are so focused on studying mechanical constructs?"

"Very well, Ning Zhuo."

"Now, you won't have half an hour to spare for your research."

Ning Xiaoren sneered inwardly.

Ning Zhuo refused the order.

Ning Zhuo withdrew from the reformation team.

"What?!" Ning Xiaoren was stunned when he heard this.

When he recovered, his heart was filled with rage.

"Audacious, audacious!" "How dare he, how dare he!"

"How dare he refuse the family's assignment, how dare he unilaterally withdraw from the reformation team?!" "Ahhhh!"

Ning Xiaoren was furious, smashing the inkstone on the table to the ground.

After smashing it, he felt something was missing.

So, he went to the private prison and saw Ning Ze.

"You raised a good nephew!" Ning Xiaoren raised a long whip and continuously lashed Ning Ze to vent his anger.

Ning Ze: "Ah—!"</div>
