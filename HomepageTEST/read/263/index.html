<div id="chapterContent">Chapter 263: I Am a Thief

Ning Zhuo licked his lips, his breath slightly quickening as he glanced at Zhu Xuanji, a hint of urgency in his gaze. "Lord Zhu, you hail from the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family, while I am a branch of the Ning family. My mother passed away when I was very young. My father left even earlier; I have never seen him. Even though I have an elder uncle, I am not close to him and have not received much care from him. My life has been difficult from childhood to adulthood."

"You claim to observe and ensure the safety of the people, but you are merely a bystander. You have never experienced it yourself; you do not know that many times, I am not considering the righteous path or the wrong path, but rather where I can find my next meal. Those at the bottom can only focus on the present."

"Many times, it is not a matter of choice for them; it is that they have no choice at all! Righteous path, wrong path? Heh, in their eyes, there may only ever be one road: the road to survival!" Ning Zhuo did not directly respond but effectively answered Zhu Xuanji's words.

He lacked key information, so he could not question how Zhu Xuanji had come to suspect him.

It was akin to confessing without being asked! He did not test the waters or remain silent, as either could provoke Zhu Xuanji's dislike or anger.

Ning Zhuo chose to play a passive defense, countering as needed.

He deliberately spoke of his hardships to exploit Zhu Xuanji's temperament.

At the Fire Persimmon Festival, Zhu Xuanji's appearance had caught Ning Zhuo off guard, forcing him to take risks and gamble, leading to a narrow escape from disaster.

Afterward, Ning Zhuo reflected on his mistake—he had been too lacking in intelligence regarding Zhu Xuanji.

From that point on, he dedicated himself to gathering relevant information.

One learns from mistakes.

He would not make the same error again, for repeating it could mean the difference between life and death.

There is a saying that rings true—the ones who know you best are often your enemies!

Zhu Xuanji remained expressionless, but inwardly he sighed deeply.

He was moved! There are only wrong names, not wrong titles.

He claimed to observe and ensure the safety of the people because, deep down, he harbored compassion for the lower classes and the weak.

Ning Zhuo's words struck a soft spot in his heart.

Of course, he could tell that Ning Zhuo's mention of suffering and being forced into circumstances also carried an undertone of seeking understanding and testing Zhu Xuanji.

Zhu Xuanji felt a sense of comfort.

At least Ning Zhuo was speaking the truth and attempting to seek Zhu Xuanji's understanding, rather than outright denying or refuting.

How should one put it? Speaking with an intelligent person is a relief! Ning Zhuo's awareness of the situation further convinced Zhu Xuanji that this young man before him still had hope and could be won over.

Zhu Xuanji sighed softly, "Paths are forged by people walking them! Some paths are easy but wrong, while others are difficult yet correct. Just like Li Leifeng, who lived a hard and frugal life in his later years, yet because of this, he is so highly respected. In truth, everyone has a scale that constantly measures others and situations. Those who bear burdens and warm others are the ones who emit light. You have also been illuminated by this light! Li Leifeng has long pointed the way for you."

Ning Zhuo fell silent.

The strategy of showing weakness and empathy was effective.

From Zhu Xuanji's tone, expression, and words, he did not detect any disgust or disdain.

Yet the problem still existed.

Ning Zhuo did not know what clues Zhu Xuanji had grasped that led him to suspect and draw him in.

This was crucial; without knowing this, Ning Zhuo could only passively defend himself in this exchange, unable to take the initiative!

"This cannot continue," he thought. "In the end, I will be cornered with no room to maneuver. Rather than that, I might as well take some risks now."

Ning Zhuo had already foreseen his defeat and gritted his teeth, deciding to take a gamble.

He spoke, "Li Leifeng is a model of righteousness; every time I think of him, I feel warmth. He makes me feel that this world is worth it. However, how many Li Leifengs are there in this world? How many people can bask in his light?"

"Yes, I have been cared for. I am fortunate, but I am also unfortunate. It is precisely because I have felt warmth that I understand the pain of coldness more deeply."

Pausing, Ning Zhuo looked at Zhu Xuanji, his eyes full of spirit. "Lord Zhu, people are different from one another. To me, Li Leifeng and you are both high above, figures on the stage. Whether genuine or feigned, it is all glamorous. Yet I am ultimately one below the stage."

"Do you know what it feels like to sneak a bite of leftover pastries from those guests? You have to harden your heart and endure the disdainful and contemptuous gazes. You have to reach out and pick through the refuse of cups and plates. You will feel shame; this feeling is told to you by outsiders, but it also comes from deep within, succumbing to the cravings of the stomach. I am from the bottom; I have always been."

"Though my surname is Ning, I never feel noble. I am despicable. I am a thief! I am someone who rummages through garbage to find food. I am from the bottom. Heh, perhaps saying this is a bit pretentious. But I truly believe this!"

"Look, even as I grew up, I still meddled in the black market. I scavenge from places looked down upon by the righteous. I am not afraid of winning; I only fear not being full." Ning Zhuo exhaled a breath of turbid air, a sorrowful smile on his face.

"I know there are people like Li Leifeng in this world. I admire him and am grateful. And you, Lord Zhu. I admire you. This is the truth!"

"You are of the royal family, a divine constable, yet you have your own principles and always adhere to them. You are a gentleman, and you deserve your reputation."

"However, I deeply understand that people are different from one another, starting from their origins. The paths of people are also different. No one can truly help me. People are lonely; one cannot fully understand another. Most of the time, I can only rely on myself. The path I walk is my own choice!"

Zhu Xuanji fell into silence.

His heart felt heavy.

Ning Zhuo's words stirred emotions within him.

He understood many of Ning Zhuo's circumstances; although he focused on the Ning family's identity, he had not benefited much from it since childhood.

Zhu Xuanji felt pity! He was like a drowning person, shouting for help, reaching out to be saved.

Yet this drowning person wished to sink.

Thus, Zhu Xuanji felt powerless, sorrowful, indignant, and frustrated! A young man like you, with such talent and potential, should not be so willing to fall!

Zhu Xuanji's gaze turned cold as he actively shifted the topic, "Ning Zhuo, you have seen the play 'Seeking Justice,' right?"

Ning Zhuo replied, "I have seen it many times."

Zhu Xuanji continued, "You are correct. The empathy between people is often just watching from the sidelines. At such times, we need to take action ourselves to try to feel."

"Li Leifeng has performed 'Seeking Justice' for you many times. You always stood below the stage, thinking you were still that little thief sneaking bites. Not anymore! As of today, you are no longer the same."

"You are now a person on stage. Do you know that Li Leifeng also looks forward to you standing on stage? He once believed that you would shine from the age of six and gradually take the stage."

Ning Zhuo's heart stirred slightly.

Zhu Xuanji continued, "Li Leifeng has passed away; he did not see you shine in his lifetime, which is one of his regrets. Go and make up for this regret. Perform a play of 'Seeking Justice.'"

"Try to stand in Li Leifeng's shoes and perform a puppet show, experiencing the situation and feelings he faced." Ning Zhuo hesitated, "This..."

Zhu Xuanji's gaze deepened, "Don't tell me you lack the skill to control the puppets."

Ning Zhuo shook his head, "Of course not..."

Zhu Xuanji asserted strongly, interrupting, "You may not realize, but he has given you many opportunities. I am also giving you an opportunity now. You should give yourself a chance. Go on stage."

"Although Li Leifeng has passed away, I believe he still leaves light for you, to guide you onto the righteous path!" At this point, Ning Zhuo had already guessed that the flaw likely originated from Li Leifeng.

However, with the confrontation between him and Zhu Xuanji reaching this level, he was already cornered and had no way to refuse; he could only comply.

Receiving Zhu Xuanji's telepathic message, Zhu Hou immediately made arrangements.

The elder in charge took the stage to inform everyone that although donations had ended, a young genius was willing to perform a puppet show to entertain everyone.

Thus, Ning Zhuo stepped onto the stage.

He bowed to the cultivators below and in the building, "Respected seniors, please allow me to present my humble offering. When I was young, my family was poor, and life was difficult. I was fortunate to receive care from Lord Li Leifeng on many occasions. He never asked for anything in return, only wishing to help others. His character and virtue are truly admirable."

"I have watched the elder's puppet shows countless times; they are extraordinarily wonderful. Now, I am fortunate to have learned some of the skills. Today, I present this puppet show in memory of Lord Li Leifeng and to celebrate Lord Zhu's succession." The sounds of drums and cheers erupted.

The cultivators felt surprised and delighted, and the atmosphere in the building grew warm.

Before the golden core chaos, Ning Zhuo's reputation had only spread within a small circle among the four major forces.

The Ning family was familiar with him, as he had pulled Ning Xiaohui down from power.

After the golden core chaos, due to rumors and other factors, Ning Zhuo became widely known.

This time, Zhu Xuanji brought him to participate in this ceremony, leaving a deep impression on everyone.

Almost everyone speculated that Ning Zhuo had caught Zhu Xuanji's eye and was now riding on his coattails.

Because of Zhu Xuanji, Ning Zhuo was given even more attention.

Now, this rising star of the righteous path personally took the stage to perform a puppet show, drawing great interest from the crowd.

Regardless of how the performance went, many had already formed the thought in their hearts—after the show, they would add to their donations.

After all, supporting Ning Zhuo meant supporting Zhu Xuanji!

Those of the righteous path were quite aware of the situation.</div>
