<div id="chapterContent">Chapter 163: Great Rewards for Ning Zhuo

Ning Ze's Residence.

After breakfast, Ning Zhuo arrived in the courtyard.

Ning Chen, Ning Yong, and others were already there.

When the classmates saw Ning Zhuo, they all stood up and saluted.

Ning Yong, with dark circles under his eyes, joyfully exclaimed, "Brother Zhuo, I couldn't sleep at all last night! Too excited, hahaha." Others echoed, laughing along.

Ning Zhuo cupped his hands in thanks once more, exchanged a few pleasantries, and then said to the person behind him, "Cousin, just find a place to sit." "Today, we will continue to discuss our experiences in spellcasting. Although you haven't practiced the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique, listening more can still be beneficial." Ning Ji, looking embarrassed, nodded repeatedly, "Alright, alright. I'll follow your arrangements!"

His father, Ning Ze, had called him into the study early in the morning and sternly instructed him to fully rely on Ning Zhuo.

Ning Ji dared not disobey his father's orders, so during breakfast, he "proactively" requested to follow Ning Zhuo, even expressing a desire to leave the Talisman Hall.

Ning Zhuo did not directly accept his request but suggested that Ning Ji stay in the Talisman Hall while also participating in their discussions and exchanges on spellcasting.

Ning Zhuo's response did not completely satisfy Ning Ze, but it did not entirely disappoint him either.

Ning Ji mingled with the crowd, greeting others briefly.

He was originally a classmate of Ning Zhuo, and the members of the reformation team were all familiar faces.

Ning Ji intended to sit closest to Ning Zhuo, but at that moment, Ning Chen suddenly spoke up, "That's my seat. What are you doing?"

Ning Ji exclaimed, "Isn't it free seating?"

Ning Chen sneered, "Seats have their own rules. At the very least, you should understand the principle of first come, first served. You arrived last, so you should sit at the back."

Ning Ji retorted, "You, Ning Chen! How arrogant. Don't forget, this courtyard belongs to my family. I'm the host, and you're the guest. How can a guest bully the host?"

Ning Chen laughed heartily, pointing at Ning Ji, "Do you think we care about this shabby courtyard? We're here because Brother Zhuo is staying here. Believe it or not, if Brother Zhuo moves to any other courtyard, we'll follow him there?"

Unable to out-argue Ning Chen, Ning Ji turned to Ning Zhuo, "Cousin, look at this..."

Ning Zhuo smiled slightly, "Today, we are discussing spells, exchanging and learning from each other, just like in a school." "In school, we don't talk about cousins; we're all classmates." "Ning Ji, you can sit at the back. It won't affect your learning."

Ning Ji's face turned a bit red with embarrassment and anger, and he gritted his teeth, "Since my father told me to follow you, I'll listen to you." Ning Ji sat at the outermost, farthest place from the group.

Closest to Ning Zhuo were still Ning Chen and Ning Yong.

Seeing this scene, everyone had their own thoughts.

"The day before yesterday, we discussed the Embrace Ice Technique. Today, I want to talk about the combination of the Embrace Ice Technique and the Qi Breath Technique." "If there's anything I miss or get wrong, please feel free to correct me." Ning Zhuo began his lecture.

Everyone listened attentively.

Initially, many of them didn't care, thinking Ning Zhuo was just lucky to find a technique that suited him, the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique.

But after Ning Zhuo actively shared his spellcasting experiences, they all changed their minds, recognizing that Ning Zhuo was indeed a talented individual with extraordinary insights into spells.

Ning Zhuo humbly called it an exchange and discussion, but Ning Chen, Ning Yong, and others knew well that Ning Zhuo was imparting his precious spellcasting experiences to them!

Ning Zhuo, who had early wisdom, benefited from his mother's will and Sun Lingtong's education, always hid his strength in school.

Later, through the rewards from the Lava Immortal Palace's ranking, his spellcasting experience skyrocketed, making him more than capable of guiding these classmates.

Among the crowd, the least attentive was Ning Ji.

Ning Ji felt indignant, thinking that his first time following Ning Zhuo had resulted in unfair treatment.

"I'm your cousin, yet you help outsiders instead of me!" "What are you even talking about?" "I haven't even learned the Embrace Ice Technique or the Qi Breath Technique!"

Ning Zhuo sensed Ning Ji's resentment, but the latter was not focused on the exchange and learning.

Ning Zhuo did not point it out, letting Ning Ji stew in his emotions.

It wasn't until the family envoy arrived that Ning Zhuo interrupted the exchange.

The envoy said, "Ning Zhuo, the former young clan leader Ning Xiaoren has been imprisoned. I bring you your deserved rewards." "A Tornado Windmill Magical Artifact, a bottle of Three Apertures Exquisite Heart Pills, three bottles of Condensing Qi Pills, a bottle of Marrow Cleansing Pills, and a bottle of Detoxification Pills." The envoy recited the list and handed the storage bag to Ning Zhuo.

"Please check and confirm."

Ning Zhuo opened the storage bag, checked it, and nodded slightly, asking, "There's no Enlightenment Diagram or Ice King Wine. May I ask why?" "Yes, Brother Zhuo reached the eighth level. He was still in the reformation team at the time, and according to the rules, he should have received the opportunity to comprehend the Enlightenment Diagram and the Ice Jade Wine!" Ning Yong was the first to speak.

Other classmates also spoke up, supporting him.

The envoy's face changed slightly, and he quickly waved his hand, "Everyone, please calm down. I'm just the first wave." "Since yesterday, the family elders have been discussing giving Ning Zhuo more compensation." "These rewards are just part of it, the ones that could be prepared first and sent by me." "There will be other envoys after me." Hearing this, everyone calmed down.

"I see, I misunderstood the envoy." Ning Zhuo smiled, inviting the envoy to rest inside.

The envoy declined, leaving after the handover.

Ning Zhuo tied the storage bag to his waist and continued to impart spellcasting experiences and techniques.

About half an hour later, the second envoy arrived.

"A Five Elements Ruler Magical Artifact, a Calm Heart Bell Magical Artifact, a bottle of Enlightenment Pills, a stack of Qi Boosting Talismans, and six Harmony Talismans." The envoy announced.

Ning Zhuo checked the storage bag, confirming the contents.

He couldn't help but feel something.

The envoy, seeing Ning Zhuo not asking questions, took the initiative to explain, "Brother Ning Zhuo, are you anxious? The Ice Jade Wine will be delivered. However, this type of wine needs to be stored in an Ice Heart Jade Pot to maintain its quality. And the Ice Heart Jade Pot is a treasured item of our clan, always with the ancestor."

"Therefore, to get a portion of the wine, one must meet the ancestor, who will personally bestow it, and then the clan leader will pass it on." Ning Zhuo smiled, "I'm not in a hurry. Envoy, you must be tired. Why not rest inside?" The envoy waved his hand, "No, no, I have other matters to attend to."

Ning Zhuo said, "It's too much trouble for the envoy to deliver multiple times. Why not let the main branch prepare everything and notify me? I'll go and collect it all at once." The second envoy shook his head slightly, "I just follow orders." Ning Zhuo didn't let it go easily, "Then please convey my thoughts to them." "Alright." The second envoy also left.

Ning Zhuo walked back from the courtyard gate, hearing his classmates excitedly discussing.

"Didn't expect the family elders to be so generous this time!"

"These are all good things. Even Ning Xiaohui never received such treatment."

"This is because Brother Zhuo gave them a profound lesson, making the elders understand what to do!"

"Hahaha, indeed! Even the young clan leader was brought down by Brother Zhuo. Who dares to mistreat Brother Zhuo now? Afraid of being brought down too?"

Ning Yong muttered, "Why is delivering rewards so troublesome? Back and forth, why not send everything at once?"

Ning Chen squinted his eyes, "Perhaps someone among the family elders wants to show everyone that they are not mistreating Brother Zhuo anymore."

Since Ning Yong started calling Ning Zhuo "Brother Zhuo," the nickname gradually spread.

Especially after yesterday's events, all classmates changed their address, only calling him "Brother Zhuo," and no one called Ning Zhuo by his name anymore.

On the third visit, the envoy finally brought the Ice Jade Wine.

"Two taels of Ice Jade Wine, a Profound Ice Waist Token, two Enlightenment Diagrams of Ling Frost and Proud Snow, three stacks of Ice Light Strong Vein Talismans, a bottle of White Snow Spring Pills, and ten top-grade spirit stones!"

After announcing, the envoy reminded Ning Zhuo that the Ice Jade Wine couldn't be stored for long and needed to be consumed quickly.

The Ling Frost and Proud Snow diagrams were masterpieces containing profound principles, not Ning Zhuo's property, and were only lent to him temporarily.

After the time limit, Ning Zhuo must return them to the family treasury.

The envoy was about to leave when Ning Zhuo stopped him, frowning, "These rewards are many, far exceeding what I deserve. I cannot accept them all without merit. I will only take what I should, and the rest should be returned to the family treasury."

The envoy was prepared and replied, "These are not just rewards but also compensation from the elders."

"Ning Xiaoren, as the young clan leader, was indeed unqualified. Brother Ning Zhuo, your achievements in exploring the Immortal Palace are significant. These are to appease you."

"The higher-ups mean it this way."

"Once these things are given to you, they are yours. How you use them is up to you."

"Farewell."

The envoy left.

Ning Ji finally couldn't hold back, standing up and calling out, "Cousin, you have so many cultivation resources. How can you use them all by yourself?" "Look, I helped in the ancestral hall yesterday too."

"Why not lend me those two Enlightenment Diagrams, or the Tornado Windmill, or even the Calm Heart Bell?"

Ning Zhuo quickly glanced at the others, noticing that many of them were also tempted.

The family elders had given too much, and these classmates, being sixteen or seventeen years old, had never seen such generosity.

Ning Ji voiced what many were thinking.

"You see."

"Yesterday, we all helped, creating a sensation that shook the entire clan, bringing down Ning Xiaoren and giving you such rich rewards." "Other pills are consumables, and we wouldn't feel right asking for them." "But these Magical Artifacts are excellent for assisting in cultivation. With our relationship, lending them should be fine, right?"

Under the hopeful gazes of everyone, Ning Zhuo's faint smile disappeared.

He shook his head expressionlessly, "Cultivation treasures are personal items and cannot be lent out casually. Don't bring this up again!" "Alright, the family's rewards are finally distributed." "Let's continue."

Ning Zhuo returned to his original position and resumed teaching spellcasting techniques and insights.

"Stingy, so stingy!" Ning Ji, directly and ruthlessly rejected by Ning Zhuo, was further agitated by the rich rewards, and his jealousy quickly turned to resentment.

Some classmates also felt uneasy.

But most quickly adjusted their mindset, focusing on the lecture.

Ning Zhuo, without showing any emotion, silently noted everyone's reactions.</div>
