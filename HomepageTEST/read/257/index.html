<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Upon receiving Fei Si's plea for help, Zhu Xuanji prioritized the greater good and immediately departed from the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
When cultivators enter the Lava Immortal Palace, they are guided by a treasure light, but upon leaving, they receive no such courtesy.<br/>
<br/>
However, You Zhui could not stand idly by.<br/>
<br/>
After disrupting the formation of the demon beasts, Zhu Xuanji managed to escape and soared into the sky.<br/>
<br/>
Moments later, he arrived at Cloud City and met with Song Fuli and Fei Si.<br/>
<br/>
Song Fuli clasped his hands, his face filled with anticipation and urgency: "Lord Zhu Xuanji, I've long admired your great name! The auction is imminent, yet our auction items have all been stolen."<br/>
<br/>
"I traveled from afar, not expecting to encounter thieves in Fire Persimmon Immortal City. Now, I can only rely on your strength."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji nodded, "Rest assured, I will do my utmost in this matter."<br/>
<br/>
Upon arriving at the scene, Zhu Xuanji wasted no time and immediately employed his signature technique.<br/>
<br/>
Tracing Origin Technique!<br/>
<br/>
Innate Talentâ€”Heaven-Piercing Eyes!<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, he saw Yang Chanyu and Sun Lingtong conspiring, forging goods and placing them on the shelves.<br/>
<br/>
The truth was instantly revealed!<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji sighed, withdrew his technique, and gave Song Fuli a deep look.<br/>
<br/>
Song Fuli, full of urgency, asked, "Lord Zhu, what did you find?" Fei Si also watched Zhu Xuanji intently.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji nodded slightly, "I found out... it was Yang Chanyu and Sun Lingtong who did it."<br/>
<br/>
"Even though the two concealed themselves, they couldn't escape my Heaven-Piercing Eyes. With a thorough investigation, I uncovered the truth." "Void Sect!" Fei Si gritted his teeth, speaking with hatred.<br/>
<br/>
"Void Sect..." Song Fuli also clenched his fists, showing anger.<br/>
<br/>
He looked at Zhu Xuanji and Fei Si, "The key now is how to retrieve my treasures from them." "Lord Fei Si, I remember when we first entered the city, I saw the ruins of a Golden Core battle. How did you respond to me then?" "You said there was no problem, that Fire Persimmon Immortal City was quite safe, and the City Lord's Mansion had control over the situation." "But now, look!"<br/>
<br/>
"Evil is rampant in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, and my goods were stolen so easily."<br/>
<br/>
"What do you have to say about this? The City Lord's Mansion must give me, the victim, an explanation, right?" "We Cloud Merchants have traveled a long way, braving countless risks, to conduct some hard-earned business. Is it easy?"<br/>
<br/>
"I didn't expect to be robbed in the Immortal City instead of on the road!"<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si's face showed embarrassment, and he forced a smile, trying to reassure, "Brother Song, rest assured. We will do our utmost to track down and retrieve your goods." Song Fuli spread his hands, "The auction is in two days. Can you retrieve them in such a short time?" "Moreover, the auction news has already been released." "If it can't be held, what will happen to our Cloud Merchants' reputation?" "Oh dear!"<br/>
<br/>
Song Fuli was so anxious that he slapped his thigh, truly showing signs of distress.<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si's face was full of seriousness.<br/>
<br/>
He also knew that retrieving the goods from the true disciples of the Void Sect in such a short time was extremely difficult and the hope was slim.<br/>
<br/>
But this matter had to be handled, and it had to be handled very well!<br/>
<br/>
He took a deep breath and immediately stated, "I will immediately visit Lord Meng Kui and report this matter, asking the City Lord to make a decision!" Before leaving, Fei Si glanced at Zhu Xuanji, entrusting him to continue the investigation.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji nodded, immediately agreeing, but also stated that he could only do his best and could not guarantee any results within two days.<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si sighed, clasped his hands, and took his leave.<br/>
<br/>
He transformed into a long rainbow and flew straight to the top of Fire Persimmon Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji, however, stayed behind, giving Song Fuli a gentle smile, "Brother Song, there's something quite interesting I want to let you know." "According to my recent investigation, when Yang Chanyu and Sun Lingtong stole the treasures, they were not here but inside the Cloud Whale." Song Fuli raised his eyebrows immediately, "What do you mean by this?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji, with his hands behind his back, looked out the window at the Cloud Whale floating in the sky, "Your caravan's treasures being stolen inside the Cloud Whale and being stolen in Fire Persimmon Immortal City are two different things." "The responsibility for the former mainly lies with your side. If you want to hold someone accountable for the latter, the City Lord's Mansion of Fire Persimmon Immortal City is the main party." "Do you agree?"<br/>
<br/>
Song Fuli took a deep breath and chuckled, "Lord Zhu, don't speak carelessly. If you accuse us of falsifying, concealing, and pretending that the treasures were stolen in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, you must have solid evidence." "Even though you are a Divine Constable, you are from the Southern Bean Kingdom, and your allegiance lies with Fire Persimmon Immortal City. Therefore, your testimony cannot be considered evidence."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji snorted coldly, turned to stare at Song Fuli, his gaze becoming extremely sharp, "You also know that I am a member of the royal family. Even if I don't have evidence, so what? Can I not deal with you?"<br/>
<br/>
Song Fuli took a step back, as if avoiding Zhu Xuanji's sharpness, his tone soft yet firm, "Within the Southern Bean Kingdom, you are the host, and we are the guests. If you want to deal with us outsiders, it would be easy for you." "If you really want to take action against us, we can only accept it." "However, how could the esteemed Lord Zhu Xuanji do such a thing?"<br/>
<br/>
"The renowned Divine Constable Zhu, who has always advocated for seeking justice, is the Golden Core emblem of the Southern Bean Kingdom. How could he act against someone merely suspected without evidence?" "I, Song Fuli, do not believe it!"<br/>
<br/>
Song Fuli's expression was firm, his tone resolute.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, the exchange between the two Golden Core cultivators was more intense than a battle of blades!<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji couldn't help but raise his eyebrows.<br/>
<br/>
He stared closely at Song Fuli, his sharp aura retracted, and his tone softened, "You have investigated my situation quite thoroughly, even knowing my usual advocacy for seeking justice." "It seems your side also wants a share in the Lava Immortal Palace, doesn't it?"<br/>
<br/>
Since it had come to this point, Song Fuli saw no reason to hide anymore.<br/>
<br/>
He simply admitted, "Yes, after hearing about the recruitment decree issued by your country's king, we set out for this place." "As Cloud Merchants, we don't act without profit."<br/>
<br/>
"We have carefully studied the recruitment decree and thoughtfully considered it. We believe we are qualified, aren't we?"<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji chuckled lightly, nodding, "Of course, you are qualified! As a member of the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family, I welcome this and look forward to our cooperation."<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Zhu Xuanji smile, Song Fuli also smiled, greatly easing the atmosphere in the room.<br/>
<br/>
He said in a deep voice, "I have felt Lord Zhu's sincerity!"<br/>
<br/>
Song Fuli was referring to the fact that Zhu Xuanji had clearly discovered the truth, that Yang and Sun had stolen the treasures inside the Cloud Whale, but he did not reveal it, instead choosing to conceal it for the Cloud Merchants.<br/>
<br/>
As a royal family member, Zhu Xuanji had to consider the Zhu family.<br/>
<br/>
His intention to conceal was obvious, to win over Song Fuli and his group.<br/>
<br/>
After all, in the struggle for the Lava Immortal Palace, Zhu Xuanji would ultimately face Meng Kui.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji was at the Golden Core Stage, while Meng Kui was at the Nascent Soul Stage, a significant difference in cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, Zhu Xuanji wanted to form alliances, trying to win over Song Fuli's group, who possessed the Cloud Whale, to slightly counterbalance Meng Kui.<br/>
<br/>
The development of the situation to this point was something Fei Si had not anticipated.<br/>
<br/>
He flew to the top of Fire Persimmon Mountain to meet Meng Kui.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui gazed at the Cloud Whale on the horizon, remained silent for a while, then nodded slightly.<br/>
<br/>
He authorized Fei Si to negotiate well with the Cloud Merchants and allowed him to concede some benefits.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui, considering his political achievements, chose the lesser of two evils and decided to ally with the Cloud Merchants.<br/>
<br/>
"Unexpectedly, I, an old man, am constrained by a spirit!"<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui's gaze pierced through layers of clouds, overlooking the entire Lava Immortal Palace, containing hidden anger.<br/>
<br/>
In his view, the bombardment of Fire Persimmon Mountain by the Five Elements Tower was the work of the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit.<br/>
<br/>
Even if a cultivator cooperated, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, as the palace spirit, could not be bypassed and was at least a major accomplice!<br/>
<br/>
"In the future, when my Meng family controls the Immortal Palace, I will certainly discipline this Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit!" "But for now, the urgent task is to secretly contact this palace spirit and feign cooperation."<br/>
<br/>
During this time, Meng Kui had repeatedly tried to contact the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, but had not succeeded, making little progress.<br/>
<br/>
"Zhu Xuanji should know some secrets. The Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family has close ties with the Three Sects, but probing him on this matter requires utmost caution." Meng Kui's gaze was deep, "Zhu Xuanji is perceptive. If he realizes the palace spirit has ulterior motives, it will be much more troublesome."<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui temporarily concealed the palace spirit's secret, as he saw Zhu Xuanji, representing the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family, as his main competitor.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji, on the other hand, secretly reached a verbal agreement with Song Fuli to join forces, attempting to unite the weak against the strong.<br/>
<br/>
Song Fuli, leveraging the competition between the royal family and local forces, sought to recover the stolen treasures and had a great chance of success.<br/>
<br/>
The open and covert struggles among the three parties greatly consumed their energy and time, giving Ning Zhuo's side a chance to breathe.<br/>
<br/>
Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit suppressed its excitement and once again contacted Ning Zhuo: "Young Master, good news, Zhu Xuanji has left, he has left the Immortal Palace." "It's time for us to act and eliminate Ning Xiaohui!"<br/>
<br/>
Yang Chanyu also confirmed Zhu Xuanji's movements.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong infiltrated Ning Zhuo's side and transmitted a message to him: "The enemy, I've identified them!"<br/>
<br/>
"That Song Fuli is also a cunning merchant! He must have discovered the theft early on but kept quiet, moved the fake goods to the Immortal City, and then fabricated the crime scene to claim compensation from the City Lord's Mansion." "The rumors about the stolen goods have spread throughout the Immortal City, likely orchestrated by Song Fuli to exonerate himself and pressure the City Lord's Mansion." "Zhu Xuanji left the Immortal Palace this time to investigate this major theft case." "Now that he's not in the Immortal Palace, it's indeed a good time to act."<br/>
<br/>
"I'll take action, with Yang Chanyu secretly guarding, to eliminate Ning Xiaohui and remove this major threat!" Sun Lingtong was eager to move.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, however, frowned deeply, pacing back and forth in the room several times.<br/>
<br/>
"No, let's wait a bit longer." Ning Zhuo hesitated and struggled, but ultimately held Sun Lingtong back for the time being.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong was puzzled, but a decade of tacit understanding made him realize that Ning Zhuo must have his reasons for making such a choice.<br/>
<br/>
"Alright, I'll follow closely behind her, waiting for your notification at any time." "Use the Life-Hanging Thread to contact me!"<br/>
<br/>
"Just say the word, and I'll act immediately." Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo reached an agreement.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit waited and waited, but neither Ning Zhuo nor Sun Lingtong made a move.<br/>
<br/>
It was so anxious that it stomped on its throne.<br/>
<br/>
It kept growling, "Ning Zhuo, Ning Zhuo! What are you waiting for, what are you hesitating about?!" "Act, act quickly!!"<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Xiaohui is about to gain a position, oh! Truly, a fool cannot be plotted with!" Roar, roar...<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was so anxious that it spewed a pillar of fire into the air.</div>
