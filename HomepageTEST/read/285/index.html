<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
A woman with a delicate face, tinged with a layer of bluish-gray, hid in the shadows of a narrow alley. It was Han Ming.<br/>
<br/>
The roars of demonic beasts suddenly echoed from afar. Han Ming looked up and saw a group of Red Rock Demons flying over Fire Persimmon Immortal City. Immediately, the city guards noticed the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...<br/>
<br/>
A series of spells shot into the sky, exploding like fireworks in a myriad of colors. Many Red Rock Demons fell as a result, and a small crisis was smoothly resolved.<br/>
<br/>
Han Ming withdrew her gaze, looking straight ahead at the City Lord's Mansion across the street. <br/>
<br/>
"I am already caught in this massive whirlpool of conflict," Han Ming sighed deeply, her face full of bitterness. Had she known it would come to this, she would have chosen to flee far away, leaving Fire Persimmon Immortal City behind entirely.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, she was unwilling to admit defeat or give up. She hadn't participated in the battle of Qi Bai. She had been manipulated by Ning Zhuo. And, after realizing she had been tricked, hid herself, narrowly escaping disaster.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps this experience fueled her sense of luck, allowing her to remain hidden in the Immortal City until now -- when she was ultimately captured by Luo Shang and used as a pawn.<br/>
<br/>
"Luo Shang didn't plant any restrictions on me. Perhaps I can simply escape?" <br/>
<br/>
This thought had only just arisen before Han Ming immediately buried it. It was precisely because Luo Shang didn't plant restrictions that Han Ming was extremely wary. She had already guessed that this was likely a test from Luo Shang. If she tried to escape, Luo Shang would surely capture her again, and by then her treatment would not be as it was now.<br/>
<br/>
"Luo Shang is different from Qi Bai." <br/>
<br/>
"Qi Bai came from humble beginnings, while Luo Shang had the backing of sect elders. Luo Shang's foundation is far more profound than Qi Bai's." <br/>
<br/>
"Not to mention, Luo Shang came here on an important mission from his sect, receiving substantial support." <br/>
<br/>
"Golden Core-level Ghost Generals -- Qi Bai has none, but Luo Shang has many." <br/>
<br/>
"Could it be that right now, there's a Golden Core-level Ghost General watching over me?" Han Ming couldn't be sure.<br/>
<br/>
She was a peak Foundation Establishment demon cultivator and with her own means alone, it was quite difficult to detect whether there were Golden Core-level Ghost Generals around her. <br/>
<br/>
Though her means were lacking, she possessed the wisdom of a demon cultivator and used it to survive. Based on her deductions, she knew that if she acted according to Luo Shang's arrangements, there might still be hope. If she truly tried to flee, the outcome would surely be tragic!<br/>
<br/>
Since the night of the bombardment, the City Lord's Mansion had been brightly lit. At present, the brightly lit mansion seemed like a beast with its bloody maw wide open, ready to devour people. <br/>
<br/>
Han Ming steeled herself. She stepped out of the shadows and walked slowly towards the City Lord's Mansion.<br/>
<br/>
She had just appeared when she was spotted by the city guards. <br/>
<br/>
"Who goes there?" <br/>
<br/>
"Halt!" <br/>
<br/>
Han Ming shouted, "I am Han Ming, a wanted criminal of Fire Persimmon Immortal City. I have come to surrender and report a crime!" <br/>
<br/>
The guards exchanged suspicious glances, not daring to make a decision on their own. Someone immediately ran back to the City Lord's Mansion to report to Fei Si.<br/>
<br/>
"What? Han Ming suddenly appeared and voluntarily surrendered?" Fei Si heard the news, but his face showed no joy. At the critical moment of the demonic beast siege, he didn't want any unexpected incidents. However, Han Ming's appearance was not something he could control.<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si, with his keen intuition, immediately understood that Han Ming's strange actions must have been instructed. "She is a member of the Soul Devouring Sect, backed by a super sect of the demonic path. This time, might she be acting under Luo Shang's orders?" The more Fei Si thought about it, the more severe his expression became.<br/>
<br/>
"Bring her in!" Fei Si decisively decided to personally interrogate her. At the same time, he urgently sent a flying message and dispatched a messenger to invite Chi Dun to assist.<br/>
<br/>
Given the current situation, Fei Si was extremely cautious, fearing that the Soul Devouring Sect might target the City Lord's Mansion or himself. After all, the opponent was a major sect of the demonic path.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, Fei Si arrived at the court and saw Han Ming, who was bound. Fei Si struck the gavel and sternly questioned her.<br/>
<br/>
Despite her inner anxiety, Han Ming maintained a smile, showing neither arrogance nor servility even in the face of pressure from a Golden Core cultivator, even appearing quite confident. <br/>
<br/>
She slowly recounted how she was plotted against, abused by Chui Tiao Ke, and witnessed Yuan Dasheng's corpse, telling everything to Fei Si.<br/>
<br/>
"Take Han Ming to the dungeon!" Fei Si ordered sternly. Han Ming continued to smile, actively cooperating. Her demeanor made Fei Si's face darken like water.<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si, well-versed in politics and having seen many schemes, immediately realized that there was extreme malicious intent; this was the Soul Devouring Sect's attempt to sow discord between Meng Kui and Zhu Xuanji. Although he knew it was the enemy's scheme, he dared not act on his own.<br/>
<br/>
He wrote a letter on the spot, dispatching a messenger to urgently convey this intelligence to Meng Kui. Due to the demonic beast tide ravaging Fire Persimmon Mountain, the usual flying messages couldn't reach Meng Kui. Therefore, the messenger, a skilled swordsman, used a flying sword to carry Fei Si's letter, charging all the way to the top of Fire Persimmon Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
The messenger, upon reaching the sky above the mountain, was shocked by the sight of the beast tide at the mountain pass. "The Lava Immortal Palace has several breaches!" <br/>
<br/>
"The beast tide here is truly terrifying! Compared to this, the attack on Immortal City is comparatively small." The messenger was astonished and paid respects to Meng Kui.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui, with a sweep of his divine sense, immediately grasped the contents of the letter. "Ning Zhuo... Soul Devouring Sect... and Void Sect."<br/>
<br/>
This wise general pondered for a few breaths before extending his hand. <br/>
<br/>
Spell: Learning the mysteries within! <br/>
<br/>
The giant hand, formed by Nascent Soul-level mana, carried Fei Si's letter, charged forward while crushing countless demonic beasts, and reached a breach in the light barrier.<br/>
<br/>
Subsequently, a small part of the mana hand separated, enveloping the flying message, and pierced through the air towards a certain place in the Immortal Palace. <br/>
<br/>
Previously, Meng Kui couldn't have achieved this. But with the damage to the Immortal Palace, the power of the restrictions greatly diminished, giving Meng Kui a small opportunity to exert Foundation Establishment-level combat power.<br/>
<br/>
The letter's intended recipient was none other than Zhu Xuanji. Having passed the first round of the palace examination, Zhu Xuanji, unlike the others, didn't actively prepare for the second round but instead came to the Gourd Fire Furnace Forest.<br/>
<br/>
A large group of Scarlet Flame Beasts led by Flame Lizards was charging towards this place. The mechanical constructs responsible for blocking them were quite sparse and many cultivators watched without engaging. This was Zhu Xuanji's deliberate arrangement.<br/>
<br/>
He wanted to approach the Golden Furnace, but it was a critical area of the Gourd Fire Furnace Forest, meaning outsiders like Zhu Xuanji had no right to approach. However, if the Scarlet Flame Beasts reached near the Golden Furnace, Zhu Xuanji would have the opportunity; under the guise of repelling the invaders, he could reach the Golden Furnace, employ his methods, and investigate past events.<br/>
<br/>
The information left by Ning Xiaohui after her death, when deduced by Meng Kui, yielded four clues: Ning Zhuo, Sun Lingtong, Zheng Danlian, and the Golden Furnace. Zhu Xuanji had been fixated on these clues.<br/>
<br/>
His extensive experience in handling cases made him feel that something extremely important was hidden within. Therefore, even with the second round of the palace examination imminent, he had to take this action.<br/>
<br/>
In the Lava Immortal Palace, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit paced nervously. "Zhu Xuanji, Zhu Xuanji! Why do you haunt me like a ghost? Why must you make things difficult for me at every turn?" <br/>
<br/>
"Alas, how unlucky I am to be entangled with you!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit gnashed its teeth, filled with resentment towards Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
With no other choice, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had to suppress its voice and contact Ning Zhuo again. <br/>
<br/>
"Young master, young, young master, it's me, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit." Its tone was extremely weak.<br/>
<br/>
This wasn't entirely an act; with the Lava Immortal Palace damaged, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was indeed in poor condition. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was quite surprised to receive the sudden contact from the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit. He quickly inquired about the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit's condition.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit suppressed its agitation, "Th-thank you, young master, for your concern. Little spirit is not dead yet." <br/>
<br/>
"That Zhu Xuanji is trying to cause trouble again!" <br/>
<br/>
"Right now, he wants to use the beast tide to investigate the Golden Furnace in the Gourd Fire Furnace Forest."<br/>
<br/>
"Young master, I seem to have told you before, didn't I? Yuan Dasheng was made into a mechanical construct by using up a Golden Furnace." <br/>
<br/>
"If Zhu Xuanji discovers this..."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's pupils slightly contracted and he quickly praised the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, indicating he would immediately stop Zhu Xuanji's actions. <br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit showed a hint of excitement and continued in a weak tone, "Young master, you are indeed decisive, unlike ordinary people. Let's cooperate now and use the five elements cannon tower to strike them a hard blow!" <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, however, refused, "This matter is somewhat inappropriate."<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit widened its eyes, anxious, "What's inappropriate? Young master, you mustn't hesitate!" <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed, "My merits... In the last palace examination settlement, my merits were deducted too much. If I hadn't timely submitted my Buddha Heart Demon Seal, I would have lost the opportunity for the palace examination!" <br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit coughed violently twice, "Young master, you are wise and powerful, truly remarkable! Even when little spirit is in a terrible state and unable to care for you, you can make such judgments on your own, unlike ordinary people." <br/>
<br/>
"But now, if Zhu Xuanji discovers something, what use is more merit?" <br/>
<br/>
"Young master, quickly fire the cannon!"<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was so anxious it was spinning in circles. <br/>
<br/>
"Alright!" Ning Zhuo's straightforward answer delighted the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit.<br/>
<br/>
He began to exercise his authority, raising the six-layer five elements cannon tower again, with the cannon muzzles all aimed at the Golden Furnace's location in the Gourd Fire Furnace Forest. Mana surged in, and the cannon muzzles lit up with a bright glow.<br/>
<br/>
"Fire, fire!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was secretly thrilled. <br/>
<br/>
Just as they were about to fire, Ning Zhuo suddenly said, "Oh, by the way, Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, do you know the specific theme of the second round of the palace examination?" <br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit: !!?<br/>
<br/>
At that moment, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit truly wanted to rush to Ning Zhuo and give him a fierce headbutt! At such a critical time, why ask about this and that!<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit shouted, "Young master, quickly fire first. If you don't fire now, it will be too late!" <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head, "I'm very hesitant. If I fire this round, my merits will be deducted again. To participate in the palace examination, I even submitted my Buddha Heart Demon Seal. Therefore, I am determined to win the position of palace master!" <br/>
<br/>
"Quickly tell me the content of the next palace examination."<br/>
<br/>
"Otherwise, if I can't compete for the palace master position and lose my Buddha Heart Demon Seal, I might as well be captured now!" <br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit: ......<br/>
