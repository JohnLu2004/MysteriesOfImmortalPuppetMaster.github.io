<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
A few days ago, Ning Zhuo used the Lingyin Willow to comprehend a cultivation diagram, deepening his insights. Such a treasure could not be easily revealed; otherwise, it would attract greed and potentially lead to disaster. Human nature often cannot withstand such temptations.<br/>
<br/>
Although his relationship with Lin Shanshan and the Myriad Medicine Sect was good so far, he naturally wouldn’t risk exposing the Lingyin Willow to test their trust. There was no need to trigger unnecessary dangers.<br/>
<br/>
With both his cultivation efforts along with Sun Lingtong’s, six branches of the Lingyin Willow had already withered, leaving the tree withered in certain parts, a sight that pained Ning Zhuo. The tree had absorbed all the nutrients from the soil around its roots in an effort to compensate, turning the fertile earth into lifeless sand. <br/>
<br/>
Even with all this, the six branches of the Lingyin Willow still showed only a faint glimmer of recovery. Worried that its condition might worsen, Ning Zhuo knew that transplanting and cultivating the plant properly had become an urgent matter. <br/>
<br/>
“Even if it can't fully recover, at least I need to stabilize its condition,” Ning Zhuo thought. The Lingyin Willow was at the Golden Core level, and higher-level beings required more from their environment. It could not be left to deteriorate any further.<br/>
<br/>
Faced with this situation, Ning Zhuo decided to seek Lin Shanshan’s help. As expected, she didn’t refuse.<br/>
<br/>
After a moment of thought, she said, “This is indeed a difficult matter. Our sect has many records, but we’d have to search through the archives. I can lead you to look at the directories and catalogs. But we need to first identify the type of spiritual plant this is, and that will require your input.”<br/>
<br/>
“Once we know what it is, we can figure out what level of secrecy applies to the information and then determine how you can learn from it. If it’s highly classified, I might not be able to help much on my own.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo sighed, “I have a bad feeling about this. When the mountain god entrusted this to me, it was with great solemnity. The spiritual plant is likely not ordinary.”<br/>
<br/>
“Alas, I’m at my wit's end, which is why I came to trouble you. If it’s too difficult, I’ll find another way.”<br/>
<br/>
Hearing this, Lin Shanshan made up her mind. No matter how difficult it was, she would do her best to help. She encouraged him, “How can we give up before even trying? Let’s first see what we’re dealing with. If I can’t handle it alone, I can always ask for help from others.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly expressed his gratitude.<br/>
<br/>
So, Lin Shanshan led him to the sect’s library to search through books on spiritual plant cultivation. The Myriad Medicine Sect lived up to its reputation; the library had a vast collection of books on this topic. But the Lingyin Willow was extremely rare, and after searching for most of the day, Ning Zhuo finally selected a few books, including Rare Spiritual Plants, Exquisite Flowers of the Immortal Garden, and Wonders of Spiritual Growth.<br/>
<br/>
Feeling a bit embarrassed, Ning Zhuo said to Lin Shanshan, “I think the answer might be in one of these. Looking at the indexes, many entries seem similar.”<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan sighed, holding her forehead. “Oh dear, these books are all from the highest classification level.”<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo hesitated, “If it’s too much trouble for you, let’s not worry about it. I’ll think of another way.”<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan shook her head, “You’re new here, and I’m the only friend you have. How could I not help you?” Determined, she added, “I’ll do my best to get the information. Please go back and wait for my news.”<br/>
<br/>
After thanking her, Ning Zhuo left.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan paced back and forth for a while, considering her options. She quickly dismissed the idea of asking her father, as breaking sect rules, even with his permission, would set a bad example. <br/>
<br/>
“As the sect leader’s daughter, I need to follow the rules,” she thought. “I’ll go to my Senior Brother—his authority is much higher than mine.”<br/>
<br/>
With that, Lin Shanshan headed to the back of Dazheng Peak, passing through the mountain path beside a waterfall and reaching the Wanyao Cave.<br/>
<br/>
“Little Junior Sister, what brings you here at this hour?” Senior Brother Linghu Jiu greeted her with a smile, surprised by her visit.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan got straight to the point, “Senior Brother, I need your help with something.”<br/>
<br/>
Linghu Jiu laughed heartily, “Whatever it is, just say the word!”<br/>
<br/>
Smiling, Lin Shanshan approached him and said, “It’s about Ning Zhuo—do you remember him?”<br/>
<br/>
Linghu Jiu’s eyes flashed, and he laughed again, “How could I forget? Every time you bring me food, you mention him. I’ve heard his name so much that it’s stuck in my ears.”<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan chuckled, then continued, “Ning Zhuo had a fortunate encounter on Cloud Concealment Mountain, where he received a rare spiritual plant from the mountain god, one that’s at the Golden Core level…”<br/>
<br/>
She explained the situation in detail, and Linghu Jiu listened carefully, his expression growing more serious.<br/>
<br/>
“So that’s what happened,” he murmured, stroking his chin.<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan then added, “I don’t have the authority to access the high-level books in the library, so I need your help with your identity token.”<br/>
<br/>
“As for the sect points it will cost, I’ll repay you gradually.”<br/>
<br/>
Linghu Jiu thought for a moment, “Those books will consume a lot of sect points. Little Junior Sister, have you thought this through? You’ve already helped him quite a bit. If you go through with this, it’ll take you a long time to repay.”<br/>
<br/>
“I think exchanging just one of the books should be enough—it won’t be as much of a burden on you.”<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan shook her head, “That won’t do. We’ve only looked at the indexes and summaries. If the book we exchange doesn’t contain the right information, we’d have to exchange another one. It’s better to exchange them all at once.”<br/>
<br/>
“As for the points, even though it’s a lot, I can repay them over time.”<br/>
<br/>
She then playfully added, “You have the most points in the sect, and you don’t use them, so just lend me some!”<br/>
<br/>
Linghu Jiu sighed, “Since you ask, how can I refuse?”<br/>
<br/>
He took his identity token from beside his bed and handed it to her.<br/>
<br/>
But as Lin Shanshan approached to take it, Linghu Jiu suddenly sniffed the air. “Wait, what’s that smell?”<br/>
<br/>
“Wine! That’s the scent of good wine! It smells like Warm Autumn Wine, doesn’t it?”<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan sniffed herself, confused. “I don’t smell anything. I bathe every day.”<br/>
<br/>
She rolled her eyes at him, “All you ever think about is wine. Warm Autumn Wine is a medicinal wine at the Golden Core level. I used it to help heal Ning Zhuo’s injuries, and you just want it to satisfy your cravings!”<br/>
<br/>
“Maybe I picked up some of the scent while training Ning Zhuo in martial arts.”<br/>
<br/>
Lin Shanshan took the token and thanked him, playfully waving as she left.<br/>
<br/>
Linghu Jiu, feeling a bit empty, called after her. She turned back with a puzzled expression, and he hesitated before saying, “Be careful…”<br/>
<br/>
Before he could finish, Lin Shanshan interrupted, “Of course I know that, Senior Brother! Don’t worry.”<br/>
<br/>
“If Ning Zhuo had asked for the cultivation techniques of ordinary herbs, I’d suspect he was gathering information to compete with our sect. But since he’s asking about rare and exotic plants, it won’t harm the sect.”<br/>
<br/>
“I’ve got this! See you tomorrow.”<br/>
<br/>
With that, Lin Shanshan hurried out of the cave.<br/>
<br/>
Linghu Jiu stood there, feeling a bit lost. “I meant to warn you to be careful for yourself…”<br/>
<br/>
After a long pause, he sighed and lay back on his stone bed, trying to sleep. But his mind was troubled, and sleep eluded him. Suddenly, something clicked in his mind.<br/>
<br/>
“Wait—how did my little junior sister get the scent of wine on her?”<br/>
<br/>
“Training him in martial arts… how exactly did that happen?”<br/>
<br/>
Sitting up abruptly, Linghu Jiu's carefree demeanor disappeared, replaced by a sense of urgency and anxiety. He had always enjoyed his time guarding the Wanyao Cave, but now, for the first time, he felt restless and eager to leave.<br/>
<br/>
“How many more months before I can get out of here?!”<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Lin Shanshan, in a whirlwind of energy, used Linghu Jiu’s token to exchange for several secret books. Disguising herself, she went to Little Contention Peak to meet Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
“I didn’t fail you!” She handed the books to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Overjoyed, Ning Zhuo exclaimed, “Miss Lin, you’ve been such a great help! Without your assistance, I would never have been able to obtain these precious books. I cannot express my gratitude enough. How could I, someone so undeserving, have gained a friend as wonderful as you? Your actions are like rain in a drought, a true blessing.”<br/>
<br/>
“I will never forget your kindness, and if there’s ever an opportunity, I will repay you with all my strength.”<br/>
<br/>
Blushing slightly from his praise, Lin Shanshan replied, “Ning Zhuo, you’re being too kind. There’s no need for such words.”<br/>
<br/>
Seeing how excited and sincere he was, the heavy cost she had secretly borne now felt light and insignificant. Lin Shanshan had always been the one receiving help and concessions within the sect, but now, for the first time, she was the one offering such substantial help to someone else.<br/>
<br/>
Her friendship with Ning Zhuo, though still new and filled with a sense of mystery and novelty, had led her to extend a level of assistance she had never given anyone before. And while their time together had been short, Lin Shanshan trusted Ning Zhuo’s character and believed that her wholehearted support would one day be rewarded.<br/>
