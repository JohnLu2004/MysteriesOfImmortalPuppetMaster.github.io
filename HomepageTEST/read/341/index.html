<div class="chapter-headline" id="chapterHeadline"><h2>Chapter 341</h2></div>
<div id="chapterContent">Below the list of prices, there were several detailed rules written in small print.<br/>
For example, the deeper into the underground ore deposit, the more spirit stones would be needed and the shorter the time limit.<br/>
Also, the ore controlled by cultivators could not be privately stored and had to be fully taken out during mining for inspection. Jade Steel Town would take half of it, leaving the other half for the cultivators.<br/>
"Ning Zhuo, look here quickly, it's just as you predicted." Sun Lingtong transmitted to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
Ning Zhuo gave up studying the price list and turned his head to see the wanted poster for that demon black tiger.<br/>
On the wanted poster, the black tiger bared its fangs, with thick blood flowing from its teeth. The artist was quite skilled, capturing the unique temperament of this demon.<br/>
"Black Wind Tiger Demon." Ning Zhuo mumbled, softly reading out the name on the wanted list.<br/>
Besides it, there were several other demons that also looked familiar to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
Upon careful examination, he found they were members of the group of demon cultivators seen in the valley. They were particularly powerful and domineering when fighting over blood food, and could be considered as the small leaders under the Black Wind Tiger Demon.<br/>
"Here's that human cultivator too." Sun Lingtong said again, his observational skills much stronger than Ning Zhuo's.<br/>
In the western valley, there was only one human cultivator, a Foundation Establishment cultivator, being used as a servant by the tiger demon.<br/>
Ning Zhuo looked over as directed, but unexpectedly found that this human cultivator wasn't on the wanted list, but rather in a missing person notice.<br/>
The human cultivator was named Shi Sui, skilled in earth-based magic, and was the son of the previous town chief. Ever since the Black Wind Tiger Demon led an attack on the mountain town, killing many cultivators including the previous town chief, this Shi Sui had gone missing after the battle and hadn't been found to this day.<br/>
Sun Lingtong: "This tiger demon was able to attack the mountain town, so its battle power is formidable. Shi Sui was probably captured in that battle and has been held in the western valley ever since, not killed but used as a servant to serve it."<br/>
"When we poison the tiger demon next, Shi Sui might be able to act as our insider. After all, his father died at the hands of the tiger demon! I thought he might have been a traitor."<br/>
Sun Lingtong looked at Ning Zhuo and smiled: "This way, after we kill the Black Wind Tiger Demon, we'll have a bounty to collect, not bad, not bad. Shall we claim the bounty now?"<br/>
But Ning Zhuo stopped him: "Boss, no rush, let's explore the town a bit more first."<br/>
"Hmm, I'll listen to you then." Sun Lingtong said.<br/>
Ever since the Lava Immortal Palace incident, Sun Lingtong had fully witnessed Ning Zhuo's strategic abilities. He was very self-aware, knowing that in terms of strategy and planning, this little brother he had trained was both cunning and vicious, definitely far surpassing himself.<br/>
The two then disguised themselves as scattered cultivators coming to mine, each paying fifty spirit stones to enter the small town.<br/>
The streets in the small town were very wide, with large mechanical vehicles moving about.<br/>
On both sides of the streets stood simple stone houses. The stone houses shimmered with jade light under the sun, obviously made by cultivators using local materials.<br/>
The town was bustling with people coming and going, the shouts of merchants and the laughter of miners intertwining.<br/>
Many cultivators bared their chests, with bulging muscles, coarse voices, and bold manners, clearly body cultivators.<br/>
Besides these, there were mostly gold cultivators and earth cultivators.<br/>
These three types of cultivators were most suitable as miners.<br/>
Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong first went to find a teahouse, ordered a plate of jade rhinoceros meat, three taels of jade dew wine, and ate and drank while listening to the discussions of the cultivators.<br/>
When the waiter came to serve, Ning Zhuo took out a spirit stone and gave it to him as a reward for inquiries.<br/>
After a series of questions, the two obtained much intelligence about the mountain town.<br/>
For example, the previous family chief was harsh and petty. If any cultivator was found trying to smuggle anything out, they would be severely punished immediately, without any leniency.<br/>
Also, the current town chief's surname is Meng, with the given name Zizhong, from the Meng family of the Southern Bean Country, of noble birth.<br/>
After Meng Zizhong took office, he was generous in style, lax in supervision, diligent in training soldiers, and fond of martial arts. He often led cultivators out of town, actively sweeping the areas around Jade Steel Mountain, clearing out all threatening beasts and demon cultivators, very responsible.<br/>
And his own powerful martial force also provided the townspeople with a sense of security. In terms of reputation, he was much better than the previous town chief.<br/>
Sun Youlingtong said: "Meng Zizhong comes from the Meng family, with a strong martial tradition. Judging from his posting of wanted posters and constant search for the Night Wind Tiger Demon, if we claim the bounty and find him, he will definitely be pleased and give us detailed information about the demon."<br/>
But Ning Zhuo pondered for a moment and shook his head slightly: "No rush, boss. Since we're here, let's go take a look at the mine."<br/>
Sun Lingtong exclaimed: "Just for a hundred low-grade spirit stones... you still care about these trifles?"<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled and said: "From childhood to now, I've never mined like this before."<br/>
Sun Youlingtong put his hands behind his head: "Ah, you're still too young. What's so fun about mining!"<br/>
Soon after.<br/>
The two were mining on the first ore layer.<br/>
"Look, look, what did I dig up! Such a big piece of jade-infused dark steel." Sun Lingtong showed off.<br/>
"Impressive, boss." Ning Zhuo smiled faintly.<br/>
"Look here, I just felt something wasn't quite right about this place. After breaking open the jade steel, guess what, I found this!" Sun Lingtong took out an associated ore, boasting.<br/>
This was a piece of sky-fallen stone, with a waxy texture, grayish in color, a classic pigment raw material used in the painting art among the hundred arts of immortal cultivation.<br/>
Ning Zhuo gave a thumbs up.<br/>
Sun Lingtong grinned, rubbing his hands excitedly, and pounced on the ore bed.<br/>
His face was almost pressed against the stone surface, light flickering in his eyes. He was using his innate spirit eyes, allowing him to discern more accurately, penetrate deeper, and discover more and better quality ores.<br/>
Sun Lingtong dug and dug, immersed in it.<br/>
When Ning Zhuo almost dragged him out, Sun Lingtong was still reluctant to leave: "We haven't used up our time limit yet, fifty spirit stones per person, we should at least break even, right?"<br/>
"Boss, you've more than broken even already, haven't you?" Ning Zhuo communicated telepathically while approaching the supervisor, taking out all the mined ores.<br/>
The supervisor picked through some ores, then used a magical tool to scan Ning Zhuo's entire body before waving him away.<br/>
Sun Lingtong had secretly kept many of the more precious ores, only handing over some jade-infused dark steel ores.<br/>
The supervisor's magical tool couldn't detect anything, so he similarly waved Sun Lingtong through.<br/>
Sun and Ning walked together on the street.<br/>
Ning Zhuo transmitted a message, sighing: "Jade Steel Mountain is truly blessed by heaven, with such rich deposits of jade-infused dark steel. If one person could occupy this, relying on this mountain alone could develop and expand, branching out to become a large-scale immortal cultivation family."<br/>
Sun Lingtong shrugged: "Although Jade Steel Mountain is good, it's far inferior compared to Fire Persimmon Mountain. It can only support a mountain town, while the resources in Fire Persimmon Mountain can support an immortal city."<br/>
"The resources in Fire Persimmon Mountain can be said to be inexhaustible, cyclical. Every bit mined from Jade Steel Mountain reduces the reserves and cannot be sustained forever."<br/>
Ning Zhuo shook his head slightly: "Boss, you still don't understand my meaning. Let me be frank, I am the patriarch of the Ning family branch, and my poor branch has just been established, with everything waiting to be built up. Just having some duties in the Lava Immortal Palace doesn't amount to much."<br/>
"We don't have any reliable family business."<br/>
"What do you think about this Jade Steel Mountain?"<br/>
Sun Lingtong froze, not quite understanding why Ning Zhuo suddenly brought this up.<br/>
"Weren't we supposed to be collecting your mother's relics?"<br/>
"Then we discovered the Black Wind Tiger Demon, and only by eliminating it can we possibly obtain what we want."<br/>
"How come you've now set your sights on Jade Steel Mountain? What's this all about?"<br/>
Ning Zhuo's smile deepened: "It's all part of the same plan."<br/>
Seeing that Ning Zhuo was serious, Sun Youlingtong began to think for him, pondered for a while, but couldn't figure it out, quite troubled: "This town is guarded by Meng Zizhong, he has a strong background, how do you plan to overthrow him? And how can you get your branch family involved?"<br/>
Ning Zhuo's eyes were deep: "How about this, we fabricate some evidence to prove that Meng Zizhong has a secret connection with the Black Wind Tiger Demon."<br/>
Sun Lingtong: "You want to frame him? That's very difficult, not easy to do."<br/>
"Don't forget about Zhu Xuanji’s innate talent."<br/>
Ning Zhuo laughed: "Boss, I want to give it a try."<br/>
Sun Youlingtong felt excited: "I already feel that this matter will be very interesting and thrilling."<br/>
So, the two left the mountain town and used the Ten Thousand Li Dragon to return to Misty Concealment Mountain.<br/>
The mechanical dragon slipped into the depths of the valley, discovering the human cultivator Shi Sui in a corner.<br/>
Sun Lingtong made his move, directly knocking Shi Sui unconscious and stuffing him into the Ten Thousand Li Dragon.<br/>
Sun and Ning returned to Jade Steel Mountain and released Shi Sui.<br/>
Ning Zhuo used the Life-Hanging-by-a-Thread divine ability to plant something in Shi Sui.<br/>
When Shi Sui woke up and found he had escaped, he was extremely shocked.<br/>
Ning Zhuo seized the opportunity to transmit a message to him, assuming the identity of an otherworldly expert, telling Shi Sui that it was he who had saved him, but fearing trouble, he didn't want to break his secluded life, so he brought Shi Sui to Jade Steel Mountain, letting him report to Meng Zizhong.<br/>
Shi Sui was immediately overjoyed, kowtowing several times on the spot, then rushed into Meng Zizhong's mansion.<br/>
Ignoring the doorkeeper's obstruction, he came to the small courtyard, shouting loudly.<br/>
This alarmed Meng Zizhong.<br/>
Meng Zizhong led Shi Sui into the study and questioned him carefully.<br/>
Shi Sui told everything without holding back, very emotional.<br/>
Meng Zizhong asked: "Did you really escape on your own?"<br/>
Shi Sui, following the "otherworldly expert's" instructions, didn't reveal the latter's identity, nodded affirmatively, saying he had prepared for many years and finally seized an opportunity a few days ago, running for his life all the way to Jade Steel Mountain, to seek justice from the Southern Bean Country and avenge his grudge!<br/>
"Lord Meng, when will you send troops?" Shi Sui asked full of expectation.<br/>
A sword pierced through Shi Sui's chest.<br/>
Shi Sui was shocked beyond belief, looking at the hand on the sword hilt, then following the arm up, he saw Meng Zizhong's face.<br/>
The next moment, Shi Sui died.<br/>
In the Ten Thousand Li Dragon, this scene was faithfully recorded.<br/>
Sun Lingtong was extremely surprised: "What's going on? This Meng Zizhong really does have issues?!"<br/>
He suddenly turned his head to look at Ning Zhuo: "Little brother, how did you know?"<br/>
"We were acting together all along, weren't we?"<br/>
