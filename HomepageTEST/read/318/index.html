Secret Pavilion of Opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
"Damn it, what does the real exit look like? This is so frustrating!" Chi Dun charged forward recklessly, crashing through one door after another.<br/>
<br/>
But behind each door was yet another secret pavilion.<br/>
<br/>
Pavilion after pavilion... Chi Dun suspected he had fallen into an endless loop.<br/>
<br/>
"If I had known it would be like this, I might as well have stayed to guard Fire Persimmon Immortal City and battled the Scarlet Flame Beasts!" But there was no choice.<br/>
<br/>
This was a direct order from Meng Kui!<br/>
<br/>
"Hmm?"<br/>
<br/>
After crashing into one pavilion, his eyes suddenly brightened as he saw a Shadow Demon Cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
The Shadow Demon Cultivator opened a door and vanished in a flash.<br/>
<br/>
"Where do you think you're going!" Chi Dun was overjoyed and quickly gave chase.<br/>
<br/>
After pursuing through three pavilions, the Shadow Demon Cultivator seemed to have a clear goal. Chi Dun noticed that each time the opponent chose a door, it was without hesitation and with a methodical approach.<br/>
<br/>
The distance between them continued to shrink.<br/>
<br/>
Chi Dun finally caught up with the Shadow Demon Cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
He punched with all his might, his fist carrying immense force, tearing through the air with a powerful gust.<br/>
<br/>
The Shadow Demon Cultivator turned mid-air, raising an arm to block.<br/>
<br/>
Boom!<br/>
<br/>
With a loud crash, the Shadow Demon Cultivator was sent flying back at an even faster speed.<br/>
<br/>
Chi Dun remained in place, gritting his teeth.<br/>
<br/>
A large orange-yellow talisman was imprinted on his chest, its edges spreading outwards, forming a massive sealing force.<br/>
<br/>
Chi Dun's eyes were bloodshot, his body and mind filled with violent rage!<br/>
<br/>
He pushed his Golden Core stage power to the limit, his muscles tensing, heat rising, and his tendons bulging like dragons.<br/>
<br/>
He exerted all his strength to slowly lift his head, a simple action that felt as difficult as lifting a mountain due to the seal talisman.<br/>
<br/>
Chi Dun ignored all this, staring intently in the direction the Shadow Demon Cultivator had fled, roaring in his heart: "It's him!"<br/>
<br/>
Despite only a brief encounter, Chi Dun immediately realized that this was the same Shadow Demon Cultivator he had previously fought and chased into the Fire Persimmon Forest!<br/>
<br/>
"I can't believe I found you, ah!!!" Chi Dun shouted, breaking the seal talisman on his body with a full-force swing of his arm.<br/>
<br/>
Blood gushed from his mouth and nose.<br/>
<br/>
But he paid no heed, driven by the fury in his heart, charging towards the direction where the Shadow Demon Cultivator had disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
Bang, bang, bang.<br/>
<br/>
The sound of doors crashing and closing blended into one.<br/>
<br/>
"Who goes there?" A Golden Core disciple of the Purple Dawn Pavilion was also exploring the secret pavilion.<br/>
<br/>
Within his divine sense range, a cultivator with a Golden Core aura suddenly appeared.<br/>
<br/>
"Shadow Demon Cultivator? Heh, I'm one too!" The Purple Dawn Pavilion disciple's smile quickly faded as he realized the other was heading straight for him.<br/>
<br/>
The Purple Dawn Pavilion disciple's face turned solemn, fully alert.<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, the Shadow Demon Cultivator burst into the pavilion, and the two faced each other.<br/>
<br/>
The Shadow Demon Cultivator didn't pause, choosing the door on the left and entering again.<br/>
<br/>
The Purple Dawn Pavilion disciple relaxed, but his divine sense detected another Golden Core cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
It was Chi Dun!<br/>
<br/>
He tensed up again.<br/>
<br/>
After all, this time he was disguised as a Shadow Demon Cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
Chi Dun saw the Purple Dawn Pavilion disciple and didn't care, diving into the left door.<br/>
<br/>
Under Chi Dun's divine sense, he had already detected the strong aura of the Purple Dawn Pavilion disciple but kept his focus on the previous Shadow Demon Cultivator.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Chi Dun leave in a hurry, the Purple Dawn Pavilion disciple relaxed again.<br/>
<br/>
He was about to continue exploring but suddenly changed his mind. He had no leads himself, and seeing Chi Dun's determined look, he decided to follow and see!<br/>
<br/>
Chi Dun was still within the divine sense of the Purple Dawn Pavilion disciple, who decisively moved.<br/>
<br/>
The pursuit continued.<br/>
<br/>
"Quick, help me stop that Shadow Demon Cultivator ahead!" Chi Dun's divine sense detected a Meng family Golden Core cultivator, and he quickly sent a message seeking help.<br/>
<br/>
The Meng family Golden Core cultivator, having been defeated and fleeing due to Zheng Dan's betrayal, had taken a pill and was resting.<br/>
<br/>
Receiving Chi Dun's message, he immediately cooperated.<br/>
<br/>
The Shadow Demon Cultivator was held up by the Meng family Golden Core, allowing Chi Dun to catch up again.<br/>
<br/>
The three began to battle in the pavilion!<br/>
<br/>
Boom, boom.<br/>
<br/>
Thick black smoke exploded, poisoning divine senses.<br/>
<br/>
In the smoke, several black pythons pierced through the battlefield, forcing Chi Dun and the Meng family Golden Core to retreat.<br/>
<br/>
The ferocity of the attack slowed even the approaching Purple Dawn Pavilion Golden Core.<br/>
<br/>
The Shadow Demon Cultivator repelled the two enemies and withdrew.<br/>
<br/>
Chi Dun and the Meng family Golden Core broke free from the smoke and continued their relentless pursuit.<br/>
<br/>
Within their divine sense, Zhu Xuanji suddenly appeared!<br/>
<br/>
The two Golden Core cultivators were filled with doubt.<br/>
<br/>
Chi Dun, however, was overjoyed.<br/>
<br/>
By common sense, the Meng family and Zhu Xuanji were already at odds. But Chi Dun, being a physical cultivator, didn't think much and directly sent a message: "Divine Constable Zhu, ahead is the Shadow Demon Cultivator who fled into the Fire Persimmon Forest!"<br/>
<br/>
"Oh?" Zhu Xuanji's eyes gleamed upon hearing this, and he immediately set off.<br/>
<br/>
He too joined the pursuit.<br/>
<br/>
However, he was further away than the Meng family Golden Core and Chi Dun.<br/>
<br/>
The pursuit team was growing!<br/>
<br/>
Another Shadow Demon Cultivator appeared within everyone's divine sense range.<br/>
<br/>
Chi Dun and the Meng family Golden Core didn't recognize him, but Zhu Xuanji knew the true identity.<br/>
<br/>
"Brother Zhou, quickly block that person!" Zhu Xuanji sent a message through divine sense.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Nongying, disguised as a Shadow Demon Cultivator, naturally needed his own people to know. Especially Zhu Xuanji! Otherwise, being killed by his own people would be too unjust.<br/>
<br/>
Receiving the message, Zhou Nongying immediately threw out a formation disk, setting up a formation at the door.<br/>
<br/>
The Shadow Demon Cultivator opened the door and fell into the formation.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Nongying's smile froze on his face the next moment.<br/>
<br/>
The formation rose, its patterns twisted, space rippled, and the Shadow Demon Cultivator passed through the ripples, easily escaping the formation.<br/>
<br/>
"Divine Abilityâ€”Escape in Battle?!" Zhou Nongying's heart sank.<br/>
<br/>
His entire skill set was almost entirely focused on formations.<br/>
<br/>
The Shadow Demon Cultivator mastering this divine ability was his nemesis!<br/>
<br/>
The Shadow Demon Cultivator charged straight at him.<br/>
<br/>
Zhou Nongying's heart raced, his fighting spirit wavered, and he instinctively retreated to the side, creating distance.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, he left the door behind him open, allowing the Shadow Demon Cultivator to push through.<br/>
<br/>
Realizing his mistake, Zhou Nongying didn't dare pursue and hurriedly began dismantling the formation to avoid blocking his own people.<br/>
<br/>
Setting up the formation was easy, but dismantling it was relatively difficult, and he was in a frantic rush.<br/>
<br/>
Through divine sense communication, Zhu Xuanji learned from Zhou Nongying that the Shadow Demon Cultivator possessed the divine ability to escape in battle, and his heart sank.<br/>
<br/>
Countless clues in his mind surfaced, showing signs of connecting.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, the Shadow Demon Cultivator took the initiative to contact Zhu Xuanji through divine sense: "Divine Constable Zhu, instead of chasing me, why not investigate the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit!"<br/>
<br/>
"Let me tell you: over the years, the Dragon Turtle has exploited small loopholes in authority, modifying the Lava Immortal Palace. It constructed several channels from the Qi pool, seemingly stealing Qi, accumulating bit by bit for unknown purposes." Zhu Xuanji's heart sank, thinking of the Ten Thousand Mile Wandering Dragon.<br/>
<br/>
He snorted coldly, continuing the pursuit.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, Zhu Xuanji sent messages through divine sense, instructing the Shadow Demon Cultivator to stop and accept investigation; meanwhile, he contacted Zhu Zhen, informing him of this crucial clue.<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Zhen was overjoyed upon receiving the clue: "Brother, in my previous investigation, I did find some structures that seemed redundant, temporarily added. Following this lead, I might find the hidden Ten Thousand Mile Wandering Dragon!" He immediately took action.<br/>
<br/>
This move thoroughly alarmed the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit!<br/>
<br/>
"What is Zhu Zhen looking for?"<br/>
<br/>
"You're not dealing with the numerous beasts, not fighting other Golden Cores, what are you looking for?!" Zhu Zhen's target was so obvious, he was following the Qi channels, tracing the source.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was furious.<br/>
<br/>
It was anxious!<br/>
<br/>
"I've been exposed!"<br/>
<br/>
"The Ten Thousand Mile Wandering Dragon is exposed too!!"<br/>
<br/>
"Damn it, when did the Zhu family learn this secret?"<br/>
<br/>
It wanted to escape now, to dive into the Ten Thousand Mile Wandering Dragon and leave.<br/>
<br/>
Impossible!<br/>
<br/>
The Lava Immortal Palace still bound it, preventing escape.<br/>
<br/>
"Meng Chong, you useless fool!" it roared, furious.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Chong was already at a disadvantage in his battle with Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo released several mechanical constructs to guard himself, resisting Meng Chong's relentless attacks. Meanwhile, he stood at the door, assembling wooden blocks.<br/>
<br/>
This situation plunged the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit into despair.<br/>
<br/>
It was extremely anxious, knowing Meng Chong was bound to lose.<br/>
<br/>
To resolve the predicament, a breakthrough was necessary!<br/>
<br/>
With no other choice, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit mustered its courage, breaking its own limits, and contacted Meng Kui!<br/>
<br/>
"Meng Kui, if you don't act now, it'll be too late!!" "Who?" Meng Kui was surprised.<br/>
<br/>
The next moment, he smiled slightly: "Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, you finally stopped playing dead and contacted me. Rest assured, everything is under my control..."<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit roared in anger, interrupting him: "Fool! You have no idea, that Ning Zhuo..." It had just begun when a fiery guillotine formed instantly.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit couldn't move, awaiting execution!<br/>
<br/>
The guillotine fell mercilessly, beheading the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit once more, its head and body separating. The dragon head's eyes widened, rolling to the ground, then transforming into specks of spiritual light, drifting away.<br/>
<br/>
The Lava Immortal Palace strictly prohibited revealing cultivator information, and the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, in its anxiety, violated the rule, getting beheaded before it could speak.<br/>
<br/>
The information it wanted to reveal was thus halted.<br/>
<br/>
"Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit?" Meng Kui's calls received no response.<br/>
<br/>
In an instant, his heart sank!<br/>
<br/>
"I was blinded by fate energy, thinking everything was under control."<br/>
<br/>
Though the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit didn't speak, it was enough for the wise Meng Kui!<br/>
<br/>
Seizing this opportunity, he saw through the illusion of fate energy, his mind becoming completely clear.<br/>
<br/>
He intended to use his divine ability to observe the battlefield's fate energy pattern.<br/>
<br/>
The timing was wrong!<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui sensed the opportunity slipping from his grasp, calculating with furrowed brows, growing tighter.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit panted heavily, regaining its vision.<br/>
<br/>
Its form was less than thirty percent of its complete state, its body dim and lifeless, filled with lingering fear, its spirit exhausted.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui's divine sense kept calling: "Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, if you want freedom, you must join forces with me! Do you know, Zhu Xuanji already knows your disloyalty?" "It was Ning Zhuo who harmed me!" At this point, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit could only think of the paper Ning Zhuo gave Zhu Xuanji, that poem! It couldn't guess wrong, this was Ning Zhuo's scheme!<br/>
<br/>
"Are you bullying me because I don't understand literature?!"<br/>
<br/>
"Plotting against me right in front of my face. Despicable, truly despicable!" Meng Kui took a deep breath, casting his spell with all his might.<br/>
<br/>
Two Qi hands abandoned the front line, flying towards the lightning wall formed by the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities. They dissolved automatically, eroding the pavilion.<br/>
<br/>
Techniqueâ€”Immediate Retribution!<br/>
<br/>
In the world, karma and retribution are inevitable, only awaiting the right time.</div>
