Sun Lingtong was naturally adept at spreading rumors.

With considerable experience, he estimated, "By that time, the situation will be very tense. The third wave of rumors is indeed crucial. We must act quickly, or our opponents will easily detect and extinguish the rumors once they start to spread."

Ning Zhuo, however, shook his head slightly, holding a different view.

He told Sun Lingtong, "I would prefer that the third wave of rumors not be spread by us." Sun Lingtong was immediately intrigued, "Xiao Zhuo, do you have other forces at your disposal?" Ning Zhuo smiled, "Boss, I do have my secrets, but in terms of influence, how could I compare to you?" This statement made Sun Lingtong even more curious, prompting him to ask, "If that's the case, who else can help us spread the rumors?" Ning Zhuo shook his head, "I can't say for sure, and I don't have complete confidence in this." "But I still think that when it's time to spread the third wave of rumors, we should wait a bit." "Are you sure?" Sun Lingtong felt concerned.

When it came to spreading rumors, he was highly experienced and professional.

He had accurately predicted the future situation: "If we spread the third wave of rumors at the normal speed, by that time, there won't be enough time or space left." "In such a scenario, should we still wait for another wave, observe the situation, and then spread the third wave of rumors?" Ning Zhuo nodded, "I believe this risk is worth taking."

"The first two rumors we spread were fine, but if we personally spread the third wave, it could become a flaw." "On this point, Boss, I want to take a gamble!" Sun Lingtong laughed heartily, patting Ning Zhuo on the shoulder, "Alright, Xiao Zhuo, you understand the rules of the righteous path better than I do." "I'll gamble with you."

A little girl with a face as red as an apple suddenly leaned over, occupying Sun Lingtong's view and interrupting his thoughts. "Grandpa, why are you lying here? Do you need help getting up?" the little girl asked in a childish voice.

Sun Lingtong quickly sighed and thanked the little girl, indicating that he indeed needed help.

The little girl used all her strength to help Sun Lingtong up.

Sun Lingtong transmitted his voice to her, "I didn't expect you to shake off Zhu Xuanji so quickly!" The little girl was none other than Yang Chanyu in disguise.

Yang Chanyu smiled lightly and responded via voice transmission, "If it were in the wilderness, Zhu Xuanji's Golden Talent would indeed be hard to maintain." "But the terrain of Fire Persimmon Immortal City is complex, not an open area, and with the formation gaps you provided, how could I let Zhu Xuanji catch me?"

Zhu Xuanji returned empty-handed.

Facing Ning Jiufan and the other four Golden Core Stage cultivators who had rushed over, he said directly, "I lost her, but I'm sure it was Yang Chanyu." The other five Golden Core Stage cultivators fell silent for a moment.

Ning Jiufan sighed, "We couldn't catch Yang Chanyu, and our trap here has been exposed. Should we still guard Ning Zhuo?" Zhu Xuanji nodded.

On the way back, he had already thought of the next steps.

He said, "Currently, we can't determine Yang Chanyu's purpose. She might be coveting the Demonic Dao Scripture herself, or she might have been hired by the City Lord's Mansion." Saying this, Zhu Xuanji looked regretful, "If only I could have captured Yang Chanyu." "Now, we still have no evidence."

Even Zhu Xuanji's personal efforts couldn't capture Yang Chanyu.

This result left the five Golden Core Stage cultivators deeply disappointed and worried.

Zhu Xuanji saw their expressions and sighed, continuing to explain, "Yang Chanyu took advantage of the terrain, slipping through the gaps in the Immortal City Grand Formation to escape successfully." Ning Jiufan said, "We can't blame Lord Zhu for this. In such a situation, it would be difficult for anyone to catch Yang Chanyu." Zhou Nongying snorted coldly, "The situation is actually quite clear. The City Lord's Mansion must have hired Yang Chanyu to test us! And to ensure their safety and Yang Chanyu's, they provided a formation gap." Zhu Xuanji shook his head, "We can't confirm that yet because we have no evidence." Zheng Danlian sighed, "Honestly, this is the City Lord's Mansion's negligence!"

"According to common sense, the protective formation of the Immortal City should be changed periodically for safety." "But the recent City Lords haven't done this. I guess they find it too troublesome and thankless." Zhu Xuanji's lips moved slightly, but he didn't speak.

He knew some internal details about this matter.

It was intentionally neglected by the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family.

After all, Fire Persimmon Immortal City was located in the heart of the Southern Bean Kingdom and was relatively safe.

Changing the protective formation would indeed be labor-intensive and costly.

As a new city, Fire Persimmon Immortal City had its own specialties, providing substantial tax revenue to the royal family every year.

Changing the protective formation would sharply reduce the royal family's income!

Zhou Nongying suddenly said, "The current situation has evolved to a point where it's very unfavorable for us. We're too passive." "Our manpower is all tied up with Ning Zhuo." "Even if an assassin comes, as long as we can't catch him, we can't determine if it's the City Lord's Mansion's doing or the assassin's personal greed." "Fei Si is very cunning! I think he might have already seen through our intentions and is implementing a delaying tactic." "Every now and then, he just needs to send or hire Yang Chanyu to test us, and we'll be firmly tied up. Most of our energy will be focused on protecting Ning Zhuo." "This way, we'll be even more passive."

"So I think, instead of always being on the defensive, we should take the initiative." Zheng Shuangjun asked curiously, "So how do we take the initiative?" Zhou Nongying smiled slightly, "This matter is actually very simple. Far easier than you think." "Aren't there rumors being spread? I believe a large part of them is the work of the City Lord's Mansion." "Now we also spread rumors, dragging the City Lord's Mansion directly into the fray, won't that be good?"

Thus, the third wave of rumors emerged.

The rumors were detailed, describing Ning Zhuo, the Mechanical Fire Monkey, Yuan Dasheng, the Fire Persimmon Festival, and other events.

It highlighted how Ning Zhuo, at sixteen, sought advice from Chen Cha, only to have his research credit stolen by the City Lord's Mansion.

It also mentioned how Fei Si deceived and mass-produced the Mechanical Fire Monkey.

Finally, during the Fire Persimmon Festival, Fei Si, holding the latter's waist token, forced Yuan Er to let Yuan Dasheng die.

The rumors immediately sparked three thoughts among the listeners.

First, Ning Zhuo was too young and was taken advantage of, evoking sympathy.

Second, the City Lord's Mansion might have already obtained the Demonic Dao Scripture, and Fei Si used Ning Zhuo to kill Yuan Dasheng.

Third, the Demonic Dao Scripture might be in the City Lord's Mansion.

The City Lord's Mansion was the mastermind and the biggest winner!

For a time, the entire city began to discuss: Where exactly is the Demonic Dao Scripture? In the hands of the City Lord's Mansion or with Ning Zhuo? And Yang Chanyu's probing, leaving with a remark "So that's how it is," was also widely spread.

City Lord's Mansion.

Fei Si escorted the Book Master out of the mansion.

Returning alone to his desk, his face was very gloomy.

The Book Master was a Golden Core Stage cultivator from the All-Book Pavilion.

He had come to Fire Persimmon Immortal City to establish and oversee a branch of the All-Book Pavilion while actively exploring the Lava Immortal Palace, quickly accumulating many achievements.

The Book Master had come to Fei Si with a transaction proposal.

If the City Lord's Mansion had the Demonic Dao Scripture, the All-Book Pavilion would buy it at a high price.

Fei Si knew nothing about the Demonic Dao Scripture and told the Book Master that the deal couldn't be made.

Finally, Fei Si saw the Book Master out of the mansion.

"Even the Book Master believes that this third wave of rumors is targeting me and the City Lord's Mansion!" "Who wants to deal with me?!" Fei Si felt that his enemy's intentions were becoming clear.

He had felt something was wrong with the first two waves of rumors and had been secretly paying attention.

Now, the third wave of rumors directly implied that the City Lord's Mansion had secretly obtained the Demonic Dao Scripture! Fei Si felt the gravity of the situation and immediately ordered a thorough investigation.

During his investigation, another night passed.

No moon.

Stars dotted the sky.

A thunderous explosion disturbed the city's residents from their sleep.

People rushed out to check.

Some saw Yang Chanyu fighting a Golden Core Stage cultivator, retreating as they fought. "Yang Chanyu?!" "Wait, her opponent is... a Shadow Demon Cultivator!!" In an instant, the cultivators who saw this scene widened their eyes.

After many days, the Shadow Demon Cultivator had finally reappeared.

The next moment, the Shadow Demon Cultivator shouted, "Demoness, leave the scripture behind!" The cultivators felt a chill in their hearts. "Scripture?" "What scripture?!" "Yang Chanyu escaped from the City Lord's Mansion. Could it be that she stole the Demonic Dao Scripture from the City Lord's Mansion?!"</div>
