Fire Persimmon Immortal City. <br/>
<br/>
Dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
Han Ming looked at Fei Si, felt a chill in her heart, and sneered, "You're delusional!"<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si's eyes glimmered with a ghostly light as he calmly said, "If you refuse to cooperate with my investigation, don't blame me for using torture. Even the mere branding punishment would be difficult for you to endure."<br/>
<br/>
"From then on, your face will bear the mark of a criminal. As long as you operate within the Southern Bean Kingdom, this mark will reveal your presence, making you known to all. This mark will also suppress your cultivation, making cultivation arduous."<br/>
<br/>
"And to remove this mark, you would at least need to find a Nascent Soul level figure. Do you want to try?"<br/>
<br/>
Han Ming felt an even deeper chill in her heart but her outward appearance remained unafraid. She raised her head, "What's the use in saying that much? Come on, bring whatever punishment you have."<br/>
<br/>
"I had already prepared for the worst since I turned myself in. Fei Si, do you want me to serve you, to assist you in cultivation? Hmph, dream on!"<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si chuckled, "Since you were used as a pawn by Luo Shang and sacrificed here, why are you still being stubborn? How could I not know the ways of your demonic dao people? What, do you really want to die for Luo Shang?"<br/>
<br/>
"How about this, I'll give you two choices. The first is to help me enhance my soul foundation. The second is to reveal Luo Shang's whereabouts. Think it over."<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, Han Ming hesitated.<br/>
<br/>
But she quickly became resolute again, "Fei Si, you're unworthy of being a righteous Golden Core! I choose nothing. Bring whatever tricks you have." <br/>
<br/>
Fei Si snorted coldly, his hand like a blade, slashing down directly.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately, a spell shot out like a sharp blade, aimed straight for Han Ming's neck.<br/>
<br/>
Han Ming instantly felt a strong threat of death. Alarms rang in her heart but she was bound in place, unable to move.<br/>
<br/>
"Am I going to die?!" <br/>
<br/>
At this moment, Han Ming roared unwillingly in her heart.<br/>
<br/>
She did not die.<br/>
<br/>
At the critical moment, a ghostly hand emerged from her body. It directly grabbed Fei Si's spell and crushed it.<br/>
<br/>
A Ghost General then emerged from Han Ming's body and spoke in Luo Shang's voice, "Alright, Fei Si, stop scaring the junior." <br/>
<br/>
"Luo Shang! When did he plant this method on me?" Han Ming was shocked.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, she felt fortunate.<br/>
<br/>
She had made the right choice!<br/>
<br/>
She chose not to escape, came to the City Lord's Mansion to turn herself in, and did not succumb to Fei Si's coercion, never giving Luo Shang an opportunity to eliminate her for sect treachery.<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si showed no surprise at the appearance of the Golden Core Ghost General.<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Core-level Ghost General, serving as Luo Shang's messenger, floated into the air, "Alright, Fei Si, your actions are merely to force me to show up. What do you want?" <br/>
<br/>
Fei Si indeed changed his previous attitude, stroking his beard with a smile, "Luo Shang, you sent Han Ming to report, merely to sow discord and create chaos for your own benefit. Let me tell you, our side and Zhu Xuanji's side have long united and formed an alliance in private. Our Southern Bean Kingdom will not easily let outsiders like you exploit us!"<br/>
<br/>
"However..."<br/>
<br/>
"We also know your sect's goal is not the Lava Immortal Palace, but the abundant soul reserves beneath Fire Persimmon Mountain. As long as you don't touch the Lava Immortal Palace, we actually have a basis for cooperation." <br/>
<br/>
This piece of intelligence was obtained by prying open the mouths of the hook-nosed and triangular-eyed disciples of the Soul Devouring Sect.<br/>
<br/>
Even without this intelligence, based on the Soul Devouring Sect's past behavior, goals, and plans, it wasn't hard to guess.<br/>
<br/>
Luo Shang was silent for a moment before then asking, "How do we cooperate?"<br/>
<br/>
"How can I trust you? What do you righteous people want to cooperate with us demonic cultivators for? I won't be your pawn!"<br/>
<br/>
Fei Si stroked his beard, exuding an air of calmness, "Let me tell you, recruiting you demonic outsiders is not only the intention of Lord City Master Meng, but it's also in line with Zhu Xuanji's attitude. As long as you fully assist in defending the city, we are willing to secretly cooperate with the Soul Devouring Sect to jointly develop the massive soul reserves beneath Fire Persimmon Mountain!" <br/>
<br/>
Luo Shang fell silent again.<br/>
<br/>
He pondered for a long time before saying, "I am indeed very interested in this cooperation!"<br/>
<br/>
This time, he came to Fire Persimmon Immortal City with a sect mission. On one hand, to seek justice for Qi Bai's death and uphold the sect's reputation. On the other hand, to continue Qi Bai's unfinished business and explore how many soul reserves lie beneath Fire Persimmon Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
If at this moment, he could cooperate with the City Lord's Mansion and Zhu Xuanji's side, it would greatly help in completing these two tasks!<br/>
<br/>
Luo Shang's statement made Han Ming secretly breathe a sigh of relief.<br/>
<br/>
She understood that she was saved!<br/>
<br/>
Immediately, Luo Shang and Fei Si began preliminary negotiations.<br/>
<br/>
This news reached Meng Kui's ears and also allowed the current City Lord to breathe a sigh of relief.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, he was stationed at Fire Persimmon Mountain and felt immense pressure.<br/>
<br/>
The terrifying beast tide seemed endless.<br/>
<br/>
The Lava Immortal Palace had already appeared and cultivators were vying for the position of Palace Master, as intensely as fire.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, the discovery of the Void Sect revealed that this evil sect had been scheming for many years.<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit that had ulterior motives...<br/>
<br/>
Dealing with all these variables had already occupied most of his energy and time.<br/>
<br/>
If the Soul Devouring Sect were to stir up additional trouble, the pressure would be immense!<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, others might have forgotten, but Meng Kui would never â€” that Zheng Danlian accidentally killed a Golden Core true disciple of the Great Purity Palace.<br/>
<br/>
The Great Purity Palace would surely come to cause trouble.<br/>
<br/>
But the Great Purity Palace had remained silent.<br/>
<br/>
Did they not want to take action?<br/>
<br/>
Heh, how could that be?<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui didn't need to calculate; just thinking with his brain, he knew the best time for the Great Purity Palace to strike was now!<br/>
<br/>
Because all the major and minor forces were competing around the Lava Immortal Palace. When these forces were exhausted, the sudden intervention of the Great Purity Palace would surely catch others off guard.<br/>
<br/>
The key was that this time, the Great Purity Palace had a justified reason.<br/>
<br/>
Although it wasn't Meng Kui who killed their people, the Zheng family's existence and safety were also partly Meng Kui's responsibility due to their status as a major cultivation family in Fire Persimmon Immortal City.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, this time the City Lord's Mansion lowered its stance and proactively sought cooperation with Luo Shang. Essentially, this was preparation for a rainy day, and also a last resort measure.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui needed to lighten his burden!<br/>
<br/>
Although he was at the Nascent Soul level, facing the Void Sect, Soul Devouring Sect, and Great Purity Palace simultaneously was quite pressuring.<br/>
<br/>
If he could convert some enemies into his own strength, the effect would be significant.<br/>
<br/>
"As for the Lava Immortal Palace and the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit...<br/>
<br/>
"Hmph!"<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui sat deep within the clouds and smoke. There was coldness in his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
He lacked the Mechanism Arts expertise to enter the Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
"But so what?"<br/>
<br/>
"I just need to conserve my strength and maintain the beast tide. The beast tide will continue to damage and erode the Immortal Palace."<br/>
<br/>
"There will be a moment when the mechanisms of the Immortal Palace collapse, allowing me to intervene directly!" Meng Kui never intended to be led by the nose.<br/>
<br/>
To some extent, he allowed the beast tide to damage the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
When the Lava Immortal Palace weakened to a certain extent, he could unleash his Nascent Soul power, interrupt the palace trials, and become the ultimate winner.<br/>
<br/>
He would not act unless he could make a shocking impact!<br/>
<br/>
[...]<br/>
<br/>
Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo held the jade slip "Ice Sculpture Secret Manual" in one hand while looking at the small ice sculpture he had just crafted on the table.<br/>
<br/>
His eyes shone brightly.<br/>
<br/>
"This ice sculpture mechanism book is quite unique."<br/>
<br/>
"The ice sculptures are carved from a massive block of raw material, forming a single entity, rather than being assembled from separate mechanical components."<br/>
<br/>
"To sculpt the desired form, one must master the art of carving, one of the hundred arts of cultivation. It's not just about external carving, internal carving is even more important."<br/>
<br/>
"In a sealed space, one must inscribe all the formations and talismans on the inner walls of the ice sculpture."<br/>
<br/>
"Speaking of which...<br/>
<br/>
"This ice mechanism technique is a perfect match with my Ning Clan's ice attribute talisman crafting!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had been studying the "Ice Sculpture Secret Manual" for some time and had gained considerable insights.<br/>
<br/>
This peculiar mechanism technique greatly broadened his horizons, making him realize that the mechanism techniques he currently mastered were just a small part of a vast world.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, he also sensed Ning Jiufan's clear intention to nurture him through this jade slip.<br/>
<br/>
"This Ning Clan Golden Core ancestor..."<br/>
<br/>
Just as Ning Zhuo was pondering, a message entered his mind â€” the second round of the palace trials had officially begun!<br/>
<br/>
Before Ning Zhuo's eyes, white light burst forth, then expanded into a circle.<br/>
<br/>
The circle quickly grew large enough for Ning Zhuo to step through.<br/>
<br/>
Without hesitation, Ning Zhuo tidied his attire slightly, then stepped forward, disappearing from the room. <br/>
<br/>
In an instant he reappeared in the plaza.<br/>
<br/>
In the main hall plaza of the Lava Immortal Palace, ten arenas had risen.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, along with nineteen other cultivators, appeared directly on the platforms.<br/>
<br/>
In the plaza, only the remaining three cultivators stood with arms crossed, watching.<br/>
<br/>
The scene within the arena was blurry, seemingly preventing spectators from watching.<br/>
<br/>
New information continued to flow into their minds, informing them of more detailed competition rules.<br/>
<br/>
The remaining twenty-three competitors would take turns ascending the platforms for one-on-one matches. The second round of palace trials would end only after everyone had competed against each other.<br/>
<br/>
Each victory would earn a point. A draw would result in zero points, and a loss would result in a negative point.<br/>
<br/>
Each arena match had a time limit.<br/>
<br/>
The arena matches focused on mechanical constructs! <br/>
<br/>
The specific content would change slightly with each round.<br/>
<br/>
Cultivators were not allowed to attack each other's bodies; violators would be disqualified!<br/>
<br/>
Items from the trial stages could be used directly in the second round of palace trials.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the scores would be tallied to form the ranking for the second round of palace trials.<br/>
<br/>
The new ranking list would be adjusted based on the score rankings, and the bottom ten in the final ranking would be eliminated!</div>
