I am an author who outlines my stories.<br/>
<br/>
The first volume has been outlined from the start.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at the big picture, the experiences and relationships between Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong fit better in the latter half of the story.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, when readers encounter Ning Zhuo's seemingly awkward personality in the earlier parts, it's because key information has not been revealed yet.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, the foreshadowing has already been set:<br/>
<br/>
1.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong possesses spiritual eyes, enabling him to see Sun Lie refining pills in the Purple Mansion Courtyard.<br/>
<br/>
2.<br/>
<br/>
After Ning Zhuo seeks his help, Sun Lingtong immediately aids him in framing Han Ming.<br/>
<br/>
3.<br/>
<br/>
The Retired Guest is well-treated in the black market, and when Ning Ze tried to recruit Ning Zhuo, he was framed by Sun Lingtong, resulting in a huge loss of spirit stones.<br/>
<br/>
This was actually Sun Lingtong standing up for Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
4.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong calls the Retired Guest "brother," which is quite uncommon.<br/>
<br/>
These points hint at the close relationship between Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, some readers have noticed this.<br/>
<br/>
Logically analyzing these clues, the answer can indeed be inferred.<br/>
<br/>
If you can deduce it, I think it adds another layer to the reading experience, which feels rewarding.<br/>
<br/>
The outline is set and won't change.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike in "Reverend Insanity," where I altered the plot when readers guessed it, "Mysteries of Immortal Puppet Master" will remain unchanged.<br/>
<br/>
Partly because altering it doesn't necessarily improve the story, and partly because only a few readers can guess the plot.<br/>
<br/>
It's like posing a riddle—if you solve it, you’re clever!<br/>
<br/>
This is just a little game I'm playing with everyone.<br/>
<br/>
This represents a shift in my mindset while writing this book. <br/>
<br/>
At chapter 137, we reach a minor climax, and I hope everyone enjoys it.<br/>
<br/>
Writing about Yuan Dasheng and Yuan Yi is essentially writing about Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
The novel has a relatively complex structure, and I am good at creating such frameworks and planning long-term narratives.<br/>
<br/>
So, the further you read, the more exciting it gets.<br/>
<br/>
This is one of my small specialties in writing.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the recent updates and the difficulties in following the story, I'm thinking about how to improve.<br/>
<br/>
I've already toned things down a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Long-time readers of "Infinite Bloodcore" should understand this.<br/>
<br/>
If the updates were more frequent, this issue wouldn't exist.<br/>
<br/>
But friends, I've been working very hard.<br/>
<br/>
The recent updates have generally exceeded 6000 words.<br/>
<br/>
Don't forget, I'm quite slow at typing! <br/>
<br/>
Those who have been following my work can attest to this.<br/>
<br/>
The current update situation is unprecedented for me, right?<br/>
<br/>
The grand climax of the first volume will be at the end of this month or early next month.<br/>
<br/>
I will adjust the outline structure for the second volume to improve the reading experience.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for your guidance.<br/>
<br/>
If you have good suggestions, you can leave me a message on WeChat.<br/>
<br/>
QQ messages are also fine; I check them periodically.<br/>
<br/>
I may not always reply since there are too many messages, but I will definitely take good suggestions into account.<br/>
<br/>
I used to seclude myself in my inner world, creating behind closed doors, which led to some parts not aligning well with web novel reading habits. <br/>
<br/>
The so-called "coming out of the mountains" actually represents a change in mindset.<br/>
<br/>
During the creation process of "Mysteries of Immortal Puppet Master" I will actively collect opinions and make improvements.<br/>
<br/>
One of the purposes of this "coming out" approach is to improve the reading experience, making the early and middle stages more exciting and engaging.<br/>
<br/>
Combined with my strengths in the later stages, this should help me make further progress.<br/>
<br/>
Improvements in writing style will come last.<br/>
<br/>
I'm rather clumsy and need to take things step by step, slowly.<br/>
<br/>
I place great emphasis on logical consistency in my writing.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the identity of the Shadow Awakened, I've already laid several clues.<br/>
<br/>
Hehe.<br/>
<br/>
If you can guess it, kudos to you!<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, I earnestly ask everyone to subscribe more.<br/>
<br/>
If you're planning to read the book extensively, please consider enabling automatic subscription.<br/>
<br/>
As for monthly tickets, if you find this book to your liking, please consider voting for it.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for your support!<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, there is only one Fang Yuan and only one Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
On this point, I have kept my promise to you all.</div>
