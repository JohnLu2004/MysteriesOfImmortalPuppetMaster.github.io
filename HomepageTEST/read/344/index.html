Going back about an incense stick's worth of time.

The Myriad Li Wandering Dragon, invisible and hidden, arrived at Fog Shrouded Mountain, in front of the Cloud Fox Mountain God Temple.

Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong emerged from the mechanical dragon.

The temple doors were wide open, with worshippers coming and going, mostly villagers.

Seeing the two suddenly appear, the villagers were startled, but then someone recognized them as the guests who had stayed in the village before, and greeted them with a smile.

Sun Lingtong crossed his arms without saying a word.

Ning Zhuo smiled and nodded in greeting to the villagers who greeted them, his attitude very friendly.

The villagers were very enthusiastic: "Have you two guests made up your minds? Coming here to offer incense and pray is absolutely a correct choice. The Fox God is very responsive."

As soon as the two appeared at the temple gate, the Fox God immediately sensed it and her heart skipped a beat.

She had previously informed Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo about the secret of the western valley, intentionally revealing this matter to them. But after waiting for days, there was still no movement, and the Fox God thought they had really left Fog Shrouded Mountain, never to return.

Little did she know that on that day, Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo had deliberately ridden clouds to leave Fog Shrouded Mountain, then activated the Myriad Li Wandering Dragon to secretly infiltrate the western valley.

Although the Fox God was a mountain god, she was only the deputy mountain god, and her true power only reached the Golden Core stage on Fog Shrouded Mountain. She couldn't detect Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo's whereabouts at all.

Now, seeing Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo suddenly return, she immediately sensed that something big was about to happen.

She knew very little, almost nothing, about what had happened these past few days.

So she issued a divine decree.

The fox attendant came running to the door and bowed deeply to Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo: "Honored guests, please come in!"

The worshippers nearby who saw this scene all showed surprised expressions.

They had burned incense and worshipped here many times, but had never seen the usually calm and composed fox attendant show such a humble attitude.

Sun Lingtong shook his head repeatedly: "We won't go in. Ask your master to come to the mountainside for a talk."

The last time they were trapped in the temple, they had suffered a small setback.

How could they make the same mistake again?

This time, Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo no longer concealed their tracks, secretly letting the still undetectable Myriad Li Wandering Dragon follow. The two of them took out somersault clouds and rode them down the mountain.

As they descended to the mountainside, they saw a burst of mountain fog suddenly appear, then condense into the Fox God.

Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo dismounted from their clouds. The silver-haired, white-robed, graceful Fox God was already standing on the ground, looking at the two with a smile.

Sun Lingtong lightly jumped down, his feet landing on the ground.

Ning Zhuo lowered his cloud to near ground level, stretched his legs, and put away the cloud. The cloud dispersed into mist that drifted into his storage belt, and he stood tall in front of the Fox God.

His first words were: "Fox God, your secret is out!"

The Fox God's pupils contracted slightly, but her smiling expression remained composed: "It's been many days since I've seen you, young master. This god has missed you greatly. I didn't expect that the first words upon our reunion would be this. It's too hurtful to one's feelings."

Ning Zhuo laughed coldly: "I have thoroughly investigated the case of the Black Wind Tiger Demon in the western valley."

"The Meng family Golden Core cultivator from Jade Steel Town has been secretly assisting this demonic monster, and is now panicking."

"As for you, being a mountain god, you clearly knew but didn't report or expose this, failing in your duty as an official of the Southern Bean Kingdom. Harboring a demonic monster and helping it wreak havoc in the area, your crime is very serious, Fox God."

The Fox God's expression changed, involuntarily revealing a trace of panic.

"Young master is indeed formidable!"

"In just a few short days, you've uncovered the truth."

"This servant was also forced, if I hadn't complied, I would have died long ago. How could I have met you, young master?"

"Forced by circumstances, this servant could only submit and serve the villains, but my loyal heart is known to heaven and earth! This servant has always been plotting to expose this conspiracy."

"So, after meeting you, young master, I immediately informed you two."

"This should be enough to prove this servant's sincerity."

Sun Lingtong sneered: "Well, Fox God, your eloquence is indeed impressive. You informed us about the secret of the western valley, intending to trick us into exploring it."

"If we weren't powerful enough, we would have become food for the demonic monster. I suppose you've done this before, haven't you?"

"If we were evenly matched, causing a commotion, you could stand by and watch, letting the secret be exposed, making it impossible for the demonic monster to stay on Fog Shrouded Mountain, clearing away your troubles."

"If we were more powerful, or simply brought help to kill the demonic monster, you would effortlessly enjoy the fruits of victory. After all, with the official Mountain God gone, you, the deputy, could naturally be promoted."

Sun Lingtong directly exposed the Fox God's calculations.

The Fox God forced a smile: "Little boy, you think too poorly of this servant."

She was about to continue explaining when Ning Zhuo raised his hand to interrupt: "Alright, let's save the probing and acting. We can protect you, but Fox God, what can you offer in return?"

The Fox God was slightly stunned, then showed a joyful expression and tentatively said: "This servant is willing to offer ten thousand mid-grade spirit stones."

Spirit stones were divided into low-grade, mid-grade, high-grade, and supreme grade.

A thousand low-grade spirit stones can be roughly exchanged for a hundred mid-grade spirit stones, or ten high-grade spirit stones.

This exchange rate is just a general market price reference.

In reality, most cultivators, under the same conditions, preferred quality over quantity. Between ten high-grade spirit stones and a hundred mid-grade spirit stones, basically no cultivator would choose the latter.

As for supreme-grade spirit stones, they were priceless and not available on the market, so the exchange rates of the lower grades couldn’t be used as reference.

Ten thousand mid-grade spirit stones was a huge fortune.

But Sun Lingtong immediately shook his head: "Is this a joke? Are you trying to shoo beggars away?”

The Fox God said: "This servant hasn't finished speaking, little boy, don't be impatient."

She looked at Ning Zhuo, her beautiful eyes flashing: "This servant is also willing to offer six Golden Core level mountain essences."

Mountain essence was a specialty of great mountains, a type of stone essence.

It was small in size, resembling a walnut pit, but with a heavy base that could carry a large number of formation patterns. It was perfect for using as a formation base.

The Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng had many mountain essences inside its body. However, they were all at the Foundation Establishment level.

If upgraded to Golden Core level mountain essences, the number and scale of formations it could carry would increase more than tenfold!

Ning Zhuo was tempted, but his expression remained unchanged.

Sun Lingtong, in perfect coordination with him, immediately said: "Fox God, you should know that we come from extraordinary backgrounds, from wealthy families. A mere six mountain essences is really underestimating us."

The smile on the Fox God's face faded as she took a light breath: "This servant is also willing to offer three hundred mist rust orchids, one hundred and eighty hazy fog stones, and sixty drops of purple qi morning dew."

Mist rust orchid was a white orchid that only grew in environments with dense clouds and mist. It was often used to make disguise talismans or pills for concealing one's aura.

Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu had previously stolen many from inside the cloud whale.

Hazy fog stones only appeared in areas of dense fog that never dispersed. Crushing one could release a vast fog that covered several miles.

Purple qi morning dew was essentially just morning dew, but its value lay in the fact that it contained purple qi.

Many cultivators' cultivation methods involve absorbing the strands of purple qi that the sun cast upon the vast sky and earth at dawn when it rises.

Countless dewdrops formed in the mountains every morning, and some could absorb a bit of purple qi. When the temperature rose and the dew evaporated, the purple qi would naturally disperse back into the world.

Mountain gods like the Fox God had an extraordinary advantage in collecting this sort of morning dew.

Although the quality of these dewdrops was only at the Qi Refining stage, the purple qi is useful for both Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong, making them quite valuable.

But Sun Lingtong still shook his head: "Not enough, not enough!"

The Fox God glared, her expression turning cold: "Little boy, your appetite is truly big. Can you digest so much?"

Sun Lingtong snorted coldly: "You'd better worry about yourself."

The Fox God gritted her teeth and had to raise the stakes again: "Thirteen stalks of ghost shadow bamboo, each at the Foundation Establishment level. This is all of my precious collection, surely that's enough?"

Sun Lingtong couldn't help but raise his eyebrows.

Having managed the black market for many years, she naturally knew very well the relative value of goods.

Ghost shadow bamboo was quite rare, only growing in very gloomy places. Such places were often haunted by vast numbers of ghosts, making them extremely dangerous.

A stalk of ghost shadow bamboo could harbor ghosts inside of it. When it was swung, the bamboo shadows were like ghosts, floating off the ground, and claiming the lives of enemies.

Moreover, ghost shadow bamboo contained enormous amounts of yin energy, which for some cultivators was an extremely valuable cultivation resource.

If a cultivator wanted to enter the Ghost Market, a ghost shadow lantern made from ghost shadow bamboo was one of the best treasures for leading the way.

In short, because ghost shadow bamboo was so rare, it often only appeared at auctions. Any single stalk, as long as its condition wasn't too poor, could sell for the price of a Golden Core level material.

This time, the Fox God wasn't offering just one stalk, but as many as thirteen. For a newly appointed mountain god, this was truly bringing out her life savings. Even Sun Lingtong found it unbelievable – how could the Fox God have so many? Was being the Fog Shrouded Mountain God so profitable?

"According to common sense, Fog Shrouded Mountain shouldn't be a place that produces ghost shadow bamboo," Sun Lingtong felt puzzled and simply asked directly.

The Fox God smiled bitterly and said: "That demonic black tiger has the innate talent of Night Shadow Yin Evil. It slaughtered many living beings, all concentrated in the western valley. Therefore, ghost shadow bamboo can occasionally be produced there."

"Young masters, this servant has only been a god for a short time. I've already brought out my entire fortune to buy my life and atone for my sins."

"I hope the two of you can take pity on this small god..."

The Fox God was on the verge of tears.

Sun Lingtong sneered. He was much more experienced than Ning Zhuo in this kind of extortion: "Hmph, Fox God, you can't fool me. These aren't your most prized possessions. I can tell at a glance!"

"You need to understand, we're taking your things to help you."

"What we get is only a small part. To hekp atone for your sins, we need to grease all the right palms."

"At this point, if you're still clinging to some property, it's truly unwise."

"When the time comes and your mountain is felled, your temple destroyed, your body dispersed, and your spirit annihilated, what use will those treasures be to you?"</div>
