<div id="chapterContent">As the governor of Floating Magnetic Immortal City, his jurisdiction was not limited to the Immortal City, but also included surrounding villages and towns, as well as various sects and families.<br/>
Cloud Concealment Mountain was naturally within his jurisdiction.<br/>
Although he was a Nascent Soul cultivator and a Governor ruling over a region, he could barely be considered a half-frontier official. But facing Meng Zizhong, who was at the Golden Core level, he felt quite thorny.<br/>
In this world, one must pay attention to background and power.<br/>
This point was more prominent in the righteous path than in the demonic path.<br/>
It would be very easy to take down Meng Zizhong; the Governor could do it quite easily. He wouldn't need to act personally; with one order, he could make Meng Zizhong submit.<br/>
The difficulty lay in Meng Zizhong's background.<br/>
The Meng family!<br/>
This was one of the great clans of the Southern Bean Country, one of the founding meritorious officials.<br/>
The Governor came from a scattered cultivation background. Although he had a family, they provided little help. In reality, he had relied on his own strength to nourish his family.<br/>
He knew well that even the Zhu royal family would be cautious when dealing with important ministers like the Meng family, requiring careful methods and timing. What more of him?<br/>
"You want to report Meng Zizhong for maintaining private troops? This evidence alone is not enough." The Governor shook his head, showing obvious intent to shirk responsibility.<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled: "Governor, I understand your difficulties. Don't worry, I'm not here to trouble you."<br/>
"You only need to report this up. I believe the Zhu royal family will react immediately. At that time, you only need to follow orders."<br/>
"Of course, I could directly send a message to Lord Zhu Xuanji. However, after thinking about it, I felt that reporting over levels would seem like disregarding the governor's authority. You should know that although I'm young, I'm still the clan leader of a branch of the Ning family. Naturally, I should set an example and follow the rules."<br/>
The Floating Magnetic Governor’s eye twitched, inwardly grumbling: "This little brat, why didn’t you just report it to the higher ups! If I didn't see or hear about this, wouldn't I be free from this awkward situation?"<br/>
The governor's heart was full of helplessness.<br/>
From this simple exchange, he already knew that Ning Zhuo was not to be trifled with! This young man was very familiar with the rules of the righteous path. He should be treated as an equal opponent to be safe.<br/>
"Wait a moment, I'll go report this now." The Floating Magnetic Governor left Ning Zhuo at the door, turned back to his study, and used the emergency channel to report this case.<br/>
Ning Zhuo stood outside the study, not moving around aimlessly, standing still without any uneasiness, calm and composed. From the beginning, he knew that the Floating Magnetic Governor couldn't make decisions and couldn't be relied upon.<br/>
He came here only to use this Nascent Soul cultivator as a messenger.<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s real reliance was on the royal Zhu family!<br/>
Of course, even if the Floating Magnetic Governor was only passing on a message, he would inevitably be involved. He really didn't want to wade into these muddy waters, but he had no choice. It was truly a case of trouble coming to find him while he was sitting at home.<br/>
In recent years, the Zhu family had found it increasingly difficult to control the Southern Bean Country.<br/>
The monarch had carefully selected the Floating Magnetic Governor, supporting him to preside over Floating Magnet Immortal City, which hadn’t been easy. It was the result of frequent confrontations with various important ministers in the court, forming alliances, and barely grasping an opportunity.<br/>
The Floating Magnetic Governor was a capable local agent for the Zhu family's control. At this moment, he suddenly used the emergency contact channel to convey a key case, which immediately got the monarch's attention.<br/>
Meng Zizhong's matter seemed small, but it actually involved the game between the Meng family and the Zhu family.<br/>
"It's this Ning Zhuo again?" The monarch sighed, "As expected of a child of destiny, wherever he goes, waves are bound to rise."<br/>
The monarch frowned, not very willing to deal with this matter, and feeling quite helpless.<br/>
Because if not handled properly, the Zhu family would have to clash fiercely with the Meng family. As the royal family, the Zhu family's strength was certainly stronger than the Meng family, but the entire Southern Bean Country didn't just have the Meng family, there was also the Su family, and other important ministers and generals.<br/>
If the Zhu family consumed too much strength on the Meng family, exposing signs of weakness, there would be even greater risks. As the monarch of a country, he naturally had to assess the situation and couldn't ignore any risks.<br/>
"The Floating Magnetic Governor can't be used." The Southern Bean monarch first confirmed this point.<br/>
He wanted to protect this rare local talent, and so he couldn’t easily let him get involved in the confrontation between the royal family and the Meng family. Therefore, the Southern Bean monarch needed to find someone who could be trusted and could withstand possible retaliation from the Meng family.<br/>
Soon, the Southern Bean monarch thought of a candidate.<br/>
Zhu Xuanji was speeding through the air.<br/>
He was like a golden rainbow, piercing through the sky.<br/>
"In another half day, I'll reach Qi Men Immortal City. By transferring through it, I can greatly shorten the journey and quickly return to the capital."<br/>
Just as he was thinking this, Zhu Xuanji's expression suddenly changed slightly, and the token in his bosom trembled lightly.<br/>
He was not far from Qi Men Immortal City, so he received the royal urgent order transmitted from the location of the immortal city.<br/>
"Asking me to go to Floating Magnet Immortal City to handle urgent matters?"<br/>
He looked carefully, and his face immediately darkened.<br/>
Because he saw a name he didn't want to see.<br/>
"What is this kid stirring up in Floating Magnet Immortal City?"<br/>
"Black Wind Tiger Demon, Meng Zizhong..."<br/>
Zhu Xuanji showed a surprised expression, understanding the royal family's intention to have him change course midway.<br/>
He sighed and continued forward - with the help of Qi Men Immortal City, he could teleport long distances and directly arrive at Floating Magnet Immortal City.<br/>
That evening, Zhu Xuanji met Ning Zhuo again in the Floating Magnetic Governor's office, along with Sun Lingtong.<br/>
After reviewing that image, Zhu Xuanji said directly: "This bit of evidence can't prove that Meng Zizhong has private connections with the Black Wind Tiger Demon. He can completely claim that he sensed killing intent from that cultivator Shi Sui, so he struck first."<br/>
"Besides this, there are various excuses, no matter how absurd, that he can use."<br/>
Sun Lingtong: "With the Divine Constable's intervention, tracing the source and under his golden eyes, are we still worried about not finding his crimes and handles?"<br/>
Zhu Xuanji frowned without speaking.<br/>
The Floating Magnetic Governor shook his head slightly: "The trouble with this matter lies in finding the evidence!"<br/>
"Maintaining bandits for self-importance is a great crime. Especially since it involves the death of the previous town chief, this is murdering a government official, completely crossing the bottom line."<br/>
"Before we are fully prepared to completely confront the Meng family, we can't rashly launch such an attack."<br/>
"For such a serious crime, the Meng family can't possibly admit guilt directly. Because the crime is too great, once they truly admit it, the loss the Meng family will bear will be extremely severe."<br/>
"And once the crime is proclaimed, the Zhu family will also be in a dilemma. Not bringing the criminal to justice will completely expose the weakness of the royal Zhu family, making the disloyal hearts of various great families and clans even stronger!"<br/>
"At that time, the situation will evolve into a full-scale confrontation between the Zhu family and the Meng family. Even if the Zhu family wins, they will likely be greatly weakened. And the process of intense struggle will allow other great families and clans to benefit from it."<br/>
Ning Zhuo smiled, having expected this: "My Ning family is aligned with the Zhu family. If the Zhu family and Meng family engage in a big fight, we will be the first to suffer."<br/>
"After all, Meng Zizhong is still the current City Lord."<br/>
"This time in dealing with Meng Zizhong, there's no need to involve his great crime of maintaining bandits for self-importance. Bringing him down and letting our people control Yu Gang Mountain will be enough."<br/>
"Meng Zizhong is still under your jurisdiction at this time, Governor. This is a hidden danger. Bringing him down would be beneficial for you, Governor, and for the royal Zhu family, wouldn't it?"<br/>
This hit right at the heart of what the Floating Magnetic Governor was thinking, making him take a deep look at Ning Zhuo, his evaluation of him rising once again.<br/>
Zhu Xuanji snorted coldly, pointing at Ning Zhuo: "I knew you already had a plan, just say it straight out."<br/>
Ning Zhuo then explained his plan.<br/>
The three cultivators listened carefully, with Sun Lingtong exclaiming it was a good strategy, and Zhu Xuanji nodding slightly.<br/>
The Floating Magnetic Governor looked at Ning Zhuo again. It had to be said that the young man before him had left a deep impression.<br/>
This plan seemed simple, but the grasp and understanding of human nature had reached an exquisite level.<br/>
Normally, at sixteen or seventeen years old, one should be in a phase of naive romanticism, easily moved and impulsive. But the youth before him seemed like someone who had experienced the world deeply, gone through the ups and downs of officialdom, experienced the intricacies of human hearts, with a weathered body and mind, and unfathomable depths.<br/>
"He still has an untested talent... his future will most certainly be bright." Realizing this point, the Floating Magnetic Governor couldn't help but feel some closeness to Ning Zhuo’s.<br/>
After the discussion was settled, the four people began to act.<br/>
A few days later, when Meng Zizhong saw the intelligence in his hand, he couldn't help but fly into a rage: "Investigate, investigate for me, who exactly is spreading these rumors!"<br/>
A rumor had recently been circulating, pointing directly at Meng Zizhong, saying that he had secretly funded the Black Wind Tiger Demon and was the true culprit behind the death of the previous town chief. Meng Zizhong had ambitions of maintaining bandits for self-importance and plotting against the state!<br/>
However, strict prohibitions and investigations had no effect, instead making the rumors spread more fiercely, with many versions evolving.<br/>
One of the rumors even revealed the hiding place of the Black Wind Tiger Demon - Cloud Concealment Mountain, making Meng Zizhong panic.<br/>
He didn't dare to be careless and sent a message back to the Meng family, only mentioning the current state of rumors in Yu Gang Town.<br/>
The Meng family immediately became alert, knowing that someone must be stirring up trouble behind the scenes. Unable to investigate anything, to avoid letting things drag on and potentially having real evidence exposed, they decisively chose to sacrifice the pawn to protect the king!<br/>
Meng Zizhong entered the military camp and began to deploy troops, actively preparing for war.<br/>
Standing on the platform for reviewing troops, Meng Zizhong shouted loudly: "Since this general was entrusted with this dangerous mission and stationed here, I have always been cautious and diligent, training troops and sharpening weapons."<br/>
"This general has continuously sent out reconnaissance, and recently finally had some gains, discovering the hiding place of that Black Wind Tiger Demon. However, demon spies in the town have been stirring up trouble, spreading rumors, attempting to incite internal strife to delay our army's time of attack, buying time for the demon to relocate."<br/>
"Hmph! How could this general easily fall for such tricks? This time, I will personally lead the army, avenge you all, bravely kill the enemy, sweep away all demons, and restore clear skies to our Yu Gang Town!"<br/>
"Warriors, follow me to charge into battle, kill all demons, and create a prosperous and peaceful world together!"<br/>
The stationed troops responded in unison, their morale fully aroused.<br/>
They immediately set out, arranged in neat formation, and entered the teleportation array.<br/>
The teleportation array was frequently activated, directly teleporting the town's troops to the vicinity of Mist Concealment Mountain.<br/>
This commotion finally couldn't be concealed and was detected by the Black Wind Tiger Demon's group.<br/>
The Tiger Demon's eyes turned blood-red, falling into a rage, letting out a roar, and leading a group of demon cultivators, rushing out of the valley directly towards the army.<br/>
