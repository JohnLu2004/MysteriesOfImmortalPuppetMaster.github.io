The items were already in hand, and the True Inheritor of the Great Purity Palace had no intention of lingering any longer.

He immediately wanted to retreat and escape from Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

But in the next moment, Zheng Shuangjun descended from the sky, unleashing a torrent of blade qi, slashing fiercely at the True Inheritor of the Great Purity Palace.

Zhou Nongying emerged from the ground, raising a wave of dark shadows that completely cut off the True Inheritor's escape route.

Zheng Danlian, from his left side, drew his bow and nocked an arrow.

The arrow shot through the air, firmly locking onto the True Inheritor's forehead.

At this moment, a Golden Core Stage disciple of the Purple Dawn Pavilion also appeared, pushing both palms forward.

His spell, like a burst of brilliant fireworks, burned towards the True Inheritor.

It is worth mentioning that the Golden Core Stage disciple of the Purple Dawn Pavilion was also clad in black attire, identical to that of the Shadow Demon Cultivators.

"A third Shadow Demon Cultivator?!" Everyone was shocked in an instant.

The True Inheritor of the Great Purity Palace wanted to flee, but enemies surrounded him on all sides.

He narrowly dodged Zheng Shuangjun's attack and broke free from Zhou Nongying's shadow entanglement, but he couldn't avoid Zheng Danlian's arrow.

He took the arrow head-on and had to use his back to block the brilliant fireworks from the Purple Dawn Pavilion's True Inheritor.

The numerous defensive magical artifacts he had activated with all his might shattered two of them directly.

Only the innermost layer of his undergarments, which were of magical artifact level, stubbornly protected his vital areas.

The True Inheritor of the Great Purity Palace still wanted to persist, spitting blood while gritting his teeth, carrying the Demonic Dao Scripture, and continuing to flee for several hundred meters.

However, the attacks from all sides were relentless.

With his fists unable to fend off four hands, he had no choice but to throw the Demonic Dao Scripture away again to alleviate the pressure on himself.

The Golden Core Stage cultivators who had been besieging the True Inheritor of the Great Purity Palace immediately ceased their attacks.

They were worried that the text of the scripture would be destroyed.

Although the scripture could be circulated, under such destructive circumstances, the circulated scripture would also suffer content loss.

The Golden Core Stage cultivators restrained their attacks and then reached out again to grab the scripture.

The scene was chaotic.

Golden and silver lights collided, blades and hooks danced wildly, and spells flew everywhere.

Sun Lingtong plunged into this chaotic battle, and the situation became even more chaotic with the immediate involvement of Chi Han, who followed closely behind him.

Sun Lingtong, with his agile movements, took the opportunity to escape.

"Exciting, so exciting!" His big eyes sparkled, his spirit highly focused, and his face flushed with excitement.

He was both scared and thrilled, thoroughly enjoying this adventure.

If they were outside the city, someone like Sun Lingtong, who was only at the Foundation Establishment Stage, wouldn't stand a chance.

But within the city, with the Immortal City Grand Formation providing full suppression, the power of the Golden Core Stage cultivators was greatly restricted.

Moreover, Sun Lingtong had made ample preparations in advance, expending his foundation to sustain his performance.

He was not an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator, barely maintaining his disguise.

The battlefield was chaotic, with various factions and many with ulterior motives, making the attacks and defenses switch rapidly.

Sun Lingtong did not face a Golden Core Stage opponent directly.

Even among the Golden Core Stage cultivators, they were seriously entangled with each other.

Chi Han shouted, "Shadow Demon Cultivator, where are you running?!"

Then, he saw the Shadow Demon Cultivator, a True Inheritor of the Purple Dawn Pavilion.

This Golden Core Stage True Inheritor was the closest to him, so Chi Han didn't hesitate and threw a punch.

The Golden Core Stage cultivator of the Purple Dawn Pavilion activated his defensive spell, but it was greatly suppressed by the formation.

Bang.

Chi Han's punch directly sent the Golden Core Stage cultivator of the Purple Dawn Pavilion crashing into the ground.

In such a battlefield, the advantage of body cultivators was evident from this punch!

The two Golden Core Stage True Inheritors disguised as Shadow Demon Cultivators were in a difficult situation.

They were adept at using spells, but their spells were heavily suppressed, forcing them to rely on less commonly used magical artifacts to hold their ground.

Because of their disguise, they couldn't use their usual methods.

Taking advantage of Chi Han being drawn away, Sun Lingtong, with a sense of gratitude towards the True Inheritor of the Purple Dawn Pavilion, burrowed underground, swiftly escaping through the gaps in the Immortal City Grand Formation via the sewers, completing his retreat without incident.

The Shadow Demon Cultivator, a True Inheritor of the Great Purity Palace, once again charged towards the Demonic Dao Scripture, his face full of excitement, "It's still mine!" But in the next moment, a ghost general suddenly appeared, blocking him.

Another ghost general immediately followed, grabbing the Demonic Dao Scripture and running towards its master—Luo Shang!

Luo Shang reappeared.

But he revealed his true face, not disguised as a Shadow Demon Cultivator.

Luo Shang's face was still somewhat swollen, indicating that the residual poison in his body had not been cleared.

The ghost general that snatched the Demonic Dao Scripture was evidently extremely fast, covering several hundred steps in the blink of an eye, arriving in front of Luo Shang and presenting the scripture.

The moment Luo Shang received it, he felt the profound meaning of the scripture.

"Demonic Blood Vein Technique?!" Luo Shang showed a hint of joy, just about to speak when golden light suddenly flashed before his eyes.

Zhu Xuanji pounced in front of him, holding a large ruler, slashing down fiercely like wielding a sword.

Luo Shang hurriedly controlled a third Golden Core Stage ghost general to block Zhu Xuanji, while he took the opportunity to retreat.

"You can leave, but the scripture stays!" Ning Jiufan suddenly revealed himself, holding an Ice Jade Pot, casting an ice spell that directly froze Luo Shang.

But the frozen Luo Shang quickly changed his appearance, revealing his true form—a strange ghost general with a skeletal face, still at the Golden Core Stage.

The real Luo Shang was still hiding his true body.

The ghost general was frozen, and the Demonic Dao Scripture suffered the same fate.

Ning Jiufan reached into the giant ice block.

Where his hand passed, the diamond-hard ice flowed like water.

Ning Jiufan obtained the Demonic Dao Scripture, his expression changing as he was also fooled.

But in the next moment, Luo Shang's counterattack arrived.

Four Golden Core Stage ghost generals surrounded Ning Jiufan, launching a frenzied assault.

Ning Jiufan, with formidable combat power, still managed to fend off the attacks, albeit in a rather disheveled state.

Luo Shang's true strength was revealed at this moment.

He came from the Soul Devouring Sect, specializing in controlling ghostly entities.

Under his command, there were many ghost generals with Golden Core Stage combat power.

He alone was equivalent to a small sect.

Ning Jiufan's situation immediately improved, thanks to the assistance of another Golden Core Stage ancestor from the Zhou family.

The latter threw a formation disk from afar.

The formation disk, at the level of a magical artifact, spun above Ning Jiufan's head, instantly setting up a formation that caused the ghost generals to lose their direction and make frequent mistakes.

Ning Jiufan, while receiving the infusion of the scripture's profound meaning, left the formation disk behind and quickly escaped the formation.

"Support him!" Zheng Shuangjun shouted.

At this point in the battle, the combined advantage of the three cultivation families and Zhu Xuanji finally became apparent.

Yang Chanyu, holding a mechanical bow, shot arrows that strongly interfered with Ning Jiufan.

The two Shadow Demon Cultivators, seeing the urgent situation, only exchanged a glance before immediately attacking Ning Jiufan with all their might.

Ning Jiufan displayed strong combat power, with ice spreading everywhere, holding on for quite a while.

But in the end, he was struck by a flying dart from the True Inheritor of the Great Purity Palace, breaking through his defense.

If Ning Jiufan hadn't tilted his head in time, the dart, which only grazed his left ear, would have seriously injured him!

Ning Jiufan couldn't hold on any longer and threw the Demonic Dao Scripture to Zheng Shuangjun.

Why make such a choice?

Ning Jiufan's reason was very simple—Zheng Shuangjun was the closest ally to him at that moment.

"You go, I'll hold them off!" Zheng Danlian ran to the back of his clan's Golden Core Stage cultivator, blocking the enemies.

Zheng Shuangjun also shouted, "Protect me, once we enter the clan territory, we'll be safe. The scripture's content will be shared with you all!" The profound meaning of the Demonic Dao Scripture gradually flowed into his heart, giving him extra motivation to protect the treasure.

The two Golden Core Stage cultivators of the Zhou family exchanged a glance and attacked with all their might.

Ning Jiufan also frequently cast spells with his palms, intercepting other cultivators.

Indeed, the three Golden Core Stage cultivators had the numerical advantage, as this was their territory.

Seeing the scripture about to be taken away and being blocked themselves, someone became anxious.

The True Inheritor of the Purple Dawn Pavilion formed hand seals, and lightning appeared in his palms.

The purple lightning was incredibly fast, leaving only an afterimage in the eyes of the Golden Core Stage cultivators.

Before anyone could react, it accurately struck Zheng Shuangjun's back.

Zheng Shuangjun spat out a mouthful of blood, stumbling forward, almost falling but managing to stabilize himself and continue running.

The True Inheritor of the Great Purity Palace snorted coldly, chanting incantations.

The wind roared around him, forming a phantom of a green dragon.

The dragon's roar echoed, and the green dragon phantom flew out, carrying a strong impact and tearing force.

Wherever it went, the green wind was like a blade, with the power to tear everything apart!

So fierce that the Zhou family's Golden Core Stage cultivators didn't dare to confront it head-on and actively avoided it.

Seeing the green dragon phantom about to hit Zheng Shuangjun, at the critical moment, his own Golden Core Stage cultivator was reliable.

Zheng Danlian blocked in front of the green dragon, wiping the surface of his storage belt at his waist.

Hiss!

A mechanical black snake appeared, much smaller in size compared to the green dragon phantom.

But even so, the mechanical black snake was fearless, raising its head to collide.

The green dragon phantom collapsed, and the green wind quickly dispersed and disappeared.

The True Inheritor of the Great Purity Palace's face changed dramatically.

He was well aware of the power of his move, but at this moment, it was shattered by an ordinary-looking mechanical black snake.

The mechanical black snake, gaining momentum, continued its attack.

The True Inheritor of the Great Purity Palace threw out a magical artifact, a set of bamboo flying swords, totaling forty-nine.

The bamboo flying swords, like a torrential downpour, clanged as they pierced the mechanical black snake.

The mechanical black snake's momentum slowed slightly, but its ferocity remained, unstoppable, charging towards the True Inheritor.

The True Inheritor felt a strong sense of crisis, hurriedly activating a protective magical artifact.

The black snake opened its mouth and bit, directly breaking through the protective light and biting off the True Inheritor's left arm.

The True Inheritor of the Great Purity Palace screamed in pain, retreating rapidly, and began to treat his severed arm.

However, the wound was constantly surrounded by black qi, hindering his healing methods.

The True Inheritor's face changed dramatically, exclaiming, "Night Rain Demon Weapon?!"

Everyone was shocked.

The mechanical black snake rampaged, invincible for a time.

Various spells hit it, as light as the wind.

Even magical artifacts were broken or bitten by the black snake.

"This demon weapon is so ferocious!" Everyone was extremely astonished.

Luo Shang, unwilling to accept this, sent ghost generals to attack the mechanical black snake.

As a result, out of the four Golden Core Stage ghost generals, only two returned when Luo Shang urgently recalled them.

Even though ghost generals' overall combat power often couldn't compare to cultivators of the same level, the mechanical black snake's power was still too overwhelming.</div>
