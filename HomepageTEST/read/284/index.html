<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
After the first round of the imperial examination, the ranking list was reduced to twenty-three names. <br/>
<br/>
The rankings had undergone significant changes. Previously, Golden Core cultivators dominated the top half of the list, but now cultivators of various stages — Qi Refining, Foundation Establishment, and Golden Core — were intermixed chaotically. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, Golden Core cultivators still made up the majority, occupying more than half of the list. It seemed that Golden Core cultivators were the main characters of the examination, while the Foundation Establishment and Qi Refining cultivators were merely the secondary characters.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's eyes flashed with a sharp light; he saw hope in removing the surveillance methods placed on him. <br/>
<br/>
At this moment, a new piece of information was conveyed. It was an introduction to the second round of the imperial examination. Simply put, the second round would take the form of a ranking competition, allowing each cultivator to engage in a relatively fair match with one another.<br/>
<br/>
After this information was conveyed, the ground of the plaza in front of the hall began to tremble. Subsequently, the floor tiles rearranged themselves, swallowing the desks and then spitting out ten circular arenas. Once these arenas were fully revealed, the tiles closed back up, forming a neat and tidy surface. <br/>
<br/>
Transmission circles appeared beside everyone once again. Many cultivators stepped quickly into the circles, seizing every second to prepare for the upcoming second round of the examination. Some cultivators who had fallen off the list lingered, unable to move, and were forcibly teleported away by the expanding transmission circles.<br/>
<br/>
After stepping out of the transmission circle, Ning Zhuo returned to his temporary residence. He hurriedly left his room and entered the neighboring one to pay respects to Ning Jiufan. <br/>
<br/>
"Old Ancestor," Ning Zhuo said, "the second round of the examination is coming up, and the competition will surely be even fiercer! I have hidden dangers on me and fear I might be harmed in secret." <br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan stroked his beard, understanding what Ning Zhuo was referring to. Ning Zhuo was talking about the various surveillance methods planted on him by the Golden Core cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo told Ning Jiufan that he once considered these surveillance methods as his protective talismans. Now, with the situation having changed so drastically, could these surveillance methods be controlled or influenced by others? If there were indeed means of control or influence, it would be extremely disadvantageous for Ning Zhuo, who was about to step onto the arena.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan said, "I will try to remove these methods for you." Ning Zhuo replied, "No need to trouble you, Old Ancestor. The second round of the examination is imminent, and you are our Ning family's greatest hope! I believe it is reasonable for our Ning family to obtain the Lava Immortal Palace!" <br/>
<br/>
"My idea is to seek help from Lord Zhu Xuanji, to have him exert pressure and remove all the surveillance methods on me." <br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan nodded slightly, "That's indeed a good idea. I will write a letter to inquire about Lord Zhu's intentions."<br/>
<br/>
While Ning Jiufan was writing the letter, Zhu Xuanji was also writing a letter. He wanted to send it to Meng Kui! In the letter, Zhu Xuanji recorded fragments related to the Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique, Demonic Blood Vein Technique, and Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique from the examination questions. He wanted to ask Meng Kui to calculate the relationship between these three techniques and whether they were part of the three sects' superior techniques. <br/>
<br/>
"I hope to receive a reply soon."<br/>
<br/>
Zhu Xuanji looked at the breach in the light barrier and the Scarlet Flame Beasts continuously charging in, sighing deeply. <br/>
<br/>
With the withdrawal of the Nascent Soul-level Fire Snake, the Scarlet Flame Beast tide had become even larger and more threatening than before. Especially recently, due to the secret efforts of the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, breaches had appeared in the light barrier, allowing Scarlet Flame Beasts to break in continuously. This made the difficulty of entering the palace significantly reduced compared to before. Such changes greatly stimulated the Scarlet Flame Beasts, making their attacks even more violent and rampant.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, it became more inconvenient for cultivators to enter and exit the Lava Immortal Palace. In the past, Zhu Xuanji might have acted personally, as it wasn't far, to meet Meng Kui and urge him to calculate in his presence. Now, Zhu Xuanji preferred to send a flying message. After all, he needed a lot of time to properly prepare for the second round of the examination!<br/>
<br/>
"According to the previous information, the second round of the examination is an individual battle." <br/>
<br/>
"The so-called relative fairness, does it mean that those with higher cultivation will be suppressed by the Immortal Palace — suppressed to the same actual performance as those with lower cultivation?" <br/>
<br/>
"After all, the ranking list includes Golden Core cultivators, Foundation Establishment cultivators, and Qi Refining cultivators." <br/>
<br/>
"The examination stipulates that only methods related to mechanical constructs are allowed. This description is quite vague." <br/>
<br/>
"If I have a large number of mechanical puppets, can I use them directly in the arena?" <br/>
<br/>
"If these mechanical puppets have Golden Core-level combat power, what then?"<br/>
<br/>
While Zhu Xuanji was pondering, Ning Jiufan's letter flew to him. He opened it and saw it was about Ning Zhuo. The concerns expressed by Ning Jiufan were acknowledged by Zhu Xuanji. The divine constable thought for a moment; Ning Zhuo's matter was small but highlighted the significant internal issues within the three-family alliance. <br/>
<br/>
As the competition intensified, the once united three major cultivation families would also fracture, thinking and acting for their own interests. This was clearly not what Zhu Xuanji wanted to see. He immediately decided to use Ning Zhuo's request to invite the Golden Core cultivators of the three families to discuss important matters and strengthen the alliance!<br/>
<br/>
Moments later, the Golden Core cultivators of the three families gathered around Ning Zhuo, successively removing the surveillance methods they had placed on him. <br/>
<br/>
Throughout this process, Zhu Xuanji activated his Heaven-Piercing Eyes to observe. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Jiufan breathed a sigh of relief. If he had relied solely on himself to resolve these surveillance methods, he might not have succeeded, and it would have been time-consuming and labor-intensive. Now, having the Golden Core cultivators remove them personally was the best outcome.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, at Ning Zhuo's request, only the surveillance methods of Ning Jiufan and Zhu Xuanji were retained on him. <br/>
<br/>
Zheng Shuangjun suddenly proposed a transaction to Ning Zhuo. He wanted to purchase the mechanical ape in Ning Zhuo's possession. Not the fire ape, but the Golden Core-level one that Ning Zhuo had orchestrated and prepared for a long time. <br/>
<br/>
Naturally, Ning Zhuo was unwilling and claimed it was not yet completed. Zhu Xuanji, standing by, immediately saw through his lie. <br/>
<br/>
Zheng Shuangjun was unfazed, "Even if it's not fully constructed, it doesn't matter. My Zheng family is willing to purchase it at a high price, even if it's only half-finished."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo directly refused this time, causing Zheng Danlian to snort coldly in anger. <br/>
<br/>
During this time, Meng Kui's reply arrived in front of Zhu Xuanji. <br/>
<br/>
The letter confirmed Zhu Xuanji's suspicions were correct. The three techniques were indeed a set, belonging to the three sects' superior techniques. <br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui also calculated the approximate power of the Demonic Blood Vein Technique. The Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique involved creating mirrors in the divine sea and dantian, directly communicating with spiritual entities. Initially, these mirrors were few, but as cultivation progressed, their number and quality would increase!<br/>
<br/>
To win over others, Zhu Xuanji proactively shared the contents of the letter. <br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, watching from the side, was amazed, fully appreciating the profound understanding of cultivation by those at the Golden Core and nascent soul stages. Even a few words could quickly reveal subtleties.<br/>
<br/>
With the announcement of the second round of the examination, Ning Zhuo began to prepare actively. His days were far from peaceful. People continuously approached him, offering large sums of money, not only to purchase his Golden Core-level mechanical ape materials but also attempting to bribe him to throw matches. Ning Zhuo refused them all, displaying a demeanor that surprised even Ning Jiufan.<br/>
<br/>
First polite, then forceful. <br/>
<br/>
Many individuals and forces began to employ more intense methods surrounding the second round of the examination. <br/>
<br/>
A Foundation Establishment lone cultivator was left dead at night and only discovered at noon the next day. The cause of death was a pierced heart, with the soul completely gone. <br/>
<br/>
The businesses of the Ning, Zheng, and Zhou families were simultaneously targeted. Even the All-Book Pavilion's stronghold in Fire Persimmon Immortal City was robbed. <br/>
<br/>
According to witnesses, the perpetrator was a shadow demon cultivator. However, it was evident that targeting a super sect in such a manner was likely the work of another super sect taking advantage of the situation!<br/>
<br/>
"The second round of the examination..." <br/>
<br/>
"Hmph, they seem to be having fun." <br/>
<br/>
"Why don't we join in and participate a little, what do you say, Han Ming?" Luo Shang, residing in the Immortal City, looked towards the top of Fire Persimmon Mountain, sneering. <br/>
<br/>
Han Ming lowered her head, her eyebrows drooping, appearing extremely obedient, "Lord Luo Shang, how would you like me to proceed?" <br/>
<br/>
Her heart was filled with helplessness. After hiding for so long, the beast siege eventually exposed her whereabouts, leading to her being discovered by Luo Shang, who forcibly recruited her to his side. <br/>
<br/>
Luo Shang instructed, "Go contact the City Lord's Mansion." <br/>
<br/>
"They will surely be interested in your information." <br/>
<br/>
"Although Ning Zhuo is just a junior at the Qi Refining Stage, he has advanced to the second round. If something happens to him, Meng Kui's side can seize the opportunity to attack Zhu Xuanji's side vigorously." <br/>
<br/>
"When two tigers fight, the spectacle is much more entertaining." <br/>
<br/>
"Hahaha!"<br/>
