<div id="chapterContent">Chapter 269: Soul Searching Ning Zhuo

"Why are these characters... so small?" Zhu Xuanji frowned deeply.

He strained his eyes, but his vision remained blurry.

The blazing flames had distorted much of what he could see at the time, obscuring his view.

Ning Xiaohui's handwriting was minuscule, embedded within the inner layer of the ice block, making it difficult to discern.

This was indeed troublesome.

For Zhu Xuanji, if he had the physical object before him, he could have easily uncovered the truth with a sweep of his divine sense.

But what he was seeing now was a product of combined innate talent and spells, which did not allow for better clarity.

"Couldn’t it have been written a bit larger?"

"Ning Xiaohui knew her fate was sealed. Before her death, she used all her strength to create the ice brick, hoping it would be preserved." This was a plausible scenario.

"After all, the Ice Jade Hand is adept at surviving desperate situations." But ultimately, the ice brick was not left behind. "Innate talent is not the same as divine ability..."

As he pondered this, a glint of insight flashed in Zhu Xuanji's eyes.

"Ning Xiaohui seemed overly cautious."

"Furthermore, if she intended to leave clues, why didn’t she reveal the truth directly when she faced Zheng Shuangjun’s avatar?" One possibility was that Ning Xiaohui discovered something crucial or had a sudden realization after parting with Zheng Shuangjun's avatar. "Another possibility is that, before her death, Ning Xiaohui's mind was twisted by a desire for revenge, leading her to frame her enemies." There's also the possibility...

"In Ning Xiaohui's view, Zheng Shuangjun was not trustworthy!"

"Or, perhaps, she wanted to report directly to me rather than informing a Golden Core cultivator first." Zhu Xuanji's mind raced with various thoughts, each rising and falling like waves.

There were too many possibilities.

After a while, he set aside his chaotic thoughts.

"It can be confirmed that Sun Lingtong is the murderer of Ning Xiaohui." Moreover, he possesses the Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra.

What Zhu Xuanji saw in the second forest confirmed this.

"Fire Burial Prajna Spirit Unbinding Sutra! As recorded in the royal secrets, this Buddhist scripture can liberate life and extract spirituality." Sun Lingtong's mastery of this scripture is a clear indication of the Void Sect's deep infiltration into the Lava Immortal Palace.

"Void Sect..."

Zhu Xuanji silently gritted his teeth, feeling unprecedented hatred toward the Void Sect due to the day's events.

"Calm down. Stay calm."

"Anger is useless. The wisest decision now is to find Meng Kui!"

Zhu Xuanji barely managed to stabilize his mood.

With a wave of his arm, he collected all the silver furnace fragments scattered across the field.

Although he couldn’t clearly see Ning Xiaohui’s dying testimony, it didn’t matter; he had other methods!

"You all clean up the battlefield and try to gather clues." "I’m going out of the palace to speak with Meng Kui!"

Before leaving, Zhu Xuanji noticed Ning Zhuo looking at him eagerly. "Oh, right. Protect him!" "He is a pawn arranged by the Void Sect, but he has now repented and turned to the light."

The three Golden Core ancestors exchanged puzzled glances.

Zhu Xuanji continued, "Ning Zhuo is a crucial witness; his life must be protected at all costs!" The three Golden Core cultivators quickly nodded in agreement.

The next moment, Zhu Xuanji soared into the sky, leaving Ning Zhuo to face the scrutinizing gazes of the Golden Core cultivators alone.

Ning Zhuo, ever clever, immediately ran to Ning Jiufan's side. "Ancestor, Ancestor!" Ning Jiufan snorted coldly. "Tell us everything you know."

Though his expression was stern, he extended his arm to pull Ning Zhuo closer.

Ning Zhuo had already prepared a statement, which he had carefully crafted, originally intended for a second line of defense.

Now, he slightly altered the content and relayed it to the three Golden Core cultivators.

The Golden Core ancestors perked up their ears, listening intently.

Zhu Xuanji hadn’t heard it yet, but they learned first.

Meanwhile, Zhu Xuanji continued his journey, leaving the Immortal Palace once more.

Outside the Immortal Palace, the Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts were in a frenzy, their attacks growing increasingly aggressive.

However, with the Tomb Dao's assistance, Zhu Xuanji managed to leave smoothly.

Zhu Xuanji flew directly to Meng Kui’s location.

"City Lord Meng Kui, I have important information regarding the recent changes in the Lava Immortal Palace to share with you," Zhu Xuanji said directly.

Meng Kui responded, "Lord Zhu, please enlighten me."

Although Meng Kui was at the Nascent Soul level, Zhu Xuanji represented the royal family, so they communicated as equals.

Zhu Xuanji then explained how Ning Zhuo had confessed, speculating that the Void Sect was the mastermind behind the scenes.

Meng Kui's heart stirred, and after a moment of silence, he remarked, "What a Void Sect! Infiltrating the Lava Immortal Palace right under my nose with sinister intentions, inciting a Golden Core conflict. Now, killing Ning Xiaohui and destroying the Historical Records Pavilion just to eliminate evidence." "Since they were able to bombard the Historical Records Pavilion, it’s likely that the previous mysterious attack on Fire Persimmon Mountain by the Five Elements Tower, triggering a beast frenzy, was also their doing!"

"Such disregard for the lives of thousands in the city, truly demonic cultivators!" Zhu Xuanji cautioned, "This is just my speculation, without concrete evidence."

"I naturally trust Lord Zhu’s deductions," Meng Kui smiled.

Zhu Xuanji gave Meng Kui a deep look and stated his intention: "Since the Void Sect is a third-party force behind the scenes and has acted so outrageously, you and I should fully cooperate to eliminate them first!"

Meng Kui nodded, "Indeed. What plans does Lord Zhu have?" Zhu Xuanji spoke eloquently, outlining his strategy.

Meng Kui smiled, "Lord Zhu’s words are reasonable."

"If the Void Sect truly seizes the position of Palace Master, both the royal family and my Meng family will lose face."

"I also express my sincerity once again—willing to promise that regardless of whether it’s between you and me or among the other three families, whoever ultimately becomes the Palace Master, all our current positions in the Lava Immortal Palace will remain unchanged! Once the matter of the Lava Immortal Palace is settled, even if there are changes in positions, they will be according to the court’s rules. What do you think?"

Zhu Xuanji’s pupils contracted sharply, and alarm bells rang in his mind!

"What a Meng Kui! This is a blatant open scheme."

"No, perhaps someone among the three families has already secretly contacted Meng Kui..."

Zhu Xuanji could poach and win over the Zhou, Zheng, and Ning families.

As the city lord, backed by the Meng family, Meng Kui naturally had similar means.

It’s just a matter of who acted first.

In the current situation, Zhu Xuanji could only acknowledge and go with the flow.

Soon, they reached a cooperation agreement.

Both Zhu Xuanji and Meng Kui were under the Southern Bean Kingdom, belonging to the same faction.

Previously, although they regarded each other as primary opponents, they maintained a level of competition, always keeping a state of rivalry without breaking.

Thus, joining forces at this moment presented no obstacles.

Zhu Xuanji and Meng Kui both aimed to eliminate the Void Sect, allowing the position of city lord to be contested between their two factions.

If the Void Sect succeeded, the Zhu family of the Southern Bean Kingdom’s royal family and the Meng family of high officials would become laughingstocks, bringing shame...

This was something neither of them could accept!

After signing the contract, Zhu Xuanji took out a jade slip and handed it to Meng Kui.

The jade slip contained all the evidence, clues, and speculations he had gathered.

Most crucially, it contained the three scenes Zhu Xuanji "saw" on the silver furnace ruins.

Meng Kui held the jade slip, slowly closed his eyes, and his Nascent Soul-level aura suddenly expanded, fully utilizing his calculation method.

For a moment, mysteries overflowed, and smoke clouds billowed.

Several strands of Meng Kui’s hair instantly turned frost white.

He opened his eyes, revealing a look of fatigue.

Calculations often required consuming one of the most precious resources in the world—lifespan.

This time, Meng Kui’s calculations were no exception.

However, Zhu Xuanji had already promised that the lifespan consumed in this calculation would be compensated with longevity lingzhi from the royal treasury.

Zhu Xuanji asked, "Did you gain anything?"

Meng Kui nodded slightly, "I obtained four clues. They are: Ning Zhuo, Sun Lingtong, Zheng Danlian, and the Golden Furnace." For a moment, Zhu Xuanji frowned tightly.

The appearance of Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong was completely understandable to him.

But why Zheng Dan?

And why the Golden Furnace?

Zheng Danlian was one of the two Golden Core cultivators of the Zheng family, and the Golden Furnace was the highest-grade refining furnace in the Lava Immortal Palace.

"Why were these two clues mentioned by Ning Xiaohui before her death?"

Meng Kui interrupted Zhu Xuanji's thoughts: "Among the four clues, Ning Zhuo is the easiest to investigate.

 In my opinion, we should directly capture him and conduct a soul search!" Ning Zhuo was only at the Qi Refining Stage, easy to handle.

The only challenge was dealing with Ning Jiufan’s reaction.

Zhu Xuanji didn’t hesitate and directly refused: "Inappropriate."

"Ning Zhuo indeed has ties with the Void Sect, but I have already made him confess and surrender." "He is my person and will be of great use in the future."

Meng Kui smiled slightly, unfazed by the refusal: "Lord Zhu, as a divine constable, is naturally more adept at solving cases and pursuing criminals than I am. I will watch with anticipation." With that, Zhu Xuanji and Meng Kui parted ways.

As Zhu Xuanji’s figure faded into the distance, Meng Kui’s gaze turned cold.

"It seems Zhu Xuanji hasn’t realized that the dragon turtle fire spirit has already developed other intentions." "But at this rate, he will soon!" "Void Sect? Hmph!"

Meng Kui didn’t place much importance on the Void Sect’s activities.

After all, the Void Sect had only dispatched one Golden Core true disciple and one Foundation Establishment Stage outer disciple.

If a Nascent Soul-level cultivator from the Void Sect had appeared, it would be an entirely different matter.

Thus, even though Meng Kui discovered that the Void Sect was a third-party force lurking all along, he didn’t rush to take action personally.

"Stabilize it with calmness."

"Let Zhu Xuanji investigate the Void Sect. It’s good to occupy some of his time and energy."

With that thought, Meng Kui sent orders, commanding the cultivators on his side in the Immortal Palace to strive for as many key positions as possible.

At the same time, he ordered his trusted aides to make every effort to contact the dragon turtle fire spirit!

Zhu Xuanji returned to the Lava Immortal Palace.

Along the way, his brows remained tightly furrowed, his gaze deep and contemplative.

If Ning Zhuo hadn’t confessed voluntarily, in the current situation, Zhu Xuanji might have hesitated—considering whether to soul search Ning Zhuo.

But now, having just turned to the light, Ning Zhuo was to be soul searched?

The consequences of a soul search were severe, ranging from memory loss to dementia.

In such matters, anyone with political acumen wouldn’t make such a rash decision.

Least of all, Zhu Xuanji.

"Now, with the alliance of the three families, a rift has already formed with the Zheng family. If I soul search Ning Zhuo, it would lead to a superficial relationship with the Ning family." "Meng Kui wants me to soul search Ning Zhuo... He's just a small Qi Refining Stage cultivator, an outer pawn of the Void Sect. What could he possibly know?" "Moreover, Meng Kui is also suspicious!"

Zhu Xuanji calculated the time.

When the Lava Immortal Palace breach occurred, Meng Kui didn’t take action promptly.

The three Golden Core cultivators had all sent emergency flying messages, but without Meng Kui’s protection, those messages would be attacked and destroyed by the omnipresent Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts as soon as they left the Lava Immortal Palace.

"So, Meng Kui deliberately suppressed the spread of the messages, delaying their transmission and causing me to receive them very late." "The Meng family’s desire to seize the Lava Immortal Palace is too intense."</div>
