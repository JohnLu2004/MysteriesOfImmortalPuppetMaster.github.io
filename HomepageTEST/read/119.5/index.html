<div id="chapterContent">Chapter 119.5 Stuck in Review (Author's Note)

I just got up and noticed that the scheduled update failed.

The draft is under review...

This is the first time I've encountered this situation.

Clicking the button only results in waiting for 5 minutes, then checking the review status again and failing.

I've contacted the editor and requested a manual review, but there's no response yet.

I don't know what's going on.

***********

Monk Doleey (Editor): There were some technical issues which have now been resolved. 

I'll post a note update in the new chapters released later today. </div>
