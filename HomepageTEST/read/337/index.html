The tiger deity of Cloud Concealment Mountain was such an example, but strangely, it seemed to have no desire for worship.
As for the fox deity... according to the village elder, it had failed to advance to the Golden Core stage as a wild fox demon beast about ten years ago, and its remnant soul had turned to the path of deities.
It had been very dedicated in its management, and judging from the number of believers, it was much stronger than the tiger deity.
If this trend continues, the tiger deity might be pushed aside in the future. When that happened, the fox deity would become the main mountain god of Cloud Concealment Mountain, while the tiger deity would be secondary.
Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong focused their discussion on estimating the strength of these two mountain gods.
The tiger deity's strength, no matter how strong, couldnâ€™t exceed the Nascent Soul level. If it had Nascent Soul level strength, its sphere of influence should not be limited to just this Cloud Concealment Mountain.
The fox deity's strength could be accurately estimated. It was a Foundation Establishment stage demon cultivator in its previous life, failing to break through to the Golden Core stage before turning to the path of deities.
In the early stages of its conversion to the deity path, its combat power should have been among the weaker ones at the Foundation Establishment level.
But over the years, it had extensively collected worship, and was in its own domain. Its combat power should be estimated a level higher.
By normal reasoning, the fox deity should have Golden Core level combat power.
"No need to worry too much," Sun Lingtong said. "I'm at the late Foundation Establishment stage, with the Void Sect's techniques to rely on. Even facing a Golden Core cultivator, I have the ability to escape."
"Little Zhuo, your body's combat power is not weak. If it really comes to a fight, just release your mechanical constructs. Whether it's the Blood Battle Ape, Dasheng, the Netherworld Envoy, Qi Bai, or Rudie Niang, they all have near-Golden Core combat power."
"Not to mention the Buddhist Healer and the Ten Thousand Li Traveling Dragon."
However, Ning Zhuo appeared very cautious: "Big brother, don't be careless."
"Don't forget, we're in the wild now, not in the city. In the city, there's the Immortal City Grand Formation suppressing attacks, which drastically reduces the gap between different cultivation levels. We might even be lucky enough to directly confront a Golden Core cultivator for a few moves."
"But in the wild, without the Immortal City Grand Formation's suppression, the difference between Golden Core level and near-Golden Core will be significant, not to mention mere Foundation Establishment cultivators like us."
"We still need to be cautious."
Sun Lingtong said loudly: "You're thinking too much, Little Zhuo. You've had a tough time these past ten or so years."
"Seizing the Lava Immortal Palace was too difficult for both of us."
"Relax a bit."
"We don't need to think about the Lava Immortal Palace for now, this is just Cloud Concealment Mountain."
"Those two are official deities, how could they possibly act recklessly against us?"
"We're just looking for something on the Cloud Concealment Mountain, and we've carefully prepared offerings. We're not here to challenge their authority."
"Compared to the Fire Persimmon Immortal City, this is completely different in difficulty, one is underground, one is in the sky."
"Little Zhuo, your nerves are too tense, it's time to relax. Just consider this a vacation."
Ning Zhuo was silent for a moment: "A vacation..."
He sighed: "Big brother, I hope the things that follow will develop as you've predicted."
The next day.
Sun and Ning bid farewell to the village elder, left the mountain village, and directly climbed the mountain.
The sun rose in the east, its light filtering through the treetops, scattering into a soft golden glow.
Mountain mist permeated the air, like ribbons of milky white silk, twining among the verdant pines and cypresses, drifting with the wind, sometimes contracting, sometimes dispersing, ever-changing.
The green leaves in the mountains, nourished by the morning dew, appeared even more lush and vibrant. Crystal-clear dewdrops condensed on the leaf tips, and as a gentle breeze passed by, the dewdrops slid off lightly, glittering in the morning light.
Sun and Ning didn't conceal their auras. Their Foundation Establishment cultivation was somewhat impressive, at least enough to scare away many wild beasts and spirits.
By the time they arrived at the tiger deity temple on the north side of the mountain, the sun had risen high.
The mountain mist had thinned considerably, and the view had become expansive.
Birds flew freely between the mountains, their calls echoing in the ears. On the mountainside, there was a large patch of wildflowers, a riot of colors.
The tiger deity temple had white walls and gray tiles, simple and clean.
The temple door was made of wood, plain and unadorned. A plaque hung on the door lintel, inscribed with the three characters "Night Tiger Mountain God Temple", the calligraphy forceful and vigorous.
After paying their respects, Sun and Ning pushed open the door and entered.
The small courtyard inside the temple was empty, with only a huge bronze incense burner hanging with some moss.
The two continued forward, entering the main hall, where they saw the statue of the tiger deity. It had a tiger's head and a human body, a burly figure. The statue was over a zhang tall, with a majestic demeanor and piercing eyes.
The wooden incense table was clean and dust-free. On the table was an incense burner, and several offerings, all fruits and vegetables produced in the mountains, natural and unadorned.
The four walls were painted with murals depicting the tiger deity protecting the forest and driving away evil, the images vivid and lively.
After inspecting, Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong took out the deity-summoning incense they had prepared earlier, lit it, and inserted it into the incense burner.
They also laid out the prepared offerings. The quality of the offerings reached the Foundation Establishment level, also carefully prepared.
Ning Zhuo stood before the deity statue, took out the sacrificial text, and recited loudly: "In the year of Jia Chen, in the ninth month of autumn, on the day of Xinsi, in the early morning. I, of the Ning family, unworthy as I am, respectfully prepare the three sacrificial animals, incense, paper money, bathe and change clothes, and bow reverently before the Mountain God Temple."
"May the Mountain God's spiritual power protect this region, safeguard all living beings, and bestow blessings upon all things..."
"...Mountain God's spiritual power, knowing past and present, aware of the old affairs of the mountain. I, of the Ning family, have a wish, hoping the Mountain God will inform us of old matters in the mountain, to seek out old objects of our ancestors. Therefore, we make this sacrifice to the Mountain God, humbly requesting your mercy, to use your divine power to reveal their traces, and bless the Ning family to find them soon."
"We respectfully offer this, may you accept it."
"The Ning family bows twice!"
As the sacrificial text finished, a mountain wind suddenly rose.
Sun and Ning heard a tiger's roar in their ears, like a thunderclap.
Then, a shadowy figure of a tiger-headed giant stepped out of the statue. It looked down at the two from above, then opened its mouth and inhaled, and a weak suction force drew in the three sacrificial animals and other offerings Ning Zhuo had presented.
The deity-summoning incense also burned to ashes in an instant.
After the tiger deity had its fill, it leisurely turned around and merged back into the statue, leaving only a sentence: "I've taken your stuff. Go find my deputy, the fox deity, and tell it I said to help you look."
The shadowy figure quickly merged back into the statue, with no further changes.
Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong looked at each other, speechless.
Unable to do anything else, they had to set off to leave. As they exited the temple, the temple door automatically closed behind them.
Ning Zhuo shook his head and sighed.
When they were far enough away, he transmitted to Sun Lingtong: "I didn't expect this tiger deity to be so simple-minded. From what I've seen, it probably hands over all daily prayers to the deputy mountain god to handle. No wonder the fox deity almost exclusively enjoys the worship."
Sun Lingtong put his hands behind his head: "Hehe, sleeping soundly when there's nothing to do, tossing the offerings and letting the deputy do the work when there is. This kind of life indeed makes one..."
This kind of life indeed makes one a bit envious.
Ning Zhuo helplessly said: "We can only go to the fox deity temple now."
The two headed towards the south of the mountain, and soon arrived at their destination.
The temple complex was extensive, with a very high standard.
The main gate was tall, supported by vermilion pillars carved with cloud patterns and auspicious beasts. Above hung a huge plaque inscribed with the three characters "Cloud Fox Deity Temple", gleaming with golden light, majestic and imposing.
As Sun and Ning stepped through the main gate, two fox attendants wearing Daoist robes, walking upright like humans, came forward to greet them and actively led them inside to offer incense.
Entering the front hall, they saw four clay statues, representing a lobster-axeman, an ant-spearman, a sharp-nosed pangolin, and a weasel with a protruding mouth.
"These are the four guardian generals under our deity," the fox attendant explained in a formal manner.
Passing through the front hall into the courtyard, Sun and Ning saw two ancient pine trees, one on the left and one on the right, their canopies like pavilions, full of vitality.
Looking straight ahead, they saw the main hall with multiple eaves and upturned corners, covered with golden tiles. Phoenix bells hung from the eaves, their tinkling sound pleasing to the ear, like celestial music.
Sun and Ning entered the main hall. The incense table inside was expansive, with precious offerings on it. The incense burner stood alone, all made of pure gold with exquisite craftsmanship. On both sides of the incense table stood tall red candles, their flames flickering, incense smoke curling.
The walls of the hall were hung with embroidered paintings, telling the legendary stories of the fox deity's divine manifestations and protection.
Sun Lingtong transmitted to Ning Zhuo, his tone emotional: "Without comparison, there's no harm."
Ning Zhuo's eyes gleamed brightly: "The actions truly match the words. Today's experience, corresponding with what's recorded in books, deepens my understanding. Deity path cultivation emphasizes the people's support. In the future, when I lead the Ning family branch, I can emulate this place."
Ning Zhuo took out the deity-summoning incense and the three sacrificial animals and other offerings.
This time, just as he lit the deity-summoning incense, the clay statue of the fox deity came to life, emitting a gentle voice: "What do the two worshippers seek?"
Ning Zhuo then stated his request once again.
At the end, he added that he had received the permission of the main mountain god during his sacrifice at the Night Tiger Mountain God Temple.
The fox deity smiled slightly: "Even if Lord Night Tiger hadn't allowed it, seeing how sincere you two are, this deity would have helped. Now, tell me what you need to search for?"
This proactive and cooperative attitude formed a stark contrast with the tiger deity.
Ning Zhuo then said: "I'm not quite sure what the specific item looks like. I come from the Ning family. Sixteen years ago, my Ning family was traveling and passed through Cloud Concealment Mountain. They ended up being trapped by the mountain mist for many days."
"What I want to find are the various items left behind by the Ning family team when they passed through here. I beseech the Mountain God to help!"
The fox deity's face showed a reminiscent look: "Sixteen years ago... I have a deep impression. At that time, I was still a Foundation Establishment stage demon cultivator, using the mountain mist to temper my innate talents. I was fortunate to receive help from a Golden Core big sister, drank some spirit tea, gained enlightenment about the principles within the mist, which greatly increased my innate powers."
"Young man, I sense your aura is very similar to that big sister of mine. May I ask what your relationship is with her?"
Ning Zhuo exclaimed in surprise: "My mother's surname is Meng, given name Yaoyin. I'm afraid she's the person the deity is referring to. I didn't expect my mother to have such an acquaintance with the Fox Deity."
The fox deity immediately nodded, saying joyfully: "Since you're the child of an old friend, this deity is even more willing to help! How is your mother now..."
Ning Zhuo: "My mother has gone on a distant journey. This junior is currently carrying out my mother's task, to collect old objects along the way for the purpose of deduction and calculation."
The fox deity nodded: "I see."
"Your mother's grace and bearing, this little fox still can't forget..."
"Since it's your mother's order, this deity will immediately use magic to search the entire Cloud Concealment Mountain!"
"Young friend, please go to the side hall to rest for a while and wait for good news."
The fox deity was true to its word and immediately started using magic.
In an instant, the mountain mist visibly thickened, rapidly spreading, obscuring the sky and covering the entire Cloud Concealment Mountain.
Sun Lingtong looked through the window at the vast white mist and transmitted in a serious tone: "This fox deity definitely has Golden Core combat power, and quite formidable at that!"
Ning Zhuo muttered: "Unexpectedly, the fox deity had some interaction with my mother. This is great, after this matter, I must ask properly..."
Before he could finish speaking, the thick, sticky mist seeped through the cracks in the doors and windows, pressing towards Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong.
The fox deity's voice drifted over: "Young friend, in the past, your mother once gave me an object, shaped like a flower petal, which greatly increased my innate talents. Since you've come here on her orders, you must have received instructions from your mother. Could you perhaps offer another flower petal as a reward?"</div>
