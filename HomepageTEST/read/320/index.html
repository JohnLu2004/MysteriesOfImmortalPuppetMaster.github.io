<div id="chapterContent">Chapter 320: Quickly Restrain Ning Zhuo

Zhu Xuanji's pupils reflected the crimson flames, and the wind chime in his heart kept ringing!

At first glance, he saw through the situation in the Secret Pavilion completely.

"The karmic fire burns, this is the retribution by using forbidden techniques." Zhu Xuanji sneered inwardly, "Ning Zhuo, you have ended up in this predicament, and it's well-deserved." Just as this thought crossed his mind, he heard a roar.

A figure as burly and robust as him, the Heavy Armored Blood Ape Dasheng, charged into his embrace, wrapping its arms around his waist and sprinting with all its might, crashing into the battlefield!

No other mechanical construct could achieve this level of autonomy. Only Yuan Dasheng, having reached the wisdom spirit stage, could analyze the battle situation and act with greater independence.

Zhu Xuanji's face turned with anger, swinging his elbow to strike the back of the Heavy Armored Blood Ape Dasheng, each blow creating a small deep pit.

Yuan Dasheng, however, ignored it, exerting all his strength to distance Zhu Xuanji from Ning Zhuo.

Sun Lingtong reacted quickly, immediately standing guard beside Ning Zhuo.

Everything had happened too fast.

The door opened, Zhu Xuanji, shrouded in golden light, appeared, only to be knocked away by Yuan Dasheng.

Ning Xiaohui's grandmother and others surrounded them.

"It's done! Hahaha." Meng Chong laughed heartily.

Following Meng Kui's orders, he seized the doorway, swiftly maneuvering the wooden blocks to complete the final segment.

Originally, Ning Zhuo had already pieced together the majority. Meng Chong, using his innate talent to enhance his actions, completed the final steps within a dozen breaths.

The content was accurate, the door opened, and a brilliant light shot up to the sky, illuminating the Secret Pavilion, making it stand out.

Inside the door, a vortex resembling a starry sky formed, and without hesitation, Meng Chong rushed in!

"Not good, he went in!" someone shouted.

"Quick, stop Meng Chong!"

"The position of the Lava Immortal Palace's palace master... is mine." The number of people attacking Ning Zhuo instantly decreased by more than half.

They were blinded by fate energy, but when it came to immense benefits, their greedy desires overshadowed the crimson flames in their eyes.

Only Ning Xiaohui's grandmother, Ning Xiaoren, Ning Ze, and others continued their siege on Ning Zhuo.

Sun Lingtong struggled to defend, blocking left and right, soon covered in blood.

His combat style was agile and mobile, but to protect Ning Zhuo, he had to abandon his combat strengths, almost entirely on the defensive!

His previous injuries hadn't healed, and he wasn't in full condition.

The most crucial point was his demoralized spirit, inexplicably loathing and resenting Ning Zhuo, a psychological state that left him with only thirty to forty percent of his combat strength.

In contrast, Ning Xiaohui's grandmother and others were clearly empowered by forbidden techniques. Their combat strength had multiplied several times compared to their peak!

"Sun Lingtong, you outsider, mind your own business!" Ning Xiaoren shouted.

Ning Ze: "Ning Zhuo, this ungrateful wretch, is a thankless wolf! He doesn't even care about blood ties! I shouldn't have raised him." Sun Lingtong cursed angrily: "You are the outsiders! What did you ever raise?!" Ning Xiaohui's grandmother took advantage of the chaos among the three, swooping towards Ning Zhuo like a hawk.

The flames in her eyes were the most intense!

"A rabbit born without a mother! Give me back my Xiaohui!!" She mercilessly attacked the defenseless Ning Zhuo.

Void Traversing Technique

In the critical moment, Sun Lingtong quickly turned and used the Void Sect's signature technique.

However, this time, he didn't use it on himself.

Ning Xiaohui's grandmother was hit by the Void Traversing Technique, disappearing from her original spot, transported to the adjacent Secret Pavilion.

Sun Lingtong, thus distracted, was severely injured by Ning Ze and Ning Xiaoren, kicked into a corner.

The small door that Yuan Dasheng had knocked open remained wide open.

The shadow demon cultivator and Chi Dun, while fiercely fighting, rushed over!

Stone Heart Delaying Technique!

Lime Heart Technique!

Chi Dun's fist was enveloped in a gray light, striking the shadow demon cultivator's back.

The shadow demon cultivator countered with a cloud of black smoke, releasing dozens of ropes to bind Chi Dun.

Chi Dun, bound by the ropes, crashed solidly into the wall due to his own inertia.

The shadow demon cultivator, hit by the heavy punch, accelerated towards the Secret Pavilion where the door was located.

"Hmph, hit by my Lime Heart Technique, you will..." Chi Dun's eyes widened.

Because, in the next moment, he witnessed the shadow demon cultivator's body emitting a faint yellow Buddha light, quickly dispelling the gray-white light on his back.

The shadow demon cultivator let out a hoarse laugh, rushing towards the small door.

Despite the Buddha light flashing, others felt an overwhelming demonic aura!

Martial Technique—Mountain Separating, Mountain Separating, Mountain Separating!

Zhu Xuanji struck consecutively with his palms.

Even though the Heavy Armored Blood Ape Dasheng's interior had been temporarily reinforced by Ning Zhuo, it couldn't withstand the Golden Core stage's attacks, and was shattered into pieces once more.

Yuan Dasheng still wanted to resist, but Zhu Xuanji stepped back, creating distance, and reached out with both hands, inserting his fingers into the Heavy Armored Blood Ape Dasheng's chest, then forcefully tearing it apart!

Disembowelment!

The Heavy Armored Blood Ape Dasheng knelt on the ground, raising its resentful head, completely suppressed under the Golden Mountain Stance.

"Pitiful, lamentable, pathetic." Zhu Xuanji's face was expressionless, but his tone was full of emotion.

He had recognized this as Yuan Dasheng's spirit.

However, just as he was about to bypass Yuan Dasheng and rush towards the Secret Pavilion's door, he suddenly stopped.

He saw the shattered fragments of the mechanical heart sphere and the unlit fire persimmons.

The fire persimmons were of high grade, mostly thousand-year fire persimmons, and even some ten-thousand-year fire persimmons.

In an instant, Zhu Xuanji felt as if struck by lightning!

He froze in place, his heart skipping a beat, gripped by intense horror!

All the clues connected at this moment.

The truth was revealed!

"Xiaohui, my Xiaohui!" Ning Xiaohui's grandmother had lost her mind, having been transported out by Sun Lingtong, she frantically charged back.

Before entering the small door, she encountered the shadow demon cultivator.

With a gentle wave of the arm, the shadow demon cultivator decapitated Ning Xiaohui's grandmother, a fountain of blood gushing from her neck.

Dead.

This terrified Ning Xiaoren and Ning Ze, cold sweat pouring down, their strong survival instincts overpowering the crimson flames in their eyes.

The two retreated simultaneously.

Sun Lingtong, dragging his heavily injured body, reached Ning Zhuo's side. Just as he was about to drag Ning Zhuo away, he looked up to see the shadow demon cultivator close at hand.

The intense pressure bore down like a mountain.

Sun Lingtong's eyes bulged, bloodshot, as he roared, ready to abandon Ning Zhuo and charge forward himself.

The next moment, he was knocked down with a single finger.

Thud.

He fell to the ground, his cheek pressed against the cold floor, his heart as cold as the tiles.

He looked despairingly at the unconscious Ning Zhuo.

If possible, he would trade his life for Ning Zhuo's survival!

Ning Xiaoren and Ning Ze, seeing this, retreated even faster.

"Don't retreat, quickly restrain Ning Zhuo!!" Almost simultaneously, Zhu Xuanji burst into the adjacent Secret Pavilion, shouting anxiously.

Ning Xiaoren and Ning Ze were baffled.

It was already too late.

The shadow demon cultivator slowly bent down, extending its mechanical arm and hand, gently supporting Ning Zhuo.

The faint yellow Buddha light shone, suppressing the crimson flames burning on Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo finally regained some strength, relying on the shadow demon cultivator's arm to stand with all his might.

Such a simple action had already exhausted his remaining pitiful strength.

He was drenched in cold sweat, barely opening his eyes, his vision gradually clearing.

He looked at the shadow demon cultivator beside him, revealing a gentle, relaxed, silent smile.

The next moment, Sun Lingtong's eyes widened, pupils constricting, showing an extremely shocked expression.

Because he heard Ning Zhuo softly call out—
