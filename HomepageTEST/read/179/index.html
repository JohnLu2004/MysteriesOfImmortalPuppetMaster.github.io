As the two sides faced off, on the verge of clashing, Zheng Hua hurriedly intervened, "Everyone, calm down!"  

"The real battle hasn't even started, and we're already fighting amongst ourselves."  

"Such behavior would tarnish the Ning family's reputation," Zhou Zeshen and others echoed in agreement.

Under the persuasion of the crowd, Ning Zhuo, Ning Xiaohui, and the mysterious Snow Soul finally restrained their qi and temporarily ceased their confrontation.  

When they sat down again, Ning Xiaohui and Ning Zhuo were already far apart.

Tong Zetuo smiled and cupped his hands towards the mysterious Snow Soul, "May I ask for the esteemed senior's name?"  

The mysterious Snow Soul, exuding a Foundation Establishment aura, replied proudly, "I am Ning Xie. In life, I was an elder of the Ning family, possessing the Heavenly Talent Snow Soul Ice Spirit. After dying in battle, I became a ghost cultivator. This time, I have come out of seclusion for our joint operation."  

Zhou Zeshen was puzzled, "Senior, as a Foundation Establishment ghost cultivator, how can you enter the Immortal Palace?"  

Ghost cultivator Ning Xie explained, "It's not difficult. I can attach myself to Xiaohui's soul, temporarily merging with her."  

"When Ning Xiaohui's soul enters the Immortal Palace, I can be brought in as well."

"However, if I reveal myself to fight, I can only exist for thirteen breaths. Beyond that, I will be expelled by the Lava Immortal Palace."  

Zheng Jian spoke up, confirming from the side, "We have already verified this situation." He was indeed an insider.

Zhou Zeshen's gaze darkened slightly.  

He keenly sensed that the Ning and Zheng families seemed closer than he had anticipated.

On the surface, Zhou Zeshen cupped his hands, his face showing joy, "With senior's assistance, using the Heavenly Talent Snow Soul Ice Spirit, our chances of victory greatly increase."  

Ning Xie snorted coldly, "Naturally."  

Ning Zhuo also snorted coldly, "Only thirteen breaths of time, what can you do? Freeze the entire checkpoint?"  

Ning Xie squinted his eyes, his expression extremely cold, "You are right, I can freeze the surroundings and alter the battlefield. If you don't believe me, you'll get a taste of it!"  

Ning Zhuo laughed, "Freeze our own people? You died, and your brain died with you?"  

"Can you freeze that mechanical ape and the puppet slaves?"  

"Oh, right."  

"If you get enslaved by the puppets, it would be hilarious!"

"Shut up!" Ning Xie cursed angrily, "Brat, sharp-tongued! If you keep yapping, I'll tear your mouth apart."  

Ning Zhuo's face turned serious, his gaze darkened, "Who is yapping with you?"  

"What I pointed out is the biggest hidden danger! I'm considering the overall situation, and you think I'm just yapping with you?"  

Ning Zhuo pointed at Ning Xie, "My concern is straightforward, can this ghost cultivator be brought in?"  

"Don't let him become a weapon against us!"

Ning Xie trembled with anger, his entire soul turning paler.

Just as he was about to speak, an elderly voice came, "On this point, I can vouch for it."  

Everyone's expressions changed.  

Ning Xie immediately shut his mouth.

Then, the Ning family patriarch walked in.

He stared at Ning Zhuo, smiling coldly, "Ning Zhuo, you are very thorough in your considerations."  

"But you are still too young to understand the mysteries of ghost cultivation and the foundation of the Ning family!"  

Ning Zhuo cupped his hands, his gaze calm, fearlessly meeting the patriarch's eyes, "If that's the case, I can only remain skeptical."  

Then, he changed his tone, "But I still do not recommend acting so hastily."  

"We currently lack reliable intelligence."

"We can wait for the spell to be improved and use the improved spell for reconnaissance."  

"After all, the opponents are just two mechanical war puppets. Once we know their details, their chances of winning are very low."

Zhou Zeshen inwardly applauded.  

He didn't expect Ning Zhuo to be so tough! He directly confronted the Ning family's Foundation Establishment elder, even the patriarch.  

"How much cultivation does he have? Only the third layer of Qi Refining. Truly courageous!" Zhou Zeshen even felt a slight admiration.

Zheng Jian and Zhou Zhu felt the same.  

Zheng Hua thought, "Ning Zhuo is young and impetuous, daring to confront his own patriarch publicly."  

"However, considering his actions, it is understandable."  

"Now that he has become the master of the black market, his power has greatly increased, achieving unprecedented success. He is in a period of expansion."  

"If I were him, I would be even more arrogant."

"If this continues, the Ning family will have a second internal war. We can provide significant support!"

Hearing Ning Zhuo's suggestion to continue reconnaissance, Zhou Zeshen thought for a moment and agreed, "Forgive my rudeness, but I also think continued reconnaissance is better."  

"Intelligence is crucial! Especially for our kind of battle, more intelligence can greatly affect the outcome."  

"Hmm? Zhou Zeshen is so openly siding with Ning Zhuo?" Zheng Jian was also surprised.

In Fire Persimmon Immortal City, the four major forces were in constant competition, forming a complex web of relationships.  

Outstanding family members were very sensitive to the relationships between families.

Zheng Jian thought for a moment and spoke, "Indeed, we started improving reconnaissance spells long ago."  

"But it will take some time to complete."  

"In fact, our family has been purchasing and borrowing related enlightenment diagrams."

"However, even with enlightenment diagrams, it depends on the cultivator's comprehension. Those with average comprehension gain little from them."  

Ning Zhuo spread his hands, "Then we can wait."  

"I believe our reformation team is full of talent. Someone will comprehend it, or we can wait until the three families improve the spell. Once we have the reconnaissance results, we can attack with confidence!"

"Speaking of enlightenment diagrams, I have two. Maybe I can share them with everyone."  

"Shut up!" Ning Xiaohui almost jumped, "The enlightenment diagrams are lent to you by the family for personal use. How can you share them with outsiders?"  

Ghost cultivator Ning Xie also said, "Ning family branch junior, do you know nothing of family law? You have no right to distribute these diagrams."  

Ning Zhuo laughed, "I was just making a suggestion. The patriarch is here, what do you say?"

The Ning family patriarch felt extremely uncomfortable, as if he had swallowed a fly.  

As the head of the family, he couldn't openly oppose Ning Xiaohui.  

Facing members of the Zheng and Zhou families, under the alliance of the three families, he couldn't outright refuse.  

This situation put him in a difficult position, thanks to Ning Zhuo.

For the first time, the Ning family patriarch regretted his hasty appearance, feeling he had acted without enough consideration.

Zhou Zeshen suddenly laughed, "If the Ning family is willing to share two enlightenment diagrams, I propose our family also share two diagrams with the reformation team."  

Zheng Jian was about to speak when Zheng Hua stepped in, "Good! I can immediately offer our family's Flame Peak Steaming Cloud Diagram and Earth Furnace Spouting Fire Diagram for everyone to study."  

The Ning family patriarch laughed, "Sharing enlightenment diagrams is no problem for the Ning family."  

"But even if we comprehend something, it requires extensive practice and is difficult to use in battle."  

"It's better to focus on special training, developing coordination and tacit understanding, which is more useful than comprehending spells."  

"This battle must be fought quickly!"

"The specifics can't be disclosed, but I can tell you it concerns the Golden Core ancestors of our three families."  

Everyone was shocked.

The Ning family patriarch was warning them: don't just consider the battle itself.

There are powerful external factors forcing a quick resolution!  

The battle is just a tool.

"The battle isn't the goal, so what is the real goal?" Ning Zhuo sighed inwardly.  

He deliberately provoked others to gather more intelligence.  

Since his conflict with the Ning family's main branch was irreconcilable, he didn't care about superficial harmony.

The gains were substantial.  

He not only gathered a lot of intelligence but also gained the opportunity to study four new enlightenment diagrams!  

The Ning family patriarch's revelation about the Golden Core was also good news for Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo often read historical records, seeing cases where kings or ministers, ignoring the actual situation, commanded armies recklessly, leading to disastrous defeats.  

Initially, he thought these people were foolish.  

But as he grew older, especially in recent days, he deeply felt human limitations and better understood their "foolishness."

Is it foolishness?  

It's foolishness, wisdom, and helplessness.  

Everyone has their own pressures and motivations, desires and fears.  

These factors intertwine, making pure battles impure.

Just as Ning Zhuo needed Yuan Dasheng to win small victories, not big victories or defeats, the three families' hasty action stemmed from the Golden Core ancestors' mysterious decisions.

Reading as a youth, I laughed at the mundane.

Reading again, I am now a character in the book.  

The world within the book is beyond one's control, but the vastness of it is cherished!

Zhou Zeshen sighed, "It seems we have no choice but to proceed."  

Ning Zhuo looked at Zheng Hua, "Since it's the will of the three Golden Core ancestors, Ning Xie must be involved."  

"If the Ning family is like this, the Zheng and Zhou families must also have some cards to play?"

Zheng Hua laughed, "I was just about to say."  

"An ancestor of our family once stumbled into the Ghost Market, losing half his life but gaining something."  

"This technique is called the Ghost Martial Divine Soldier Tempering Method. It consumes soul power to cut part of the soul, creating ghostly weapons."  

"Once mastered, you essentially have a half-life weapon. When the soul enters the Immortal Palace, you can obtain corresponding mechanical parts in the first room."  

Everyone looked at Zheng Jian.

Zheng Jian had a hook-shaped magical artifact floating beside him.

When his soul entered the Immortal Palace, he also had corresponding wooden hook parts floating around him.  

Zheng Jian quickly explained, "This is not a ghost weapon."</div>
