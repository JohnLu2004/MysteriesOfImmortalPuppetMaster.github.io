<div id="chapterContent">Chapter 156.6: Additional chapter in question: 154

This chapter is a make-up update for the missed update on June 22, and it will be the last time I compensate for such an issue.

The missed update was not my fault and was completely out of my control.

If I were to compensate for every missed update, it would greatly disrupt the daily update rhythm and the plot's pacing.

This would be more harmful than beneficial to the book's updates.

Since I didn't inform everyone in advance, I'm still compensating with this update at the end of the month.

I've seen everyone's suggestions for more updates.

I read the comments on almost every chapter every day.

My update speed has always been a weakness, and I've been pushing myself hard with the updates in June.

Long-time readers should be very aware of this.

Such a pace is quite rare in my writing career.

However, this time, Mysteries of the Immortal Puppet Master has received such strong support from everyone, and I really want to give back to you all.

Many people have also expressed interest in watching my live broadcasts and asked about updates on platforms like TikTok.

My response is: there will be updates, and I'm also considering a second live broadcast.

But my main focus has always been on writing the book well.

After the book was released in June, I struggled to adapt to the workload.

My energy and time are very limited, so I can only prioritize the main tasks and let go of the minor ones.

My plan for July is to maintain normal updates with two chapters per day, allowing me to adapt to this work schedule and prepare myself.

In July, the first volume will reach its climax.

In August, I aim to significantly increase the number of updates.

At that time, I will give it my all! (I also want to push myself hard and see where my limits lie.) I hope everyone can vote for **Xiangong Kaiwu** with your monthly tickets. 

This is very important for both me and my new book Mysteries of the Immortal Puppet Master!

Everyone, please support me! (Bows)

Let's continue this journey together.</div>
