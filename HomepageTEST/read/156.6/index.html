This chapter is a make-up update for the missed update on June 22, and it will be the last time I compensate for such an issue.<br/>
<br/>
The missed update was not my fault and was completely out of my control.<br/>
<br/>
If I were to compensate for every missed update, it would greatly disrupt the daily update rhythm and the plot's pacing.<br/>
<br/>
This would be more harmful than beneficial to the book's updates.<br/>
<br/>
Since I didn't inform everyone in advance, I'm still compensating with this update at the end of the month.<br/>
<br/>
I've seen everyone's suggestions for more updates.<br/>
<br/>
I read the comments on almost every chapter every day.<br/>
<br/>
My update speed has always been a weakness, and I've been pushing myself hard with the updates in June.<br/>
<br/>
Long-time readers should be very aware of this.<br/>
<br/>
Such a pace is quite rare in my writing career.<br/>
<br/>
However, this time, Mysteries of the Immortal Puppet Master has received such strong support from everyone, and I really want to give back to you all.<br/>
<br/>
Many people have also expressed interest in watching my live broadcasts and asked about updates on platforms like TikTok.<br/>
<br/>
My response is: there will be updates, and I'm also considering a second live broadcast.<br/>
<br/>
But my main focus has always been on writing the book well.<br/>
<br/>
After the book was released in June, I struggled to adapt to the workload.<br/>
<br/>
My energy and time are very limited, so I can only prioritize the main tasks and let go of the minor ones.<br/>
<br/>
My plan for July is to maintain normal updates with two chapters per day, allowing me to adapt to this work schedule and prepare myself.<br/>
<br/>
In July, the first volume will reach its climax.<br/>
<br/>
In August, I aim to significantly increase the number of updates.<br/>
<br/>
At that time, I will give it my all! (I also want to push myself hard and see where my limits lie.) I hope everyone can vote for **Xiangong Kaiwu** with your monthly tickets. <br/>
<br/>
This is very important for both me and my new book Mysteries of the Immortal Puppet Master!<br/>
<br/>
Everyone, please support me! (Bows)<br/>
<br/>
Let's continue this journey together.</div>
