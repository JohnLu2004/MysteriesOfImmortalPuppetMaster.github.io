<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
Ning Zhuo sensed the situation turning dire and shifted into a defensive stance.<br/>
<br/>
Frost Fist!<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou's left fist, carrying a bone-chilling cold, shot toward Ning Zhuo’s chest with lightning speed.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo quickly crossed his arms in front of him to block.<br/>
<br/>
Thud.<br/>
<br/>
With a muffled sound, Ning Zhuo was forced several steps back.<br/>
<br/>
Although Ning Zhuo had blocked the punch, the force of Han Zhou’s fist still penetrated through his defense, and the bitter cold energy seeped into his body.<br/>
<br/>
Bitter Cold Qi!<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou pressed the attack, changing his stance and raising his left leg high, spinning into a powerful kick.<br/>
<br/>
Old Frost Leg!<br/>
<br/>
The leg’s cutting wind aimed directly at Ning Zhuo’s face. Ning Zhuo narrowly dodged to the side, avoiding it by a hair’s breadth, but Han Zhou swiftly changed his move, and his right fist, like a bolt of lightning, struck Ning Zhuo’s ribs.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo’s stance faltered, his frame suddenly loosened.<br/>
<br/>
If it were before his special training, he would have likely started losing the fight at this point. However, after the recent intense training, Ning Zhuo steeled himself, gritting his teeth and maintaining his posture despite the impact, never allowing his defenses to fully collapse.<br/>
<br/>
Each of Han Zhou’s strikes was powerful, numbing Ning Zhuo’s arms.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, Han Zhou ducked and swept his right leg.<br/>
<br/>
Old Frost Leg!<br/>
<br/>
The sweeping kick hit Ning Zhuo’s legs, knocking him off balance and sending him stumbling backward.<br/>
<br/>
Seizing the opportunity, Han Zhou followed up with both fists, one aimed at Ning Zhuo’s face and the other at his chest.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo managed to defend against the attack aimed at his head, but his chest took the full brunt of the blow, and he was sent flying.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was thrown back nearly a dozen feet, but while in midair, he adjusted his posture. By the time he landed, his feet skidded across the ground, preventing him from being thrown to the floor.<br/>
<br/>
“Good strikes.” Ning Zhuo spat out a mouthful of blood, but still smiled at Han Zhou, praising him sincerely.<br/>
<br/>
Watching from the crowd, Lin Shanshan’s brows furrowed as she saw Ning Zhuo coughing up blood, her heart tightening with worry.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong, also observing the battle, laughed teasingly: "Little Zhuo, you really need to train your martial arts harder."<br/>
<br/>
As a tough mentor, Sun Lingtong, a cultivator from the Gan Sect, didn’t consider a bit of blood a big deal.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou, now walking slowly toward Ning Zhuo, shook his head in disappointment. "Fellow Daoist Ning, if this is the extent of your abilities, then the victor today will undoubtedly be me."<br/>
<br/>
"Your close combat skills need work. This weakness is too obvious and will be exploited by others in the future."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo nodded. "Brother Han Zhou, you are right. Close combat has been my training focus these past few days. It was even worse before."<br/>
<br/>
"Thank you, Brother Han Zhou, for helping me refine my techniques.”<br/>
<br/>
"But now, I will use some of my real strength. Please be careful!"<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou's eyes lit up. "I’m ready. Show me what you've got!"<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, Ning Zhuo pulled out six mechanical floating hands from his storage belt.<br/>
<br/>
The floating hands immediately flew into the air, circling Han Zhou.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took a deep breath and began unleashing a barrage of five-element spells.<br/>
<br/>
Flames, golden blades, vines, earth spikes, and water waves—he cast spell after spell, a violent barrage of magic converging in a dazzling display like the brilliant fireworks of a grand festival.<br/>
<br/>
The spectators were in an uproar.<br/>
<br/>
"Who would've thought Ning Zhuo had such mastery over five-element spells? And he's so young!"<br/>
<br/>
"Did he start training in spells from the moment he was born?"<br/>
<br/>
"No, these aren’t just simple five-element spells. He’s rotating them, making them interact, mutually reinforcing and counteracting each other, fully utilizing the power of each spell. What kind of technique is this that allows him to switch between elements so seamlessly?"<br/>
<br/>
Even Lin Shanshan, who knew a little about Ning Zhuo, was now deeply shocked.<br/>
<br/>
Only now did she realize that on the first day of training, Ning Zhuo had held back a lot of his power in front of her.<br/>
<br/>
"So, is he going all out?" Lin Shanshan's eyes were locked on the young man in white, his focused, handsome face illuminated by the multicolored light of his spells, making him even more captivating.<br/>
<br/>
For a moment, Ning Zhuo’s spell-casting figure was deeply etched into Lin Shanshan's heart.<br/>
<br/>
Not just her, but the audience was also amazed and began to remember Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
"His hand-to-hand combat may be weak, but his spell mastery is truly profound!"<br/>
<br/>
"With this level of power, there's no way that cave number 281 is the limit for him."<br/>
<br/>
"He deserves a better cave dwelling."<br/>
<br/>
"Wait, you seem to be forgetting something: Han Zhou’s bitter cold energy."<br/>
<br/>
"Ning Zhuo is only in the early stage of Foundation Establishment, while Han Zhou is in the late stage. As long as Han Zhou can hold out, Ning Zhuo won’t be able to outlast him in terms of spiritual power."<br/>
<br/>
Many spectators saw the situation clearly.<br/>
<br/>
Even though Ning Zhuo was pouring all his effort into casting spells, suppressing Han Zhou and forcing him to defend, this kind of relentless assault was consuming an enormous amount of his spiritual power.<br/>
<br/>
With his early Foundation Establishment cultivation, Ning Zhuo’s reserves were no match for Han Zhou, who was in the late stage.<br/>
<br/>
As expected, as time passed, Ning Zhuo’s energy quickly waned, and his five-element barrage dwindled.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou, who had been enduring the onslaught, finally found an opportunity to strike back.<br/>
<br/>
Whoosh!<br/>
<br/>
An intense cold aura erupted from Han Zhou’s body, greatly weakening the power of Ning Zhuo’s spells.<br/>
<br/>
Like a sharp blade flying out from an icy wasteland, Han Zhou closed the distance to Ning Zhuo in an instant!<br/>
<br/>
“Ah!” Lin Shanshan couldn’t help but cry out.<br/>
<br/>
The spectators around her also gasped.<br/>
<br/>
However, Lin Bufan, watching from afar, saw Lin Shanshan’s reaction and felt a subtle sense of unease.<br/>
<br/>
The overwhelming bitter cold qi enveloped Ning Zhuo, as if he were trapped in an endless snowstorm. His entire body and mind were about to be frozen, and he could only watch as Han Zhou’s fingers thrust toward his forehead.<br/>
<br/>
If that strike landed, it would pierce through his skull, leaving him gravely injured or even on the brink of death!<br/>
<br/>
But at the critical moment, Han Zhou deliberately shifted his strike, aiming instead for Ning Zhuo’s shoulder.<br/>
<br/>
However, his confident attack was suddenly deflected by a protective barrier of slick light that appeared around Ning Zhuo, causing Han Zhou to miss his target entirely.<br/>
<br/>
Slippery Oil Talisman!~<br/>
<br/>
This was a protective talisman given to Ning Zhuo by his elders, and it wasn’t just a one-time use item.<br/>
<br/>
Sensing the danger Ning Zhuo was in, the talisman activated automatically, successfully shielding him from Han Zhou’s attack.<br/>
<br/>
The crowd fell silent for a moment, then erupted into chaos.<br/>
<br/>
"Did I sense that correctly?"<br/>
<br/>
"A Golden Core level talisman?!"<br/>
<br/>
"With a defensive talisman like that, who can even threaten Ning Zhuo?"<br/>
<br/>
"If he had used that from the start, the fight would have been over already!"<br/>
<br/>
Some people were left speechless.<br/>
<br/>
If Ning Zhuo had revealed the talisman at the beginning, the battle would have ended long ago.<br/>
<br/>
No one would have thought Han Zhou stood a chance!<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou, a beggar by birth and dressed in rags, relied solely on his techniques and skills. Even other cultivators with powerful artifacts would struggle to break through a Golden Core-level defensive talisman.<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou, aware of his own limits, scanned Ning Zhuo and realized that the talisman had considerable durability.<br/>
<br/>
He sighed and voluntarily conceded the match.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, however, responded, "I must apologize. I used a protective talisman from my elders, which was not my intention. But your strength, Brother Han Zhou, was such that I could no longer suppress the talisman from activating."<br/>
<br/>
"This victory doesn’t belong to my own strength. How about we call this match a draw?"<br/>
<br/>
Han Zhou carefully examined Ning Zhuo’s sincerity but shook his head. “Victory is victory, and defeat is defeat. The talisman and artifacts you possess are part of your strength. It’s perfectly reasonable to rely on them for victory.”<br/>
<br/>
“I’ve lost this battle!”<br/>
<br/>
With that, Han Zhou saluted, turned, and walked out of the arena.<br/>
<br/>
“We won!” Lin Shanshan clenched her fists instinctively, her heart leaping with joy.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo, however, sighed, his excitement dimmed, and he too left the arena.<br/>
<br/>
The spectators began discussing the match, many of whom were regulars on Little Contention Peak. They had already started evaluating Ning Zhuo’s combat abilities.<br/>
<br/>
"As expected of a noble scion of a great family, carrying a Golden Core-level talisman. Who could threaten him?"<br/>
<br/>
"Only someone like Lai Wuying might stand a chance."<br/>
<br/>
"Ordinary cultivators wouldn’t be able to compete. His spell mastery alone was enough to injure Han Zhou."<br/>
<br/>
Lin Bufan withdrew his gaze. As he left, he saw Lin Shanshan walking over to Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
“A Golden Core-level talisman... Ning family from Fire Persimmon Immortal City, is it?” Lin Bufan began to take Ning Zhuo seriously.<br/>
<br/>
Even though Ning Zhuo was a junior, his background was impressive. Carrying a Golden Core-level talisman showed he was well cared for and a focus of cultivation within his family.<br/>
<br/>
If even Lin Bufan was now paying attention to Ning Zhuo, it was clear that others would take notice too.<br/>
<br/>
Soon enough, news of Ning Zhuo spread throughout Myriad Medicine Valley. Everyone now knew there was a scion of a prestigious family with deep connections—someone not to be easily provoked!</div>
