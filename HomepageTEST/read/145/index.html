<div id="chapterContent"><br/>
The Lava Immortal Palace was under siege.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit, driven to madness by the intense flames within, roared and spewed fire throughout the main hall.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui struggled to suppress it, not daring to take a single step beyond the boundary.<br/>
<br/>
The Scarlet Flame Demon Beasts had not been repelled and continued their relentless assault on the Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
The battle atop the mountain was complex and challenging, making Meng Kui's task even more arduous.<br/>
<br/>
But there was no choice.<br/>
<br/>
As the current City Lord of Fire Persimmon Immortal City, it was his duty to ensure the Lava Immortal Palace remained secure.<br/>
<br/>
He could only endure the hardship.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, within the trial grounds, all was calm and serene.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo looked at Sun Lingtong's soul and tilted his wooden head slightly. "Does this count as a success?" he wondered.<br/>
<br/>
On one hand, Sun Lingtong's soul had indeed been drawn in.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, there were reasons to doubt it.<br/>
<br/>
Typically, when a trial disciple first entered Room One, their soul would reside within the initial wooden puppet torso.<br/>
<br/>
They would then use the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique to attract other mechanical components and assemble their puppet body.<br/>
<br/>
However, Sun Lingtong's soul floated in mid-air, with no mechanical components responding to it.<br/>
<br/>
A red soul flame surrounded Sun Lingtong's soul, a result of the Phoenix Soul Blood Fragrance Pill he had recently taken to heal his soul.<br/>
<br/>
The red soul fire flickered like a phoenix's tail feathers, containing profound mysteries of rebirth.<br/>
<br/>
"Since you haven't been assigned the initial mechanical components, I'll try to arrange them for you," Ning Zhuo decided.<br/>
<br/>
He selected mechanical body parts and limbs for Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
He first had Sun Lingtong's soul reside in the mechanical torso, then guided and assisted him in assembling his own puppet body.<br/>
<br/>
"So this is what it feels like to become a mechanical puppet? It's really fascinating!" Sun Lingtong exclaimed, looking at his puppet hands, stomping his feet, and jumping around excitedly.<br/>
<br/>
"Let's go. Room One might soon have cultivators' souls entering the Immortal Palace for exploration. It's not very safe," Ning Zhuo urged.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong nodded repeatedly.<br/>
<br/>
Understanding the gravity of the situation, he quickly walked several dozen steps to the first door.<br/>
<br/>
He touched the door but received no information, let alone the three rewards.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's heart sank slightly, knowing this was because Sun Lingtong had entered through unconventional means.<br/>
<br/>
Since he hadn't cultivated the Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique, the trial did not recognize him.<br/>
<br/>
"Let's try my Buddha Heart Demon Seal then," Ning Zhuo thought.<br/>
<br/>
In the next moment, his soul power rapidly depleted, and Sun Lingtong immediately received information.<br/>
<br/>
"Three rewards, which one should I choose... uh," Sun Lingtong began, but the rewards disappeared before he could choose.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo reassured him, "Don't worry, I just stopped using the Life-Hanging Thread."<br/>
<br/>
Of course, this was a lie.<br/>
<br/>
In reality, Ning Zhuo had used the Buddha Heart Demon Seal.<br/>
<br/>
He felt no guilt lying to Sun Lingtong because Sun Lingtong had told him when he was two or three years old that everyone might have secrets they keep to themselves and that it was important to respect others' privacy.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong, understanding Ning Zhuo's intentions, said, "Indeed, this needs to be tested."<br/>
<br/>
The result of the test was that Ning Zhuo needed to use the Buddha Heart Demon Seal each time, combined with the Life-Hanging Thread, to temporarily resolve Sun Lingtong's unregistered status, allowing him to receive the trial rewards.<br/>
<br/>
"That's fantastic!" Ning Zhuo praised. "This way, Brother Sun, you might not need to be listed on the leaderboard." He led the puppet Sun Lingtong through the trials, entering the preparation room.<br/>
<br/>
Sure enough, the leaderboard only showed "Entry Standard" and "Meng Chong."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong looked at "Entry Standard" and gave Ning Zhuo a thumbs up. "Well done, little brother, you really have a knack for this." Ning Zhuo, along with the Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng, led Sun Lingtong through the trials.<br/>
<br/>
They reached the first Buddhist trial.<br/>
<br/>
In the coffin room, Ning Zhuo fully activated the Buddha Heart Demon Seal and the Life-Hanging Thread.<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit roared in anger and sorrow but was bound by its duty to relay the information.<br/>
<br/>
Ai Dasheng was outside, suppressing the Immortal Palace, his breath heavy with exertion.<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong shouted, "Alright, I received the information!" Following Ning Zhuo's previous steps, Sun Lingtong began to act.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, his puppet body scattered on the ground, and his soul returned to his physical body.<br/>
<br/>
In the underground base, he reintegrated the divine sense, mana, and blood essence he had previously extracted.<br/>
<br/>
Following the plan he had discussed with Ning Zhuo, Sun Lingtong placed the Netherworld Ghost God Seal, the Soul-Dispersing Rattle Drum, and the broken Golden Thread Robe back into their respective dantians.<br/>
<br/>
He even broke three leaves from the Ghost Gate Escape Grass and placed them in his lower dantian.<br/>
<br/>
Having completed this step, Sun Lingtong could only wait for Ning Zhuo to pull him back in.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, Ning Zhuo drew his soul back into the palace, placing Sun Lingtong back into his previous puppet body.<br/>
<br/>
With this action, a teleportation circle appeared, bringing Cheng Bai forth.<br/>
<br/>
"We did it!"<br/>
<br/>
"We succeeded!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong celebrated, patting each other on the back.<br/>
<br/>
"Lava Immortal Palace, I will use it to create mechanical constructs!" Golden Blood Battle Ape Da Sheng dragged Cheng Bai to the portal, and Sun Lingtong shouted excitedly.<br/>
<br/>
Standing behind him, Ning Zhuo was his staunchest supporter.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, Ning Zhuo fully activated the Buddha Heart Demon Seal and frantically urged the Life-Hanging Thread.<br/>
<br/>
"Roar—!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit wailed in sorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Meng Kui pressed his lips tightly, struggling to suppress it.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo had used Ai Dasheng before, who, despite having immortal potential, was essentially an elderly fire-melting demon ape at the Foundation Establishment Stage.<br/>
<br/>
This time was different.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai was a legitimate Golden Core Stage cultivator, carrying two magic treasures and three Nascent Soul-level spiritual plant leaves.<br/>
<br/>
The Lava Immortal Palace had bronze, iron, silver, and gold furnaces, each representing different levels of fire furnaces.<br/>
<br/>
To refine immortal-grade materials, the gold furnace had to be used.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, once a gold furnace was used to refine immortal-grade materials, it could only be used once!<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai's talent wasn't extraordinary enough to use the gold furnace, but using the silver furnace was a given.<br/>
<br/>
The problem was that one silver furnace wasn't enough.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng Bai had too many items on him!<br/>
<br/>
The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit had no choice but to reluctantly refine the materials for Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
This was one of the reasons it hated living in the Lava Immortal Palace so much—no freedom.<br/>
<br/>
No matter how unwilling, it had to comply!<br/>
<br/>
Boom, boom, boom...<br/>
<br/>
One silver furnace after another exploded, unable to withstand the strain.<br/>
<br/>
After twenty-one silver furnaces were destroyed, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit finally succeeded in refining a mechanical puppet.<br/>
<br/>
During this time, it breathed a sigh of relief.<br/>
<br/>
The intense focus required for the refining process left it with less energy to cause trouble, reducing the turmoil within the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the mechanical puppet was completed! Despite its extreme reluctance, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit transmitted the mechanical puppet back, delivering it to Sun Lingtong.<br/>
<br/>
The envoy, Cheng Bai!</div>
