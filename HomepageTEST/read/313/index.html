Yang Chanyu said, "You were also eliminated, weren't you?" Sun Lingtong asked, "How are you?"<br/>
<br/>
"Still alive. I didn't expect Zhu Xuanji to be so formidable! In the recent battle, he didn't even exert his full strength," Yang Chanyu replied, still shaken at the mention of Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
"Such a powerful figure is among the top tier of Golden Core cultivators in the world. Among the many Golden Core true disciples of the great sects, most would meet their end at his hands if they truly fought," Sun Lingtong nodded, his face pale. He walked to the window and was astonished to see the many scarlet flame beasts on the street, "I didn't expect the situation outside to deteriorate so rapidly."<br/>
<br/>
Yang Chanyu said, "If this Lava Immortal Palace fails, it will completely collapse, and no one will gain anything." "By then, even escaping will be a problem for us!"<br/>
<br/>
All along, Sun Yang and the others had managed to evade Zhu Xuanji and others by leveraging the geographical advantage of the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
If the Immortal Palace were to disappear, they would be exposed in the volcanic lava, vulnerable to the Nascent Soul-level Meng Kui and the Golden Core-level Zhu Xuanji, with a grim fate awaiting them.<br/>
<br/>
Yang Chanyu, panting heavily, stared at Sun Lingtong, "I'm really worried that after all this effort, it will all be for nothing. Should we retreat first?" Sun Lingtong shook his head, "Ning Zhuo is still in the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities."<br/>
<br/>
"Do you have that much faith in him?" Yang Chanyu raised an eyebrow, "I don't believe a mere Qi Refining cultivator has any trump card that could turn the tables against Zhu Xuanji. Continuing to gamble is unwise!" "Sun Lingtong, we should leave."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong used his hand as a pillow, "Hehe, I trust little Zhuo. Haven't you noticed? He hasn't been eliminated yet." Yang Chanyu showed a hint of surprise.<br/>
<br/>
"Don't worry, I know what I'm doing. I wouldn't bet my life on a losing gamble," Sun Lingtong said confidently on the surface, but he was deeply worried inside.<br/>
<br/>
"little Zhuo, from now on, it's all up to you!" Sun Lingtong sighed deeply in his heart.<br/>
<br/>
Secret Pavilion of Opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
Within the Curved Light Weaving Formation.<br/>
<br/>
The Official Techniques Lock on Rudie Niang had been broken by her.<br/>
<br/>
Once the mechanical little maiden regained her freedom, she lay on the surface of an ice block, anxiously watching the young cultivator inside the ice.<br/>
<br/>
The young cultivator was Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment, his eyes were tightly shut, and he had lost consciousness, falling into a coma state.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, although Ning Zhuo had hidden within the Curved Light Weaving Formation, he was still pierced by the golden light that followed.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the warnings from the mechanical ring, which helped him avoid many fatal attacks, he still fell into a coma due to the severe injuries he sustained in a short period.<br/>
<br/>
However, just before losing consciousness, Ning Zhuo managed to release a pair of mechanical constructs from his storage belt.<br/>
<br/>
Ice Jade Hands!<br/>
<br/>
The Ice Jade Hands contained the spirit of Ning Xiaohui, and through items obtained from Ning Xiaohui's grandmother, Ning Zhuo had pushed its spirit to its full potential.<br/>
<br/>
The Ice Jade Hands performed the Icy Jade Palm technique on Ning Zhuo.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo was frozen within a massive ice block for emergency healing.<br/>
<br/>
What reassured the mechanical little maiden was that Ning Zhuo's aura was becoming increasingly stable and powerful.<br/>
<br/>
The Ice Jade Hands hovered in mid-air, with its palm pressed against the top of the ice block, continuously maintaining the Icy Jade Palm technique.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, Ning Zhuo's eyelids twitched slightly.<br/>
<br/>
He regained consciousness, realizing he had just fallen into a coma and was now inside an ice block, being treated by the Ice Jade Hands.<br/>
<br/>
"The injuries are severe!"<br/>
<br/>
"Until now, I've never suffered such serious injuries."<br/>
<br/>
"However, it was precisely because I fell into a temporary coma that I was judged to have lost the battle, thus deceiving Zhu Xuanji and allowing my feigned death plan to succeed." Ning Zhuo's divine sense spread continuously, penetrating the ice block, "seeing" Rudie Niang, the Ice Jade Hands, and the still-maintained Curved Light Weaving Formation.<br/>
<br/>
In the imperial examination, Ning Zhuo's name was "Entry Standard," while Sun Lingtong used the name "Ning Zhuo."<br/>
<br/>
Sun Lingtong voluntarily conceded, was eliminated, and the name "Ning Zhuo" disappeared from the examination list, but "Entry Standard" remained.<br/>
<br/>
"Supreme Virtuous Water..."<br/>
<br/>
At the critical moment, Ning Zhuo used the last two drops of Supreme Virtuous Water to remove the monitoring methods on him.<br/>
<br/>
This was also one of the key actions that ultimately misled Zhu Xuanji.<br/>
<br/>
"Truly a treasure of the water element's merit."<br/>
<br/>
Even though Ning Zhuo was in a coma state at the time, he could still feel the supreme gentleness and kindness of water. Water has no constant form, yet it embraces all things. As Ning Zhuo was cleansed, his heart was as calm as a mirror, serene like a still lake, as if he were floating in a stream.<br/>
<br/>
"I was in a coma state, with no combat power. The Lava Immortal Palace didn't judge me as eliminated. Is it because I released the Ice Jade Hands and had Rudie Niang, who believed I could recover?" "Or is it that the restrictions of the Lava Immortal Palace have weakened to the point where it can no longer transport cultivators?"<br/>
<br/>
The destruction of the restrictions wasn't a clear-cut process, with distinct stages.<br/>
<br/>
Since the restrictions of the Secret Pavilion of Opportunities were damaged, they hadn't been repaired and continued to deteriorate.<br/>
<br/>
However, it wasn't as drastic as the precipitous decline when the Immortal Palace was heavily damaged before.<br/>
<br/>
It was precisely because of this concern that Ning Zhuo had to fight Zhu Xuanji earlier—he was very worried that Sun Lingtong might really die at Zhu Xuanji's hands.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, at the beginning of the confrontation, Ning Zhuo also hoped for victory on his side. After all, on paper, Ning Zhuo's side had a three-to-one advantage.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, none of them expected Zhu Xuanji to be so formidable!<br/>
<br/>
"I've learned, I've learned," Ning Zhuo reflected deeply within the ice block.<br/>
<br/>
"This is the power of hiding one's strength!"<br/>
<br/>
"In a way, this defeat is because I didn't hide as deeply as Zhu Xuanji."<br/>
<br/>
"Mother was right, I need to hide, to be low-key."<br/>
<br/>
"Look at Zhu Xuanji, he's a noble, a scion of royalty, yet he can hide so well. On the surface, he's a renowned divine constable, but in reality, he has mastered divine abilities like the Golden Mountain Stance and Jade Pillar Posture!" "Compared to him, I have too little to hide, what am I compared to him?" "If it weren't for the help of the boss, I would have been eliminated this time!"<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo felt a lingering fear, taking this battle as a lesson, and decided to emulate Zhu Xuanji in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Crack, crack.<br/>
<br/>
The ice block was covered in cracks and then collapsed with a loud crash.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo regained his freedom, half-kneeling on the ground, then slowly opened his eyes and stood up amidst the ice shards.<br/>
<br/>
Rudie Niang cheered joyfully.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo gave her a slight smile, then looked up.<br/>
<br/>
He secretly activated his divine ability, and a clear thread appeared in his vision.<br/>
<br/>
"The Supreme Virtuous Water didn't wash away the thread."<br/>
<br/>
This thread was naturally the Life-Hanging Thread imposed by the Lava Immortal Palace on the imperial examination cultivators.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's expression suddenly changed, and he bent over, vomiting some fresh blood.<br/>
<br/>
The blood contained many ice shards, with blood and golden light flashing within.<br/>
<br/>
This was the attack inflicted by Zhu Xuanji, eroding Ning Zhuo's body, frozen by the ice block, and finally expelled.<br/>
<br/>
Even now, the golden light within the ice shards remained sharp and piercing.<br/>
<br/>
After expelling the ice shards, Ning Zhuo took a deep breath, feeling fully recovered.<br/>
<br/>
Rudie Niang asked if they should dismantle the Curved Light Weaving Formation, as she was gradually feeling overwhelmed.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo surveyed the surroundings, having made up his mind.<br/>
<br/>
He asked Rudie Niang to hold on for a little longer, then took out a mat, sat cross-legged, and began to regulate his breathing.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, his aura became extremely calm.<br/>
<br/>
The young cultivator's eyes were slightly closed, his fair skin emitting a faint cold light amidst the interplay of light and shadow.<br/>
<br/>
"This is the perfect opportunity."<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo made a decision and officially began the final sprint towards the Foundation Establishment stage!<br/>
<br/>
He took out an array disk from his storage belt.<br/>
<br/>
This array disk was a Foundation Establishment-level artifact from the Zhou family.<br/>
<br/>
Back then, Ning Zhuo voluntarily contributed Night Wind Soft Iron, prompting Zhou Nongying to personally reward him with an array disk, which was this very item.<br/>
<br/>
The Zhou family's long-standing expertise in formations made this array disk superior to those available on the market.<br/>
<br/>
Even though Ning Zhuo could set up a spirit gathering formation himself, it couldn't compare to this meticulously crafted array disk.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately, he infused it with mana, causing the array disk to hover above his head.<br/>
<br/>
The array disk began to rotate slowly, sketching out a three-dimensional formation in mid-air, with tightly coordinated formation patterns.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo then took out spirit stones, placing them at various formation nodes.<br/>
<br/>
The spirit stones began to deplete, converting into spiritual energy, filling the space within the formation.<br/>
<br/>
The spiritual energy accumulated rapidly, forming a mist.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo took a deep breath and began to circulate his cultivation technique.<br/>
<br/>
Lower Dantian—Demonic Blood Vein Technique!<br/>
<br/>
His vital energy was vigorous, his blood qi surged, and for a moment, his aura was like a rolling tide, powerful and imposing.<br/>
<br/>
The blood qi condensed into blood veins, appearing in large patches, quickly covering his entire body in a net-like blood armor.<br/>
<br/>
Not only on the surface, but within his body, the blood veins also spread, protecting his internal organs and attaching to the depths of his bones.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's demonic might was overwhelming.<br/>
<br/>
Middle Dantian—Five Elements Qi Regulation Technique!<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo slowly inhaled and exhaled, the five-colored mana in his qi sea roiling continuously, with a magnificent aura.<br/>
<br/>
The mana gradually expanded, reflecting the surrounding five colors in a cycle, with strict order, balance, and harmony.<br/>
<br/>
The young cultivator exuded an aura of immortality, full of charm.<br/>
<br/>
Upper Dantian—Mirror Platform Spirit Communication Technique!<br/>
<br/>
The divine sea was vast, with divine sense condensing into mirrors, reflecting mirror light, illuminating all directions, and scanning all around.<br/>
<br/>
Ning Zhuo's face showed a compassionate expression, with profound Buddhist intent.<br/>
<br/>
The spiritual energy, dense to the extreme, was absorbed by Ning Zhuo with all his might.<br/>
<br/>
His absorption was so fierce and swift that it formed a vortex of spiritual energy.<br/>
<br/>
The vortex spun faster and faster, rapidly expanding, soon filling the entire space within the spirit gathering formation.<br/>
<br/>
And Ning Zhuo, at the center of the spiritual energy vortex, was filled with spiritual energy throughout his body, with his meridians, limbs, head, and internal organs all being stirred by the spiritual energy.<br/>
<br/>
A qualitative change occurred in an instant.<br/>
<br/>
The lower dantian suddenly changed, with the blood qi flowing like a stream.<br/>
<br/>
Foundation Establishment's first barrier—the essence barrier was passed, as easy as breathing.<br/>
<br/>
The middle dantian then transformed, with the gaseous mana condensing and compressing into a liquid state. In the qi sea, it was as if a gentle rain was falling.<br/>
<br/>
Each "raindrop" was the condensation of more than five times the gaseous mana.<br/>
<br/>
Foundation Establishment's second barrier—the qi barrier was passed, naturally.<br/>
<br/>
The upper dantian's mirror light expanded, illuminating the surroundings with clarity, transforming the world, with divine sense stirring, easily undergoing a qualitative change, transforming into divine consciousness!<br/>
<br/>
Foundation Establishment's third barrier—the divine barrier was passed, naturally.<br/>
<br/>
All three barriers were passed, and the dantians were established! Even better, the three dantians were in harmony, with the aura unified.<br/>
<br/>
Three Sects's Supreme Method!<br/>
<br/>
Three Dantians Foundation Establishment!!<br/>
<br/>
Achieved at this moment!!!<br/>
<br/>
Dong dong dong...<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, the sound of bells echoed throughout the Lava Immortal Palace.<br/>
<br/>
"The Transmission Bell?!"<br/>
<br/>
"Why is it suddenly ringing?"<br/>
<br/>
All the cultivators were astonished.<br/>
<br/>
"Could it be, little Zhuo?" Sun Lingtong had a feeling.<br/>
<br/>
"Three Dantians Foundation Establishment! He succeeded, he succeeded!!!" The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit shouted in the main hall, its face filled with panic.<br/>
<br/>
It had thought that Ning Zhuo, severely injured, would remain weak for a long time, unable to compete for the position of the Lava Immortal Palace's master.<br/>
<br/>
Unexpectedly, Ning Zhuo recovered so quickly and seized this opportunity to ascend, triggering a qualitative change in his cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
He had become a Foundation Establishment stage cultivator!</div>
