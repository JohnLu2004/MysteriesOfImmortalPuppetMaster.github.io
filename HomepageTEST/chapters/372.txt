Chapter 372: Feeding Medicine to Grandma Xi

At the main branch of the Ning family's territory.

In Ning Jiufan's residence, a secret room.

On the bed lay an old and frail Fire Fusion Magic Ape.

Ning Jiufan sat at the edge of the bed, holding a medicine bowl in one hand and a soup spoon in the other, feeding the thick medicinal liquid spoonful by spoonful to the magic ape.

"Come, Grandma Xi, drink this medicine. It will help your injuries heal faster," Ning Jiufan said with a gentle smile and a soft tone.

This Fire Fusion Magic Ape was the one that had many entanglements with Ning Jiufan and was rescued by him in the Lava Immortal Palace. It was at the Nascent Soul level.

The mother ape slightly opened her mouth, allowing Ning Jiufan to pour the medicine into it.

As a beast, its survival instinct was extremely strong. Knowing that the medicine was beneficial, it never refused it.

The mother ape looked into Ning Jiufan's eyes, revealing complex emotions.

On one hand, it was grateful to Ning Jiufan for saving its life. On the other hand, it was also angry at Ning Jiufan for taking advantage of its vulnerability, using spells and magical treasures to forcibly bind it as a servant when it was at its weakest.

Finally, the mother ape's gaze also revealed a lot of affection.

In its life, it had many partners, but Ning Jiufan brought it the most novel and unique feelings, leaving a deep impression.

Especially during this recent period of bed rest and recovery, it received Ning Jiufan's tender care.

This was a taste it had never experienced in its life.

In the world of beasts, it was full of cruel competition, brutality, and ruthlessness.

Before recovering, it never thought it could receive such treatment! It turns out life could be lived this way.

The mother ape's spirit was very weak now.

It was already old and decrepit, with its lifespan coming to an end.

Being able to meet Ning Jiufan in the last moments of its life, it felt lucky.

If it were young or in its prime, being forcibly controlled by a Golden Core level being, it would definitely resist and refuse to submit.

But now, it was thoroughly old, with little spirit left.

It indulged in the tender care woven by Ning Jiufan, enjoying the last beautiful moments of its life.

Ning Jiufan finished feeding the medicine and then took out a handkerchief, gently wiping the corners of the ape's mouth.

He said, "Grandma Xi, I know you don't have much life left."

"But I don't want you to die. I want you to live on!"

As he said this, he held the mother ape's hand: "I know you hate me in your heart for forcibly controlling you, using spells and magical treasures to make you unable to resist."

"I admit I have selfish motives because I want you to stay by my side!"

"These days, as I've been treating your injuries, you should know my sincerity."

"But the effect of this medicine is getting worse and worse. I need to find better medicine to treat your injuries. Many days ago, I sent family members to the Ten Thousand Medicine Sect to seek methods of healing for you."

"Today, I received a letter from this family member."

"There is indeed good medicine there to treat your injuries. Will you come with me?"

The Fire Fusion mother ape, having reached the Nascent Soul level, was quite intelligent. Ning Jiufan also used spiritual sense to communicate, so there was no language barrier.

When Grandma Xi heard there was better medicine, her eyes began to shine.

After Ning Jiufan finished speaking, she nodded eagerly, agreeing.

"That's good. I know you want to be with me too, right?" Ning Jiufan felt quite happy.

Being able to persuade Grandma Xi to act voluntarily was the best scenario.

If he had to use spells and magical treasures to force her, it would work, but it would be too heavy-handed.

On this point, Ning Jiufan's thoughts actually coincided with Ning Zhuo's: don't use force, but win over with emotion.

Having successfully persuaded Grandma Xi, Ning Jiufan entered the Lava Immortal Palace and paid respects to Meng Kui, reporting this matter to him.

Meng Kui knew that the Ning family was backed by the Southern Bean royal family. Although unwilling, he couldn't force the issue. After all, Ning Jiufan was not his subordinate.

Meng Kui could only advise Ning Jiufan to go and return quickly.

It would be best if he returned to Fire Persimmon Mountain before the trap was set up. After all, one more person meant one more chance of success.

Ning Jiufan knew that what Meng Kui wanted to rely on was not so much himself, but Grandma Xi.

It was precisely because of this that Ning Jiufan became more determined to go to the Ten Thousand Medicine Sect.

This was because with the great battle imminent, Grandma Xi had not fully recovered. If he lingered in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, he couldn't stand idly by in the matter of capturing the Ten Thousand Year Fire Essence.

This was because the Ten Thousand Year Fire Essence threatened the safety of the entire Fire Persimmon Immortal City. As a member of the city and a Golden Core cultivator, Ning Jiufan had to shoulder the responsibility of a righteous powerhouse. After all, the Ning family lived in this city.

Ning Jiufan worried that if he took action this time, he might be outmaneuvered by Meng Zhi, and Grandma Xi might be sacrificed.

His ability to control a Nascent Soul level Fire Fusion Magic Ape was due to the support of the Zhu family. The Ning family was now the main force restraining the Meng family.

If Meng Zhi harbored some thoughts and secretly caused Grandma Xi's death in this battle, the Ning family would suffer a great loss!

Therefore, he needed to adjust Grandma Xi's condition to the best possible state.

"The Ten Thousand Medicine Sect is indeed a good place for healing. I didn't expect little Zhuo to run there so quickly."

"He seems to be doing quite well there too."

Ning Jiufan secretly took Grandma Xi and quietly left Fire Persimmon Mountain, heading straight towards the Ten Thousand Medicine Sect.

He was quite familiar with the Ten Thousand Medicine Sect.

Years ago, when the Ning family migrated in large numbers, they left the Ten Thousand Beasts Cave through an underground river and directly entered the Ten Thousand Medicine Sect.

The entire Ning family rested in the Ten Thousand Medicine Sect for a period of time.

This was almost impossible in other sects, but the Ten Thousand Medicine Sect made it happen.

From this point of view, the Ten Thousand Medicine Sect had given the Ning family much important and crucial help.

Therefore, regarding the idea of cooperation between the Ning family and the Ten Thousand Medicine Sect mentioned in Ning Zhuo's letter, Ning Jiufan also learned towards agreeing.

Ning Jiufan had quite a good impression of the Ten Thousand Medicine Sect.

Just as he and the magic ape quietly left, a cultivator entered Fire Persimmon Immortal City with unsteady steps, his feet seemingly floating.

His name was Liu Zhen, and he was the sixth senior brother of Lin Shanshan.

This time, he was sent by the Ten Thousand Medicineâ€™s Sect Master Lin Bufan to gather intelligence about Ning Zhuo.

At noon, Liu Zhen was swaying, in a very poor state. His vision was blurry, his head was dizzy, his lower limbs were weak, and he could only walk by leaning against the wall.

He couldn't see the road clearly, missed grabbing the wall, fell down, and passed out on the spot.

"Oh no, someone has fallen at our courtyard gate!" The servant guarding the main gate exclaimed in surprise.

"Could it be some beggar trying to extort us?"

"Don't talk nonsense. This is the property of the City Lord's mansion!"

"Quick, lend a hand, this cultivator is almost out of breath. Quickly, let Master Sun take a look!"

A while later.

Liu Zhen, who had fainted, slowly regained consciousness.

His vision gradually cleared from blurriness, and he found himself on a sickbed, with a cultivator beside him channeling the fragrance of medicine pills, letting the aroma enter his nostrils.

"Doctor, the kindness of saving my life..." Liu Zhen struggled to speak but was interrupted.

"I know, your surname is Liu, given name Zhen, and you're from the Ten Thousand Medicines Gate," the cultivator treating him said. "You fainted in front of my courtyard gate, and the servants carried you in. I found your token and other belongings on you."

"Thus, I learned your identity."

"Please don't be offended. I'm an alchemist, and treating illnesses is just a side skill. I need to gather as much information as possible to treat the symptoms properly."

Liu Zhen smiled weakly: "Master, please don't worry. Since I'm from the Ten Thousand Medicine Sect, I naturally understand these... principles."

His face was deathly pale, without a trace of blood, his entire body almost reduced to a skeleton, his life force extremely faint.

The alchemist treating him introduced himself: "My surname is Sun, given name Lie. I'm temporarily staying at the Purple Yang Villa. You fell at my doorstep, we must have some fate."

"I observe that your blood and qi are extremely weak, you have dizziness and tinnitus, fatigue, irritability in the five centers, spontaneous sweating yet fear of cold, chills."

"Your complexion is as white as paper, your spirit is withered and weak, your appetite is poor, your tongue is pale, bitter, and white, your pulse is deep, thin, and weak."

"This is clearly a deficiency of kidney essence!"

"Moreover, your eye bags are dark purple to black, your nails and teeth show hidden black lines, your body is cold, with lingering ghost energy."

"You must have encountered a female ghost that sucks human blood essence and yang energy, right?"

Liu Zhen nodded: "Master Sun's eyes are indeed perceptive. That's exactly what happened. That female ghost seduced me into intimacy, continuously for seven days and seven nights, exhausting me to the extreme, creating a deadly feud."

"At the critical moment of life and death, fortunately, I had a protective talisman given by my master, which allowed me to teleport away, thus escaping the clutches of the female ghost."

As he said this, Liu Zhen's face showed lingering fear.

If he hadn't been delayed by the female ghost midway, he would have arrived at Fire Persimmon Immortal City much earlier.

Sun Lie nodded: "It seems my diagnosis is correct. Rest well and take my Eight-Flavor Rehmannia Pills. You should recover some strength quickly."

"However, your essence deficiency is severe. You'll need either top-grade pills or long-term recuperation to fully recover."

Liu Zhen: "I understand. Once I complete my sect's mission and return to the Ten Thousand Medicine Sect, I'll ask my master to help me, which will surely resolve my predicament."

"Master Sun, I will definitely repay this life-saving kindness!"

Sun Lie nodded: "I've long heard of the Ten Thousand Medicine Sect. I was just thinking of leaving Fire Persimmon Immortal City to continue my travels. My next stop will be there then."

Sun Lie actually didn't want to leave yet.

But recently, he had learned of a secret that the City Lord's mansion and Luo Feng had been secretly cooperating for some time.

This made Sun Lie feel uneasy.

Previously, the incident with Han Ming had caused him to have conflicts with the Ghost Cry Sect. Sun Lie didn't dare to gamble on Luo Feng's attitude towards him.

Since the City Lord's mansion in Fire Persimmon Immortal City also seemed unreliable now, Sun Lie's intention to leave became even stronger.

These past few days, he had been packing his things, just about to leave the city, when Liu Zhen "delivered" himself to his door.

Hearing Sun Lie's plan, Liu Zhen's face immediately lit up with joy: "That's great, why don't you come back with me, Master?"

"Alright," Sun Lie nodded, giving Liu Zhen some medicine pills and teaching him how to take them.

Liu Zhen, coming from the Ten Thousand Medicine Sect, also had knowledge of medicine and alchemy. He asked Sun Lie many questions and carefully remembered all the details.

Thus, Liu Zhen temporarily stayed at the Purple Yang Villa.

Three days later, Liu Zhen had recovered enough to walk on his own without needing to lean on walls.

He looked in the mirror and saw himself with a head full of gray hair and a face full of aging signs, no longer having the black hair and vitality of before, which made him hate that female ghost even more.

Liu Zhen began to set about completing his sect's mission.
