Chapter 379: How I Long to Be ravaged by Ning Zhuo Again

But Hua Guzi couldn't continue eating like this!

Ning Zhuo controlled the mechanical fists and feet, unleashing another powerful wave of attacks.

Hua Guzi's spiritual seas churned wildly; it was difficult for her to maintain control over her wood elemental magic to meet his assault head-on. She drew upon all her strength to unleash a Fragrant Flower Tracing Technique.

The mechanical fists and feet missed their target, but they quickly returned to bear down on Hua Guzi once more.

Hua Guzi shrieked, "Great Auntie, I know some martial arts too!"

And she really did know a few moves.

Pow, pow, pow!

Ahhhhh!

The spectators watched as twenty mechanical fists surrounded a young girl, relentlessly pummeling her again and again.

Fists rained down like a violent storm, causing Hua Guzi to scream continuously.

In the end, Ning Zhuo voluntarily ceased his attack.

By now, Hua Guzi's face was bruised, her entire head swelling visibly, looking quite like a pig's snout. Her eyes were swollen shut, yet she reached out with fingers purpled from blows, pointing unsteadily at Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo smiled faintly, then used the mechanical fists to lift her out of the training grounds.

Immediately thereafter, the cultivators present declared that the winner of the match was Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo smiled and bowed to the audience as thanks, then walked up to Hua Guzi and cast healing magic on her before everyone.

After several breaths of time, Hua Guzi returned to normal, but her limbs were ice-cold; she trembled uncontrollably. Ning Zhuo produced a cup of warm autumn wine and offered it to Hua Guzi.

Hua Guzi's pupils contracted sharply at the scent of medicinal alcohol, realizing that this was wine brewed from Gold Core ingredients. But she forced herself to remain upright, teeth chattering. "No-no, I don't want any. I'm not going to..."

Ning Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

He let out a cold harrumph, leaned forward, and grabbed Hua Guzi's tender cheeks with his hands, forcing her mouth open like a cherry blossom petal. Then he poured all the contents of the cup directly into Hua Guzi's mouth without hesitation.

Hua Guzi's entire body jolted violently under Ning Zhuo's forceful actions, caught completely off guard. Without thinking, her throat bobbed, and she swallowed the warm autumn wine.

"Begin cultivating," Ning Zhuo commanded coolly.

Hua Guzi's body shook once more, startled by Ning Zhuo's aggressive stance. Instinctively, she rolled her throat, swallowing the wine down.

Then, as if compelled by some unseen force, Hua Guzi sat down cross-legged, began cultivating, and started treating her own injuries.

Ning Zhuo found himself somewhat surprised.

He hadn't planted a lifeline in Hua Guzi's mind, so he wouldn't have done such a thing in public; there was no need to risk anyone detecting it.

Without this lifeline, Ning Zhuo could no longer use Heart Buddha Demon Seal to sense Hua Guzi's emotions through their bond.

Who could've anticipated that Hua Guzi would obediently follow his orders and cooperate so readily?!

"She refused to admit defeat until mere moments ago, yet now she can bend her will as needed," Ning Zhuo muttered to himself, somewhat bewildered. "How peculiar."

After all, he was merely sixteen years old, and though he had spent the last fourteen years observing human hearts, he had never encountered someone like Hua Guzi before.

Victory!

Ning Zhuo's victory over Hua Guzi was a resounding success. Not only did he instill fear in the cultivators on the little peak of strife, even Lai Wuying and Zheng Xingchen admitted to the strength of his martial prowess.

In this battle, Ning Zhuo confirmed his position among wood elemental fighters and tested the efficacy of his mechanical fists in actual combat.

Finally, when he treated Hua Guzi without hesitation, using a medicinal wine of Gold Core caliber, he secured another wave of favorable reputation points.

Even if some criticized him for putting on airs, having used resources equivalent to those of a Gold Core cultivator demonstrated that he was willing to invest heavily! It was difficult to argue with that.

In no time at all, the little peak of strife was abuzz with discussions about Ning Zhuo.

"I never imagined that Ning Zhuo’s machine techniques would be more powerful than his five elemental magics."

"A true talent from the heavens!"

"First impressions were rather ordinary, but he has hidden talents beneath the surface."

"If I were Ning Zhuo, I'd want to use my machine techniques straight away, crushing everyone underfoot. But instead, he hides and keeps it to himself—what a disappointment."

"What do you mean 'hide and keep to oneself'? This is called humility, this is called keeping a low profile. This is what cultivator clan descendants are like. This is how they conduct themselves."

With real accomplishments laid bare for all to see, many cultivators began boasting on Ning Zhuo's behalf.

"Hmph, these clan descendants clearly could have lived off their family connections, yet they still come begging for scraps alongside us rogue cultivators at Ten Thousand Medicines Sect."

"That's quite improper, especially when speaking of Ning Zhuo. Haven't you heard? This is merely one stop on his journey, and once the time comes, he will leave."

Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong were both adept at spreading rumors, though Ning Zhuo excelled above all else due to his unwavering confidence. With Sun Lingtong's help, he had already begun spreading rumors ahead of time.

Currently, these rumors were proving beneficial to him.

Once everyone realized that Ning Zhuo was merely passing through and not settling down, his immortal's cave would become available again. Many of those who had harbored animosity toward him would be less inclined to dislike him.

"When will he leave?"

"That is unclear."

"I think he actually fits right in on Little Contention."

"He's good-looking, and every time I watch him fight, it's like watching something beautiful!"

"He truly is gentle and elegant. After defeating Hua Guzi, he even fed her some medicinal wine brewed from Gold Core-grade ingredients. Who else has done such a thing?"

Thus, the crowd learned why Ning Zhuo had recovered so quickly after his battle with Han Zhou.

The next day at the training grounds, Han Zhou once again retreated before the combined attacks of twenty-plus machine techniques, calling for a halt.

Unlike before, Ning Zhuo did not seem as satisfied by the end of the session. He felt that this kind of training yielded far fewer spiritual insights than previous sessions, barely enough to account for thirty percent of what he'd gained earlier.

He mulled over the matter privately: "The main reason is because my bout with Hua Guzi gave me ample opportunity to put theory into practice, allowing me to identify many shortcomings."

"Further sparring with Han Zhou will only result in both parties holding back; it won't stimulate me as much."

Ning Zhuo felt increasingly certain that his little peak of strife was truly blessed.

It was because he had gained ample practical experience here, greatly filling in his own deficiencies and making great strides in many areas.

"The benefits I've gleaned from Han Zhou may still exist, but they're no longer sufficient."

"Perhaps it's time to find another partner for these spars."

"Maintain our relationship with Han Zhou, so we can acquire more bitter water to drink."

Ning Zhuo pondered this.

After the end of their training session, he and Han Zhou walked side by side out of the training grounds.

Han Zhou said, "Fellow Daoist Ning Zhuo, why bother treating Hua Guzi after every battle? As far as I see it, wasting Gold Core level medicinal wine is rather unjustified."

Han Zhou seemed somewhat resentful.

This resentment stemmed from when Ning Zhuo had sought him out, asking him to infuse the mechanical strikes with bitter cold energy. At the time, Han Zhou had eagerly agreed.

On one hand, he had long anticipated subjecting others to the brutality of mechanical strikes. On the other, he wanted to use Ning Zhuo as a conduit to inflict bitter cold energy on others, thereby securing additional opportunities to pass on his cultivation.

Yet after the battle, Ning Zhuo had rescued Hua Guzi and driven away her bitter cold energy.

Ning Zhuo smiled faintly and explained to Han Zhou that he didn't want to be overly forceful, bullying a weak woman. He hadn't wished true hostility upon Hua Guzi; their interactions were always meant as sparring sessions.

He'd offered Hua Guzi a cup of warm autumn wine merely to cultivate good karma with her, not wishing to strain his relationship with those around him too much while traveling afar—after all, it's far better to have friends than enemies when you're on the road.

Han Zhou couldn't help but sigh. "Ning Zhuo truly possesses the noble bearing expected of a great clan. But I'm afraid you may not fully understand how Hua Guzi has always been arrogant and eccentric, holding grudges and retaliating against anyone who wrongs her—even more so because she is half-human, half-demon."

"If you treat her thusly, she will not reciprocate your kindness, instead intensifying her hatred toward you and seeking vengeance!"

Ning Zhuo blinked slightly, then quickly displayed a questioning expression. Just as he was about to ask further, something flew toward them from nearby—a lantern.

Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be Hua Guzi, moving forward with her billowing wide skirt fluttering in the wind.

Hua Guzi flew directly toward Ning Zhuo, her gaze fixed on him.

Han Zhou and Ning Zhuo instantly prepared for battle!

"Ning Zhuo, please accept this gift!" However, after arriving before Ning Zhuo, Hua Guzi halted abruptly, bowed deeply, and presented a plate of dumplings with both hands.

Ning Zhuo and Han Zhou were stunned, unsure what Hua Guzi was up to.

Ning Zhuo's guard rose as he mentally scanned these dumplings and Hua Guzi, his first instinct being—could it be that these dumplings have been poisoned?

But then he dismissed this conjecture almost immediately. Even if they had been poisoned, there was no reason for Hua Guzi to poison them in front of him like this.

What exactly was going on with Hua Guzi?

Ning Zhuo assumed that she was experiencing some kind of difficulty and wanted his help. He promptly said, "Fellow Daoist Hua, let us discuss elsewhere."

Unexpectedly, Hua Guzi remained bowing, face still pressed against the ground, without so much as moving an inch. "I beg Young Master Ning Zhuo to accept my token of appreciation!"

Ning Zhuo blinked in surprise.

He sent his consciousness out to scan their surroundings and found that they were alone enough for him to use his trump card.

Divine ability—Thread of Life.

Magical artifact—the Head Buddha Seal!

In the following moment, Ning Zhuo felt many emotions from Hua Guzi.

Hua Guzi dared not lift her head to face Ning Zhuo, so her entire face was red as she lay parallel with the ground.

She roared internally:

"Ahhhhh!"

"Why, why?"

"Dammit, I've finally done it this time!"

"Hua Guzi, what are you doing?"

"You shameless thing! How could you treat a man like this? How could you degrade yourself so much?"

"But, but..."

"I-I feel so good."

"Just being this close to him makes me smell his scent, it's intoxicating!"

"Ning Zhuo is truly a man as delicate as a flower."

"How I long to receive another beating at his hands, to be pummeled by his controlled mechanical fists, then have his hand clamped over my mouth while he feeds me warm medicinal wine."

Ning Zhuo:?!!

Although he could not sense Hua Guzi's clear thoughts, he could sense her surging and distorted emotions.

Ning Zhuo subconsciously took a small step back.

He felt a chill in his heart and looked down at Hua Guzi's petite back.

"What's wrong with this woman?!"
For a moment, Ning Zhuo couldn't figure out what Hua Guzi's intentions might be.

To play it safe, he firmly declined her advances. "There's no need for such things, Fellow Daoist Hua. We're merely exchanging techniques; there's nothing owed between us. Even if it were that warming autumn wine, it was I who chose to offer it, never expecting repayment."
