Chapter 262: Where is the True Mastermind Behind the Scenes?

Almost all the invited guests had arrived, and the presiding elder took the stage.

The crowd quickly quieted down.

Presiding Elder: "Honored guests, today we gather here not only to converse as colleagues and friends but also to celebrate a virtuous act for the common people. Before his death, Old Director Li Leifeng was still concerned about the issue of his successor. Now, it has been most appropriately resolved."

"Lord Zhu Hou, hailing from the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family, is renowned for his benevolence and magnanimity. He will inherit the children's orphanage and take on the role of director. Let us invite Lord Zhu to the stage to share his words of wisdom."

A middle-aged man, broad and stout, with a smile on his face, walked onto the stage.

Today, Zhu Hou was dressed in a satin robe, with a jade pendant at his waist, and his steps were steady.

His every move exuded the grace of the Zhu royal family.

He stood on the stage, cupped his hands in salute, and looked around, letting out a hearty laugh.

"Fellow Daoists, I am truly humbled to assume the position of director of the children's orphanage today. The path of charity is to seek blessings for the common people and to spread benevolence. The benevolent heart of former Director Li Leifeng deeply moves me. Today, I shall carry on his mission and continue to promote this virtuous cause."

"In the future, our orphanage will expand its support to orphans and even impoverished students. The donations from all you benevolent individuals will be used entirely for the benefit of the people, to aid the common folk. Moreover, I am willing to lead by example and donate one hundred thousand spirit stones to express my sincerity!"

Zhu Hou organized this succession ceremony with a clear purpose.

The main goal was to formally make his debut and to raise the first charitable fund since taking office.

As soon as he finished speaking, Zhu Xuanji's voice came from the third floor: "Well said, Uncle Zhu! I, Zhu Xuanji, also donate one hundred thousand spirit stones to congratulate my uncle on his succession." Zhu Xuanji came here with the intention of supporting and endorsing Zhu Hou, and he did not hesitate to act.

His donation amount was interesting, exactly one hundred thousand spirit stones, just like Zhu Hou.

This made the other attendees feel relieved, without any pressure, and instead eager to make their own donations.

However, these people understood the rules and did not immediately speak up.

They were waiting for another person.

The next moment, the Golden Core true disciple of the Purple Dawn Pavilion indeed spoke, announcing a donation of one hundred thousand spirit stones.

As soon as he finished, Foundation Establishment cultivators began to shout eagerly, and the sounds of donations echoed continuously.

For a moment, the eastern part of the building was very lively.

However, the atmosphere inside the private box was oppressive.

Ning Zhuo sat in the position below Zhu Xuanji, and after sitting down, he remained silent, not touching the exquisite spiritual food and tea on the round table even once.

Zhu Xuanji slightly turned his head, his eyes with a hint of golden light staring at Ning Zhuo, smiling: "Seeing this scene now, Ning Zhuo, what do you feel?" Ning Zhuo raised his eyes to look at Zhu Xuanji.

The latter's smile, in Ning Zhuo's perception, seemed like a ferocious beast's gaping maw.

Ning Zhuo felt as if a huge stone was pressing on his heart, but his gaze did not waver.

He calmly spoke: "I naturally hope that Lord Zhu Hou can do as he says. I hope the children's orphanage in Fire Persimmon Immortal City can become better and better." "It will," Zhu Xuanji immediately replied, full of confidence in Zhu Hou.

The smile on his face deepened: "I saw your name in the donation records of the orphanage. You have donated several times in the past. Why not donate a little on such an important day today?" Ning Zhuo took a deep breath.

He tried to calm himself, but the pressure in his heart only increased! Because he knew very well that Zhu Xuanji's seemingly ordinary question concealed a huge threat.

A slight misstep in response could lead him into a trap.

This was the beginning of his confrontation with Zhu Xuanji! The excitement outside had nothing to do with him.

Instead, the noise highlighted his current loneliness and hardship.

Zhu Xuanji was like a skilled assassin, delivering a sword move.

On the surface, it seemed ordinary, but Ning Zhuo was certain that the other party had a brilliant follow-up move.

If he responded incorrectly, one wrong step could lead to complete suppression, with no hope of victory!

Ning Zhuo frowned slightly, his mind racing with thoughts, quickly choosing his words carefully: "To cultivate oneself and benefit the world. Although I am pragmatic, I also have ideals. Moreover, in my childhood, I was under the care of Lord Li Leifeng, to whom I owe a debt of gratitude." Then, Ning Zhuo changed his tone: "Of course, I also have selfish motives. You know, I want to establish my own family."

"I want to build my own clan! I have been working towards this, but for a force to grow, fresh blood and external talents are necessary. Especially for someone like me, who is just starting out, with shallow foundations, the more newcomers, the better! That's why I have been donating in the past. There will be more such donations in the future!"

Ning Zhuo smiled briefly, then immediately became expressionless: "The orphanage's policy is excellent, recruiting many talents for the righteous forces of the Southern Bean Kingdom. I am a member of the Ning family, and I am also part of the righteous path, so of course, I want a share of the love. You see, Lord Zhu, I have paid, which is in line with the rules. As for why I am not donating today? Ha!"

"Today is not suitable. I am currently managing the black market, and my righteous identity is not so glamorous, so I won't be the one to spoil this atmosphere. If I want to donate, I can do it secretly in the future and still achieve my goals. Why do something so unpopular?"

After hearing Ning Zhuo's response, Zhu Xuanji fell into a brief silence.

Ning Zhuo's desire to establish his own family and build his own force was something Zhu Xuanji was well aware of.

Ning Zhuo had brought up this matter multiple times in front of him, even daring to speak to his own Golden Core ancestor, Ning Jiufan, in such a manner.

Even Zhu Xuanji admired Ning Zhuo's courage.

To be precise, he admired him greatly.

Especially after hearing Ning Zhuo's response, he gained a deeper understanding of Ning Zhuo—this young man had definitely been tempered by experience! He was well-versed in the rules of the righteous path's game, and despite his youth, he was as cunning and seasoned as an old fox.

He had very clear goals, cared about others' feelings, and could empathize.

Ning Zhuo was both hypocritical and sincere.

This kind of hypocrisy of the righteous path, when placed on this young boy, actually had a certain charm.

Ning Zhuo's response was excellent.

This answer increased Zhu Xuanji's favorable impression of him significantly.

Zhu Xuanji laughed heartily, breaking the silence: "Even with selfish motives, as long as you know gratitude and repay kindness, it is the righteous path. In this world, who doesn't have selfish motives? Even I, who constantly observes the people's sentiments, investigates cases, and pursues criminals, do so partly to protect the royal family."

"Ning Zhuo, you have a good nature, act righteously, and have a bright future. However, in life, there are countless wrong paths. I have seen many inherently kind people who, due to a moment's lapse, took the wrong path and committed sins. By the time they regretted it, it was already too late."

At this point, Zhu Xuanji stared at Ning Zhuo, his face solemn.

Without using any magical power, he exuded a strong oppressive force through his tone and demeanor.

Ning Zhuo took a deep breath, avoiding eye contact, as if a bolt of lightning flashed through his mind.

He quickly discerned Zhu Xuanji's intention: "Is he trying to recruit me?"

Realizing this, Ning Zhuo's heart became lively. "If Zhu Xuanji had discovered I was the mastermind, he wouldn't treat me like this but would capture me directly!"

"Based on his character, he must have found some suspicious points about me but wants to use me as a lead to catch the real culprit behind the scenes!" But where is there a real culprit behind the scenes?

Ning Zhuo was the one who orchestrated the explosion at the Lava Immortal Palace, set up the trial checkpoints, initiated the city battle to kill Cheng Bai, framed his own family's genius Ning Xiaohui, directed the Golden Core melee, bombarded the volcano leading to the demon beast tide attacking the city, and planned the cloud merchant robbery case!

"I hold great value in Zhu Xuanji's eyes, and he wants to turn me. If there truly were a mastermind, he might even use me as a witness." "So, has it reached the third line of defense?" Ning Zhuo's emotions fluctuated.

To compete for the Lava Immortal Palace, he had meticulously crafted several lines of defense.

The first line of defense was from opening four cores at the age of two, continuously creating various pieces of evidence scattered throughout his growth trajectory.

Investigators would conclude that Ning Zhuo had a talent for mechanical constructs, making it reasonable for him to develop mechanical fire monkeys and the like.

The second line of defense was the identity of Chui Xu Ke.

The third line of defense would make them believe Ning Zhuo was being used, a secondary accomplice, but not the mastermind.

After all, this young man was only sixteen, just out of school, and only at the mid-stage of Qi Refining.

Ning Zhuo slightly relaxed, the situation hadn't deteriorated to the final step—using force to confront Zhu Xuanji directly. "But what clues did Zhu Xuanji obtain to bypass the second line of defense and reach the third?" Ning Zhuo couldn't figure out the answer to this question.

He could only speculate: "Did Han Ming get captured? Did Sun Lingtong's treasure theft lead to clues from the cloud merchants?" "Or... the children's orphanage?"

Lacking critical information, even with his considerable intellect, Ning Zhuo couldn't ascertain the truth.

He thought intensely, sweat appearing on his forehead.

Zhu Xuanji, seeing his embarrassed state, didn't let him off, pressing further: "What insights do you have about my earlier words, Ning Zhuo?" "Do you think your path is the right one or a wrong path?" Ning Zhuo felt immense pressure!

At this moment, he felt as if Zhu Xuanji had thrust a sword to his throat.

How to respond? This was crucial!

To probe? A slight misstep could anger Zhu Xuanji.

To remain silent? That would completely relinquish initiative, conveying tacit agreement to Zhu Xuanji.

In Ning Zhuo's mind, countless ineffective thoughts arose and vanished rapidly.

In just a few breaths, he felt parched.
