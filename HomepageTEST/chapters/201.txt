Chapter 201: Earth Fiend Fire

Fire Persimmon Mountain.

In the Broad Ape Fruit Cave.

Within the cave of the Nascent Soul-level Demon Ape, the icy mist gradually dissipated.

Ning Jiufan slowly floated out from the thinning icy mist.

Seeing this scene, the Golden Core cultivators present were all excited.

"He’s out, he’s out!" Zheng Shuangjun shouted.

The four Golden Core cultivators from the Zhou and Zheng families gathered around, expressing their gratitude and concern.

His face was as pale as gold paper, his lips white, his entire being drained, like a piece of paper fluttering in the wind, extremely weak.

"Brother Ning, you’ve really worked hard this time!" Zhu Xuanji was the first to step forward, immediately supporting Ning Jiufan.

Ning Jiufan's body was still trembling slightly.

He looked at Zhu Xuanji with vacant eyes, his eye sockets red, a mix of sorrow and joy as if he had survived a great ordeal.

Zhu Xuanji also observed Ning Jiufan, seeing the sunken eye sockets and cheeks of the latter, he couldn't help but be secretly shocked: "How long has it been!"

Their words were completely heartfelt.

If it weren’t for Ning Jiufan standing at the forefront, one of them might have become a sacrificial offering.

"Brother Ning, your righteousness! Your sacrifice and dedication this time will be remembered by all of us for life!" "You saved us all. This is a life-saving grace, and we will definitely repay it in the future."

Ning Jiufan sighed deeply: "I was also saving myself. After this battle, I hope that in the future, we can advance and retreat together, united in building a bright future." All the Golden Core cultivators nodded in agreement.

Ning Jiufan's great sacrifice elevated his status among the Golden Core cultivators, earning him immense influence!

Zheng Shuangjun took out a portion of Nine Yang Yellow Ox Balm.

He concernedly said to Ning Jiufan, "Brother Ning, you are extremely weak now, you should use some of our Zheng family's top-grade elixirs." Unexpectedly, Ning Jiufan's eye twitched fiercely upon seeing the Nine Yang Yellow Ox Balm.

He suppressed his nausea, waving his hand repeatedly: "No, no, don’t let me see that elixir." "Alright, alright!" Zheng Shuangjun quickly put the balm away.

The Golden Core cultivators immediately understood that Ning Jiufan's injuries were not just physical but also psychological.

His sacrifice was truly immense!

This made everyone admire Ning Jiufan even more, generating a stronger sense of compensation.

Next, everyone took out various miraculous elixirs, giving them to Ning Jiufan, almost feeding him water and medicine by hand.

The various miraculous elixirs had excellent effects, quickly stabilizing Ning Jiufan's aura.

Roar!

At this moment, the Nascent Soul-level Fire Fusion Demon Ape suddenly let out a low roar.

The overwhelming Nascent Soul-level aura made all the Golden Core cultivators and the Fire Fusion Demon Ape King outside the cave pause.

By now, the icy mist had completely dissipated.

The Nascent Soul-level Fire Fusion Demon Ape looked satisfied, it lay back down, its eyelids slowly closing.

Before falling asleep, it extended a finger, shooting out a stream of blood energy.

The blood energy, like a meteor chasing the moon, moved extremely fast, and in the blink of an eye, it landed on Ning Jiufan's forehead, marking a red mole between his brows.

After completing this step, the Fire Fusion Demon Ape completely closed its eyes, falling into a deep sleep.

Soon, it began to snore.

Ning Jiufan hurriedly reached out, touching his forehead, feeling the extremely condensed and stubborn blood energy, difficult to remove, his expression became very unsightly.

It was clear that the Nascent Soul-level female ape had completely taken a liking to him, marking him with its unique sign.

What was he supposed to do in the future?

The other Golden Core cultivators stared at the red mole on Ning Jiufan's forehead, each with a look of shock and astonishment, their hearts filled with intense fear and relief.

Zhu Xuanji quickly transmitted his voice to comfort Ning Jiufan, promising to do his utmost to help him.

The other Golden Core cultivators also expressed that Ning Jiufan's problem was everyone's problem! They would definitely assist him with all their might in the future.

At this moment, the Fire Fusion Demon Ape King, accompanied by several Golden Core-level Demon Apes, walked into the cave.

The atmosphere inside the cave immediately became tense.

Zhu Xuanji stepped forward, standing in front of Ning Jiufan, facing the numerous Golden Core-level Fire Fusion Demon Apes.

However, the Fire Fusion Demon Apes, who had been roaring with anger and fighting to the death not long ago, showed no signs of battle intent.

Seeing the human Golden Core cultivators on high alert, they took a few steps back, raising their hands to indicate they had no intention of fighting.

Then, the Fire Fusion Demon Ape King pointed at Ning Jiufan, then raised its palm, letting out a series of roars.

The several Golden Core-level Demon Apes behind it also clapped, gesticulating wildly, their faces full of admiration, with some even showing looks of worship.

The human Golden Core cultivators looked at each other, then focused their gazes on Ning Jiufan.

Ning Jiufan's face turned even more unsightly!

The admiring gazes of the Fire Fusion Demon Apes, along with the clapping, felt like slaps on his face, making him extremely embarrassed and annoyed.

Zhu Xuanji and the others tried to keep a straight face, some frowning, some biting their tongues, some tensing their muscles.

After clapping for a while, the Fire Fusion Demon Ape King pointed at Ning Jiufan again, then pointed at the cave entrance.

It repeated this gesture three times, then led the Golden Core-level Demon Apes out of the cave.

The human Golden Core cultivators understood its meaning—it was inviting them out.

Zhu Xuanji took the lead, walking at the forefront.

The Zheng and Zhou family cultivators guarded Ning Jiufan, the great hero, in the middle of the group.

The human Golden Core cultivators walked out of the cave, arriving at the previous battlefield.

The Fire Fusion Demon Ape King waved its hand at the gathered Demon Apes, then let out a roar.

The Foundation Establishment-level Demon Apes scattered.

Soon, only the Golden Core-level ones remained.

The Fire Fusion Demon Ape King suddenly pounded its belly, then vomited out a stone ball.

It then grabbed the stone ball, with a reluctant expression, and handed it to Ning Jiufan.

The legendary scene of the Demon Ape tribe rewarding a hero had occurred!

Zhu Xuanji's eyes flashed with golden light, immediately recognizing the stone ball, his expression stunned: "This is a Fire Core Pomegranate. Each pomegranate seed is an explosive talisman, capable of unleashing an attack comparable to a full-strength strike of an ordinary Golden Core." "But using it this way would be a waste!"

"The pomegranate seeds can be used as fire cores, combined with other suitable fuels, to preserve special fire seeds.

"I've never seen such a large pomegranate before. Even the royal treasury doesn't have such high-quality Fire Core Pomegranates." Without a doubt, this was an extremely rare heavenly material and earthly treasure.

Upon hearing Zhu Xuanji's explanation, Ning Jiufan immediately reached out to take the pomegranate. After inspecting it, he took out a talisman, sticking it on the pomegranate's surface, then placed the pomegranate into his storage belt.

Zhou Nongying couldn't help but feel fortunate: "I didn't expect the Ape King to have such a trump card. It seems we were lucky to avoid a deadly battle with the Fire Fusion Demon Ape King by accidentally entering the cave."

The two Golden Core cultivators from the Zheng family stared at the pomegranate, their gazes glued to it.

They communicated privately: "These pomegranate seeds can be used in many ways for refining artifacts." "Indeed, I've already thought of at least thirty uses. Its effects must be excellent!"

After giving the pomegranate, the Fire Fusion Demon Ape King called out a few times.

Three Golden Core-level subordinates immediately turned and left.

After a dozen breaths, they returned.

The leading Fire Fusion Demon Ape was holding a massive flame with both arms.

The flame was as large as a carriage, primarily deep red, but occasionally flickered with black. At the tip of the flame, black smoke often emanated.

"Earth Fiend Fire!"

"Such a large flame, it's a Nascent Soul-level resource!" The cultivators exclaimed.

Earth Fiend Fire not only had terrifying firepower and emitted high temperatures at all times, but it also possessed the intense toxicity of fire fiend.

It had limited use in alchemy, mainly for refining fire poison pills.

But it could be used for artifact refining.

This flame alone surpassed the capabilities of the Zheng family's top-tier artifact refining room in some aspects.

The two Golden Core cultivators from the Zheng family were mesmerized.

This flame was extremely tempting to them!

The Fire Fusion Demon Apes had no cultivation techniques, relying on their natural physical growth and constant tempering in nature to reach Golden Core-level combat power.

They had no spells to isolate the high temperature of the Earth Fiend Fire, only their special body structure to withstand it.

The Golden Core-level Demon Ape carrying the Earth Fiend Fire gradually couldn't bear it, its hands getting scorched, forcing it to pass the flame to its companion.

The companion carried it for a while, but also couldn't endure, its hands getting burnt, so it passed the flame to the third companion.

Thus, the three Golden Core-level Fire Fusion Demon Apes took turns, finally delivering the Earth Fiend Fire to Ning Jiufan.

This time, Ning Jiufan used thirteen talismans in succession to barely seal the Earth Fiend Fire.

Under the eager gazes of the two Golden Core cultivators from the Zheng family, Ning Jiufan stored the Earth Fiend Fire.

Zhu Xuanji couldn't hold back, coughed, and transmitted his voice to Ning Jiufan: "Brother Ning, don't forget our main objective for this trip."

Thus, when the Fire Fusion Demon Ape King was about to continue giving treasures, Ning Jiufan took the initiative to point at the pile of spoils, indicating the mechanical demon general.

The Fire Fusion Demon Ape King tilted its head, somewhat puzzled, but after Ning Jiufan insisted, it still pulled out the mechanical demon general and handed it to Ning Jiufan.

The gifts from the Demon Apes were far from over.

The Ape King gave six more significant gifts, rewarding Ning Jiufan.

After that, the Demon Apes began to see them off.

Zhu Xuanji achieved his goal and had no motivation to stay in such a dangerous environment, so he immediately led the Golden Core cultivators out of the Demon Ape's lair.

They retraced their steps, reaching the volcano's peak, and once again met Meng Kui.

Although Meng Kui was in the mountain's smoke and clouds, he had observed much of what happened inside Fire Persimmon Mountain.

Seeing the cultivators return, his expression remained indifferent, but he felt a great sense of loss.

This trip, the Golden Core cultivators had thrilling yet safe experiences, with no casualties, dashing many of Meng Kui's hopes.

Ning Jiufan held onto the mechanical demon general, not handing it over to Zhu Xuanji immediately.
