Chapter 216: Confession Letter and Victory Report

The three Golden Core Stage cultivators finally understood the deeper meaning behind Zhu Xuanji's every move.

Zhu Xuanji had done it on purpose.

He wanted the City Lord's Mansion to know that Ning Zhuo had been exposed!

By seizing this clue, Zhu Xuanji effectively grabbed the City Lord's Mansion by the tail, forcing them to eliminate Ning Zhuo, thereby exposing an even greater flaw.

"I have a question," Zheng Shuangjun said. "If I were Fei Si and failed to attack Ning Zhuo once, I would definitely attack a second time. Why keep Ning Zhuo around until now?"

Zhu Xuanji explained, "From my current investigation, after Ning Zhuo was attacked, his residence was destroyed, so he moved into the Ning family estate. Our three families' genius cultivators were also attacked, and I remember we invited Lord Zhu to investigate at that time. The City Lord's Mansion must have been wary of Lord Zhu's abilities and felt the situation was too tense, so they temporarily stopped. This is quite normal."

Zhu Xuanji continued, "I did gather various clues, but they were similar to my investigation of the Mechanical Fire Bamboo Snake. They were meant to confuse me and divert my attention. So, I didn't continue following those leads but instead designed a list for investigation, checking each one."

"Ning Zhuo gradually stood out, becoming more exceptional. The City Lord's Mansion found it harder to act against him. To conceal their true intentions, they couldn't just assassinate him alone, or it would be too easy for me to trace back to them. However, looking back now, there might be another reason."

"Ning Zhuo is good at maneuvering and has always actively approached Fei Si. He has shown his talent but is not well-received, being pushed aside by the main branch of the Ning family. Such an identity is actually quite valuable for recruitment. The City Lord's Mansion might have seen this."

"They might have thought that my focus was on the investigation list, and since the investigation had moved away from their critical points, they didn't rush to act but instead saw Ning Zhuo as a potential pawn to cultivate. Ning Zhuo is just a small figure, not the main focus; he was merely being used."

"The key now is that I discovered the suspicion on him, grabbing the City Lord's Mansion by the tail. If the City Lord's Mansion insists on assassinating Ning Zhuo, it will expose their flaw, giving us a perfect opportunity. This is why I gathered you all here."

"Last time, we explored the Fire Persimmon Mountain and the Fire Fusion Demon Ape King's court together. This time, let's deal with the City Lord's Mansion together!" The three Golden Core Stage cultivators' eyes sparkled with excitement.

"Indeed, this is a great opportunity!" Zheng Danlian was the first to nod.

Zheng Shuangjun clenched his fists and said, "Yes, yes." He was the most excited among everyone present.

"If the Meng family makes a big mistake, Lord Zhu will have a legitimate reason to request the Southern Bean Kingdom's royal family's power to suppress the situation. We might not even need to use the royal family's power. Meng Kui himself, under irrefutable evidence, will surrender unless he wants to rebel!" The real crime of the Shuang family was not killing Ai Dasheng and stealing the Demonic Gate's true scripture but using Ning Zhuo to blow up the Immortal Palace!

The Shuang family, for their own benefit, put the entire Fire Persimmon Immortal City and its countless citizens at risk.

They also created a Shadow Demon Cultivator to attack the Lava Immortal Palace, showing their great ambition to raise bandits for their own gain.

Such crimes completely crossed the line.

Zheng Shuangjun expressed his intention to follow Lord Zhu and take action against the City Lord's Mansion.

Zheng Shuangjun was furious.

He realized he had been kept in the dark.

His battle with the Shadow Demon Cultivator was entirely within the City Lord's Mansion's calculations.

The two Golden Core Stage cultivators of the Zhou family secretly communicated, discussing for a while.

They both felt this was indeed a good opportunity.

If they could bring down the Meng family, Zhu Xuanji could leverage the royal family's power to establish dominance and become the master of the Lava Immortal Palace.

"The Meng family, for their own expansion, broke the rules. Fortunately, Lord Zhu saw through it and collected enough evidence to reveal the truth to the world."

"At that time, we will have the moral high ground, gaining widespread recognition throughout the Southern Bean Kingdom. Even other families will unite with the royal family against the Meng family. Even if they don't unite, they will stand by and watch." Public opinion is a powerful force.

Once the Meng family's mistakes are exposed, the royal family can ride the wave of public opinion.

Under the pressure of public opinion, the Meng family will find it hard to resist!

"If this happens, the Meng family, such a giant, will be severely weakened by us." Zhu Xuanji was filled with anticipation.

Weakening and striking these large cultivation families had always been his political ambition!

This gave him great motivation for the upcoming actions.

Seeing the Zhou and Zheng families had already expressed their stance, Ning Jiufan finally spoke slowly.

"My family's Ning Zhanji and others were all killed by the Shadow Demon Cultivator. And the Shadow Demon Cultivator is from the City Lord's Mansion. My Ning family has long been enemies with the City Lord's Mansion! Fei Si secretly tried to turn Ning Zhuo against us, digging at the foundation of my Ning family. This is intolerable. I am willing to fully support Lord Zhu." Ning Jiufan harbored deep hostility towards Meng Kui.

Meng Kui's External Peach Fate Core had once smashed his head, leaving a wound that would take a lifetime to heal.

Just after Ning Jiufan expressed his stance, a subordinate reported from outside, saying they had brought a letter from Ning Zhuo.

Ning Zhuo was the most crucial person at the moment, so Ning Jiufan immediately had the letter brought in.

He used his divine sense to infuse the jade slip, discovering it was a confession letter.

In the letter, Ning Zhuo vaguely mentioned that he had always maintained close contact with Fei Si in secret, with significant exchanges of interests.

Ning Zhuo also expressed his constant worry about the hidden dangers of his actions.

Not long ago, Lord Zhu Xuanji's sudden investigation made him realize the seriousness of the situation.

But many things he couldn't say, so he sought advice from the Ning family patriarch on what to do.

Additionally, Ning Zhuo inquired about the Demonic Gate's true scripture.

Lord Zhu Xuanji specifically asked about the true scripture, indicating its importance.

Ning Zhuo brought it up, hoping to provide some help to Ning Jiufan.

At the end of the letter, Ning Zhuo pleaded for the patriarch's help to save him.

"Rather than a confession letter, it's more like a plea for help!" Ning Jiufan cursed after reading the contents of the jade slip, then handed it to Zhu Xuanji.

Zhu Xuanji glanced at it and tossed it back.

Ning Jiufan then passed the jade slip to the others for them to review.

Ning Jiufan took the opportunity to say, "Ning Zhuo is a member of my Ning family and one of the most outstanding among the younger generation."

"Although his talent hasn't been fully tested yet, even the lowest level of talent can't deny his genius status." Ning Jiufan's words did not meet any objections.

All the Golden Core Stage cultivators present acknowledged Ning Zhuo's talent, believing that this young man had limitless potential, great skills, and ambition, actively striving for progress.

What he currently lacked was just cultivation.

Ning Jiufan continued, "This time, we need to use Ning Zhuo as bait to lure the City Lord's Mansion into taking a risky move. Ning Zhuo's situation will be extremely dangerous facing the City Lord's assassination attempts. I ask everyone not to be stingy with treasures and to support and protect his life. Such a genius youth is a treasure and the future of any family. As the patriarch of the Ning family and the only Golden Core Stage cultivator, I don't want Ning Zhuo to lose his life because of our plan." The Golden Core Stage cultivators exchanged glances and then looked at Zhu Xuanji.

Zhu Xuanji remained silent.

Zhou Nongying suddenly said, "Brother Ning, we all have treasures, but using them to protect Ning Zhuo might not be appropriate. Our greatest advantage is that the City Lord's Mansion doesn't know how much evidence we have against them. This is a deceptive tactic to lure them into taking risks."

"Ning Zhuo is also unaware. The more anxious and paranoid he appears, even actively seeking Fei Si's advice, the more it helps our plan. If we heavily protect him and let him know the details, such a young man, only sixteen years old, will inevitably show many flaws. Even if he doesn't, Fei Si is extremely shrewd and can smell the trap we've set from Ning Zhuo's small flaws. Facing such an opponent, we must give our all." Zhou Nongying was interrupted by Ning Jiufan's cold laugh.

"Ning Zhuo is not a member of your Zhou family. Sacrificing a genius cultivator from another family is beneficial to you." Zhou Nongying quickly retorted, "Even if it were a member of my Zhou family, no matter how talented, I would handle it the same way. After all, this kid is also guilty!"

"If he hadn't developed the Mechanical Fire Bamboo Snake and actively cooperated with the City Lord's Mansion, would the Immortal Palace have been blown up? Would things have reached this point?" Ning Jiufan coldly replied, "Even without Ning Zhuo, wouldn't the City Lord's Mansion find other ways to blow up the Immortal Palace?"

"Ning Zhuo is just too young and a member of a branch family. As a marginal figure, he has to constantly maneuver and acquire resources to enhance his cultivation and become stronger."

"This isn't about having a crooked mind or committing a crime. It's just that this young man wants to progress too much. Weren't we all like this at his age? Ning Zhuo was just used by bad people; he's innocent."

Zhou Nongying sneered, pointing at the jade slip Ning Zhuo had just sent, "In this letter, Ning Zhuo has already confessed and admitted he had foreseen the danger and always felt great psychological pressure. He should have reported this to you, the patriarch of the Ning family, much earlier, but he didn't. He held onto a strong sense of luck."

"He knew he might be aiding and abetting, might be an accomplice, but he still wanted to hide it. Isn't such behavior guilty?" Ning Jiufan was about to speak, but another jade slip was delivered.

This jade slip was not from Ning Zhuo but from Ning Xiaohui.

In fact, it was Ning Xiaohui reporting good news to her grandmother.

Her grandmother, a member of the main branch, immediately reported the situation to the Ning family patriarch.

During this time, the main branch of the Ning family had been suppressed by Ning Zhuo, feeling extremely aggrieved.

Ning Xiaohui's achievement of obtaining the position of a healer was a significant progress and accomplishment, a much-needed victory and good news for the main branch of the Ning family.

The Ning family patriarch, upon receiving this news, laughed heartily, sweeping away the usual gloom.

After pacing in his study for a while, he decided to record this information in a jade slip and present it to the Ning family patriarch, hoping to gain some favor for the main branch.

These internal intricacies were not what the Ning family patriarch wanted to focus on.

He infused his divine sense into the jade slip, checking it, and his eyebrows raised slightly, showing a hint of joy.

"Ning Xiaohui is a good child," Ning Jiufan said, stroking his beard.

He handed the jade slip to Zhu Xuanji, "Lord Zhu, this is entirely good news." Zhu Xuanji infused his divine sense, his eyes shining, and said repeatedly, "Good, good, good!"

"Today is truly a double celebration."

"Ning Xiaohui has the status of a trial disciple, an advantage none of us have."

"Her position as a healer, no matter how much merit we outsiders have, we wouldn't qualify for it."

"Wait."

"This Historical Pavilion is very important. It should record all major events since the construction of the Lava Immortal Palace. Good stuff!"

"Quickly have Ning Xiaohui accumulate merits and strive to be promoted to the pavilion master of the Historical Pavilion as soon as possible!"

"The explosion of the Lava Immortal Palace must be recorded in the Historical Pavilion. This is the most solid evidence."

Zhou Nongying frowned, "Even if the Historical Pavilion records the explosion of the Immortal Palace by the Shadow Demon Cultivator, we can't use this evidence to bring down the Meng family. On the surface, the Meng family has no connection with the Shadow Demon Cultivator."

Zhu Xuanji nodded, "So, we still need to work from Ning Zhuo's line. Only by attacking from both sides can we gain something."

At this point, Zhu Xuanji looked at Ning Jiufan.

He said sincerely, "Brother Ning."

"I have been honest with you about my plans."

"Ning Zhuo is a member of your Ning family, so I personally went to him this time, without using any severe torture or soul-searching techniques. This is my sincerity!"

"How could I, Zhu Xuanji, treat a meritorious person unfairly?"

As a member of the Divine Constable Division, Zhu Xuanji had many severe interrogation methods at his disposal.

But as a member of the royal family, he knew very well that using these methods would be truly disastrous.

In the current situation, Zhu Xuanji, alone in Fire Persimmon Immortal City, needed to unite the three families to fight against Meng Kui, the City Lord.

Otherwise, he would be isolated and helpless.

The previous battle with the Fire Fusion Demon Ape was a successful operation.

Zhu Xuanji's leadership and courage during the operation made the three Golden Core Stage cultivators feel his sincerity.

If he disregarded the previous alliance and Ning Jiufan's feelings because of the Demonic Gate's true scripture and took severe measures against Ning Zhuo, it would be like killing the donkey after it had done its job, easily alienating others.

Especially since Ning Jiufan was the biggest contributor in the volcano expedition!

Zhu Xuanji had just praised Ning Jiufan and acknowledged his contribution.

If he then turned against his family members, who would believe his praise and promises?

Using soul-searching and other severe methods was not Zhu Xuanji's style.

Hearing Zhu Xuanji's words, Ning Jiufan lowered his head, thought for a moment, and then said, "Lord Zhu, I trust you."

Zhu Xuanji said, "Let Ning Zhuo atone for his sins with meritorious deeds."

"The situation has reached this point; he has become a pawn. Even if we didn't discover the clue about the true scripture, his situation would still be dangerous. To be honest, I quite like this little guy."

"As the saying goes, jade must be polished to become a useful tool. Let him be tempered more; it's good for him."

"I can assure you that within three days, I will disguise myself and stay by Ning Zhuo's side. If the City Lord's Mansion makes a move, even if the Shadow Demon Cultivator himself comes, I will do my best to protect Ning Zhuo's life."

After saying this, Zhu Xuanji fell silent, looking at Ning Jiufan.

The hall fell into silence.

The other four Golden Core Stage cultivators also looked at Ning Jiufan, silently applying pressure.

Ning Jiufan's face was solemn.

He looked at the jade slip in his hand—Ning Zhuo's confession letter.

He then looked at the jade slip in Zhu Xuanji's hand, which was Ning Xiaohui's victory report.

One was from a branch family, the other from the main family.

At this moment, Ning Jiufan felt a touch in his heart, realizing he seemed to be facing a fateful choice.

He had never met Ning Zhuo, but he had met Ning Xiaohui.

At this moment, the image of an old friend appeared in his mind, entrusting him with the care of his descendants before his death.

Ning Jiufan sighed deeply and made a decision, "Very well, let's proceed as you suggest."
