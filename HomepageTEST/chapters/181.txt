Chapter 181: Giant Ghost Axe

"More money?" Zhu Xuanji laughed heartily, "That's negotiable!"

However, when Zheng Shuangjun reported the specific amount of spirit stones, Zhu Xuanji's expression changed.

He looked astonished, his eyes asking—are you serious?

Thus, the second negotiation fell through because Zheng Shuangjun's asking price was too high.

Both parties agreed to reconsider and scheduled a third meeting.

"These local cultivation families..." Zhu Xuanji gritted his teeth.

After the recruitment order, his pressure increased exponentially.

More and more cultivators were flooding into Fire Persimmon Immortal City, and the City Lord's Mansion had successfully recruited several Golden Core Stage cultivators with profound expertise in mechanical constructs.

These Golden Core Stage cultivators entered the Lava Immortal Palace, working closely together, catching up to Zhu Xuanji at a visible speed.

Zhu Xuanji knew very well that this was the Meng family's ploy, using this method to bring in reinforcements to help Meng Kui compete for the Lava Immortal Palace.

The Zheng family needed the Lava Immortal Palace to gain influence over Fire Persimmon Immortal City!

Zhu Xuanji's plan was to retrieve the lost Golden Core mechanical puppet demon general.

Using the Tracing Origin Technique, he saw that the demon general puppet was lost deep within Fire Persimmon Mountain.

That area was the royal court of the Fire Melting Apes, ruled by a Golden Core Stage demon ape king, with other Golden Core Stage demon apes present.

In such a situation, Zhu Xuanji alone could not retrieve the puppet demon general.

Therefore, he discussed with the Zhou, Zheng, and Ning families, seeking the help of five Golden Core Stage cultivators to jointly attack the Fire Melting Apes' lair in Fire Persimmon Mountain and reclaim the puppet demon general.

The first negotiation failed, and the second one also faced setbacks.

Zhu Xuanji, being a divine constable, pondered for a while and realized, "The three families are stalling for time. After all, venturing into Fire Persimmon Mountain with me is a life-threatening risk."

"They want to confirm if there's another opportunity. If the opportunity is significant, they won't agree to risk their lives with me. This means the three families' reformation teams must be planning something big."

Zhou Family.

Underground hall.

All members of the three families' reformation teams gathered, listening attentively to Zheng Hua teaching them the "Ghost Weapon Cultivation Art."

"Remember, operating this technique will cut off thirty percent of your soul. During this period, you will experience extreme pain."

"Our clan has prepared corresponding pills for you. If you can't endure it, you can take one to alleviate the pain. But I don't recommend doing so."

"Because the pain signifies the close connection between the soul fragments. Maintaining this connection is very helpful for forging the ghost martial weapon."

"But if you take the pill, it will greatly weaken this connection. Even if the ghost martial weapon is forged, it won't be perfectly compatible with your body."

"Of course, if necessary, you must take the pill. Passing out from the pain would have even more severe consequences!"

Zheng Hua explained in detail and then took out his own ghost martial weapon to show everyone.

Afterward, he had a Zhou family reformation team cultivator cut off a portion of his soul and use soul power to forge his own ghost martial weapon in front of everyone.

After understanding and mastering this unique forging technique, some began tempering their weapons.

"It hurts, my heavens!" The first person to try, under countless eyes, did not take the pill.

As a result, he rolled his eyes and fainted.

Fortunately, Zheng Hua and others were closely monitoring and intervened in time.

The fainted cultivator quickly stabilized under their treatment, avoiding life-threatening backlash.

Seeing this live example and the bloody lesson, the other reformation team cultivators chose a more conservative approach.

If they couldn't endure the pain, they immediately swallowed the pill.

"Ah—!" Ning Yong screamed, his voice hoarse, but he didn't take the pill.

In contrast, Ning Chen, after experiencing a bit of the soul-cutting pain, immediately swallowed the pill hidden under his tongue.

Ning Zhuo carefully pondered the essence and did not act.

He looked at the other geniuses.

Zheng Jian, a member of the Zheng family, had long used the Ghost Weapon Cultivation Art.

He displayed a ghost martial bow in front of everyone.

Zhou Zhu, Zhou Zeshen operated the technique one after another.

Zhou Zhu groaned, and Zhou Zeshen's brows furrowed, his face twisted.

Both endured without taking the pill.

Ning Xiaohui looked at Ning Zhuo and sneered, "How long will you wait? Are you afraid, Ning Zhuo?"

Ning Zhuo smiled, "You are the main branch of the Ning family, and I am just a collateral branch. Of course, I should let you go first. Otherwise, if you lose to me again, wouldn't it disgrace the entire main branch?"

Provoked by Ning Zhuo, Ning Xiaohui laughed heartily this time.

She displayed a ghost sword, "Open your dog eyes wide and see clearly what this is!"

Seeing this, Zhou Zeshen's pupils shrank, confirming that the Ning and Zheng families were very close and had already cooperated.

Ning Zhuo was slightly surprised, then sneered, "You got the tempering technique early and used it for yourself, forgetting about the rest of our reformation team."

"You secretly forged it and took the pill without anyone knowing. Clever, well done."

Ning Xiaohui's face turned pale with anger, "Insolent! You, a mere collateral branch, dare to slander the main branch."

Ning Zhuo: "Then prove to everyone that you didn't secretly take the pill while tempering the ghost martial weapon."

Ning Xiaohui was about to retort when Ning Xie finally couldn't stand it, "Enough! There's no need to argue over this. Ning Zhuo, why haven't you started?"

"Or do you need my help?"

Ning Zhuo laughed heartily, stopped talking, and began operating the tempering technique in front of everyone.

His body trembled slightly, thirty percent of his soul was cut off, the pain was excruciating, but he only furrowed his brows, his eyes firm and unwavering.

"I did it, I did it!"

"Look at my ghost martial hammer, uh, why is it so small?"

"I wanted to forge a sword, but why did I get a small knife?"

Zheng Jian, Zheng Hua, and others witnessed various results of the ghost martial tempering, their expressions unchanged, as they had expected.

"What?!"

"What's going on!"

"Ning Zhuo, you..."

Ning Zhuo successfully tempered a giant ghost axe floating in front of him.

The axe was enormous, like a door had been taken down.

Such a huge ghost axe stood in stark contrast to the tiny ghost martial weapons around.

Zheng Jian, Ning Xiaohui's ghost martial weapons were instantly overshadowed.

Their ghost martial weapons were just normal-sized.

"Brother Zhuo is mighty!" Ning Yong was the first to cheer.

Soon, the Ning family's collateral branch cultivators laughed and cheered, sincerely happy for Ning Zhuo.

Zhou Zeshen looked at his normal-sized soul fan and couldn't help but ask, "Brother Ning, why is your soul so vast and abundant?"

"Thanks to the contributions of the Soul Devouring Sect cultivators," Ning Zhuo didn't reveal the truth, only saying, "I've recently realized that after each exploration of the Immortal Palace, my soul is consumed. When it fully recovers, it seems to be more abundant than before."

Everyone was speechless.

After a few breaths of silence, someone suddenly asked, "Brother Ning Zhuo, what is your innate talent?"

"I don't know either," Ning Zhuo spread his hands.

An undetected innate talent was his best and most convenient excuse!

Ning Xiaohui snorted coldly and turned her head away.

With the ghost martial weapons forged, Zheng Hua distributed various pills, mainly to heal the soul or accelerate its recovery.

Then, under the guidance of another Zheng family elder, everyone actively practiced using the ghost martial weapons.

Afterward, they practiced mechanical constructs, tactical drills, and more.

After several days, the reformation team was completely transformed! Their combat power surged!

The three family heads urged repeatedly, and the reformation team set off for the Immortal Palace without rest.

Lava Immortal Palace.

The puppets arrived at the first gate.

They lined up orderly to receive their rewards.

Everyone moved quickly and without hesitation.

This was because the reward options and quantities had been discussed and predetermined.

Room one, room two, room three.

"No mechanical apes found!" Everyone cheered.

They happily entered the first preparation room.

The cultivators divided their tasks, led by Ning Zhuo and Zheng Jian, working hard to create various mechanical constructs.

Room four, room five, room six.

In the second preparation room, the cultivators bought higher-grade materials and made more constructs.

Room seven, room eight!

The Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng appeared.

"Finally encountered."

"Room eight is much deeper than we imagined."

"We will win this battle!"

The three families united, their morale soaring.

Yuan Dasheng roared and charged at the crowd.

The three families united, fully alert, as if facing a great enemy!

"Thunderbolt crossbows, fire!" Zheng Jin shouted.

In the team, eight bed crossbows instantly activated, arrows covered in lightning shot out.

Eight bolts of lightning shot straight out, hitting the Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng.

The Golden Blood Battle Ape Dasheng's movements halted, pierced by eight lightning-covered eight-foot-long arrows, the arrows embedded deep into the floor, pinning Yuan Dasheng in place.

Yuan Dasheng struggled, but the powerful electric currents made him convulse, broken mechanical parts spilling from his wounds.

"Success!"

"Hahaha, didn't expect a one-hit kill."

"The thunderbolt crossbows are amazing, even though they can only fire once, their power is extraordinary, truly worth it." Everyone cheered.

"Hurry, dismantle the mechanical ape."

"Don't let the electric current damage the interior, we need more information!" Several cultivators rushed forward.
